WRITTEN QUESTION E-1986/10 by Roger Helmer (ECR) to the Commission (6 April 2010) Subject: Spanish mobile phone law — unfair practice I have been contacted by a constituent who bought two Spanish pay-as-you-go phones two years ago. He has been topping them up online every three months for the past two years via his Spanish bank account in order to keep them activated, the last top-up being in November 2009. The combined balance on the two phones was, at that time, over EUR 200. However, the phones have been de-activated without repayment of the credit to the constituent, as the Spanish Government has apparently decided that everyone needs to present a passport and proof of domicile in Spain to keep their pay-as-you-go phone activated. This appears to contravene the very idea of a free trade area, and I wonder therefore what the Commission plans to do about this unfair practice, and how my constituent can claim back the money he has lost.
