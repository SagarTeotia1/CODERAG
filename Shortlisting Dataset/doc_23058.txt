Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (27 April 2010) Maize MON810 has been cultivated in the European Union since 1998, and has been subject to close monitoring and numerous studies with regards to its effects on human and animal health and the environment. In particular the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in its recent opinion for the renewal of the authorisation of that maize Published on 30 June 2009. , confirmed the absence of adverse effects on human and animal health and the environment. Furthermore the Commission has brought to the attention of EFSA all scientific evidence that supported the national safeguard measures of the six Member States. In all of its opinions EFSA confirmed the positive assessment of this genetically modified organism (GMO). EFSA opinion on MON810 is based on the scientific data available in the application, the risk assessment carried out by a national competent authority — as provided by Regulation 1829/2003 OJ L 268, 18.10.2003. , as well as on the most updated scientific literature concerning the potential health and environmental effects of this product. In addition, in its overall scientific assessment, EFSA takes into account the comments made by Member States as well as the Commission. Concerning the renewal of authorisation for cultivation of the genetically modified maize MON810, the Commission will proceed with it step — by — step, in accordance with our established procedures and the provisions of EC law and in light of the direction that the President has set out in his Political Guidelines for the new Commission, namely to combine a Union authorisation system with respect to cultivation of GMOs, based on science, with freedom for Member States to decide whether or not they wish to cultivate genetically modified crops on their territory.
