Pöttering reprimands Maciej Giertych MEP over pamphlet Parliament's Rules of Procedure 2007-03-14 - 10:02 The President of the European Parliament Hans-Gert Pöttering reprimanded non-attached Polish MEP Maciej Giertych following his publication of a pamphlet ("Civilizations at War in Europe") containing anti-semitic and xenophobic statements in accordance with Article 147 of the Rules of Procedure. President Pöttering had already clearly condemned "Statements based on racism or anti-semitism" as being "against the fundamental values of the European Union". President Pöttering said to the plenary in Strasbourg: "On this occasion I deeply regretted what is objectively a serious breach of the fundamental rights and in particular the dignity of human beings to which our institution so strongly adheres. On this basis, I have decided, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Rule 147, that a reprimand should be imposed on you, which is the first of the measures referred to in the aforementioned rule. The plenary, together with the other relevant political bodies of the House, will be duly informed once you are notified of this penalty. During my presidency, I intend to safeguard both the freedom of expression and the standard of conduct of Members, as well as the honour of this House. As I declared on 13 February 2007 in my inaugural address to the plenary, tolerance and respect for others are important European values, which are at the centre of my political priorities and to which the European Parliament is deeply committed. I trust you will understand that the European Parliament, which thrives on lively political debate and unfailingly condemns all forms of xenophobia, should under no circumstances be associated with the views published in your brochure." President Pöttering has been previously assured by the Parliament's administration that the European Parliament has not made any financial contribution to this publication. Rules 147 (see links) of EP Rules of Procedure states: 1.

When assessing the conduct observed, account shall be taken of its exceptional, recurrent or permanent nature and of its seriousness, on the basis of the guidelines annexed to these Rules of Procedure(1). 3. The penalty may consist of one or more of the following measures: (a) a reprimand; (b) forfeiture of entitlement to the daily subsistence allowance for a period of between 2 and 10 days; (c) without prejudice to the right to vote in plenary, and subject, in this instance, to strict compliance with the Members' standards of conducts, temporary suspension, for a period of between 2 and 10 consecutive days on which Parliament or any of its bodies, committees or delegations meet, from participation in all or some of the activities of Parliament; (d) submission to the Conference of Presidents, pursuant
