has been tasked to deal with. Corruption is, therefore, not particularly emphasized in the last Union Organized Crime reports. Europol's task is to support Member States in their efforts to fight organized crime. This will also apply for the Candidate Countries once they have acceded to the Union as well as to the Europol Convention. This support function can only be carried out in close cooperation with all Member States, in future including also the new members. Europol does not have any power to monitor the corruption situation in the Union and its neighbouring countries. Any involvement of Europol requires an approach based on partnership. A report on the organized crime situation in the future Member States including the situation in the area of corruption would only be feasible in close cooperation with the countries concerned and based on their contributions. In order to get an overall picture any approach should focus on the whole Union and not be limited to just the new Member States. If this became an additional priority for Europol it would be necessary to consider in the competent fora the need for allocation of additional means to Europol in order to enable the organization to cope successfully with the additional tasks.
