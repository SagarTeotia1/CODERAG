Question for written answer E-004992/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 William (The Earl of) Dartmouth (EFD) (23 May 2011) Subject: Disclosure of the number of non-contract staff in delegations administering aid In the light of recent adverse press reports and the report of the European Court of Auditors (1/2011) on EU aid and given that on its own admission the EU is the largest aid donor in the world with EUR 8.5 bn in 2009, a figure which is rising rapidly: will the Commission disclose the number of non-contract staff in delegations wholly or largely administering aid? (It is noted that 1500 staff were moved to the aid programme between 2001 and 2005.)
