of activities which may be financed by the ESF. The ESF is the major financial instrument of European social policy. It contributes to the economic and social cohesion objective set in article 158 of the EC Treaty, by supporting policies and priorities aimed to achieve progress towards full employment, improve quality and productivity at work and promote social inclusion and cohesion in line with the guidelines and recommendations under the European Employment Strategy (EES). In order to achieve this objective, the ESF needs to address three major challenges: employment disparities, social inequalities, skills gaps and labour shortage in an enlarged Union; economic and social restructuring due to globalisation and the development of the knowledge-based economy; demographic changes which have resulted in a shrinking and ageing workforce. What next? Following the adoption of the texts by plenary, the funds can be used from 1 January 2007. Before the money can be finally allocated to the Member States, the Commission will draw up, most likely in late July, Community Strategic Guidelines, on which Parliament will vote (under the assent procedure) in September. These are the starting point for the national reference frameworks and operational plans to be negotiated between the Commission and individual Member States in the Autumn. 20060628IPR09333 ESF, Cohesion Fund (general provisions) Establishment of a Cohesion Fund European Social Fund European Regional Development Fund European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC) Country by country breakdown of funds (click on the Annex) EN 1 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5188922 EN 2 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5188642 EN 3 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5189512 EN 4 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5189402 EN 5 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5189522 EN 6 LINK http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/interim4_en.htm -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
