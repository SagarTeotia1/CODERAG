Human rights in East Timor, Syria and North Korea Human rights 2006-06-15 - 17:28 As usual, Parliament ended its session in Strasbourg with three debates on human rights issues from around the world. In this case, the focus was on East Timor, Syria and North Korea. East Timor In its resolution on East Timor, Parliament urges all parties to refrain from violence, to get involved in an all-inclusive dialogue to settle political differences and to participate in the democratic process within the legal and constitutional framework, thus contributing to restoring social and political stability. It welcomes the decision by the authorities of East Timor to call for an international inquiry into the events of 28-29 April, and 23-25 May, when armed confrontations between the East Timorese armed forces and previously dismissed soldiers and their civilian supporters resulted in a disputed number of fatalities.

MEPs welcome East Timor's admission to the ACP group of States and recognise its need for political, technical and financial support in rebuilding the infrastructure and administrative structures which are essential to resume the implementation of its development plan. They call on the European Union and international community to maintain and step up the support required to consolidate democracy and a democratic culture in East Timor, focusing on a multiparty culture and institution-building – namely the parliament, government, judiciary, security, defence and law enforcement forces – and to assist in the urgent extension of media coverage to the whole country, as well as in strengthening the education and health networks, with particular
