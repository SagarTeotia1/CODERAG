Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (9 July 2008) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑1517/08 by Ms Hennis-Plasschaert. As regards the last point raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission expressed its position on this issue at the Parliament Plenary on 16 February 2006 on the occasion of the debate that followed the publication of cartoons of Prophet Mohammed in various European newspapers. Ever since, the Commission recalled its position in its replies to different parliamentary questions, last in its reply to Question E‑1517/08 , which concerned the release of the film ‘Fitna’. This position was again recalled by the President of the Commission at the press conference of the meeting referred to by the Honourable Member, when the President underlined that freedom of speech is a fundamental principle lying at the very core of European values and the EU and its Member States are strongly committed to guarantee and protect it. He also stressed that, while some opinions might aggrieve other people’s personal beliefs, freedom of speech remains the basis not only of the possibility to express an opinion, but also the basis of the possibility to rebut an opinion.
