Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (7 October 2011) In the coming weeks, the Commission is foreseeing to adopt a proposal for new TEN‑T guidelines. Following an extensive consultation process, a dual layer approach with a wide, comprehensive network and a core network for the highest priorities and EU added value, will be proposed. As the Kiel Canal presents a strategic importance for the EU, the Commission is also looking at this Canal. With regards to TEN‑T grant application for the adaptation or construction work of the Kiel Canal, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that are no ‘ongoing’ nor ‘closed’ projects related to the Kiel Canal financed through TEN‑T funds. Moreover, the Commission has not received any proposal for funding under the previous calls.
