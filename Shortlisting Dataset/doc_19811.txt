WRITTEN QUESTION P-3094/10 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (27 April 2010) Subject: The Eyjafjallajökull eruption obligations on re-routing passengers The European Union has established common rules on assistance to passengers in the event of flight cancellations and long delays, under Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 OJ L 46, 17.2.2004, p. 1. . Thousands of passengers’ journeys have been disrupted by the volcanic ash cloud from the Eyjafjallajökull eruption. The airline Tui UK and Ireland has stated its customers who rebook to a different flight of their choice which is more expensive than their original one must cover the difference themselves. In certain circumstances, Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 gives passengers the right to reimbursement or for the passenger’s journey to be rerouted to their final destination at a later date at the passenger’s convenience, subject to availability of seats, and that carriers shall bear the cost of transferring the passenger from that alternative airport either to that for which the booking was made, or to another nearby destination agreed with the passenger. In addition, Article 10 states that where air carriers place a passenger in a class higher than that for which the ticket was purchased, it may not request any supplementary payment. In light of this, is the Commission aware of this stance? Does the Commission think that Tui’s position is compliant with the obligations under the regulation?
