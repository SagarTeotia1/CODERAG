ORAL QUESTION H-0948/06 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Mihael Brejc to the Commission Subject: Restrictions on the effective functioning of the internal market One of the EU's fundamental principles is to guarantee a level playing field so that everyone can compete in the market on an equal basis. At the moment, however, certain Member States are at a disadvantage on account of restrictions concerning the free flow of persons or the Schengen area. Most of the countries concerned have a level of development below the EU average, and such barriers are just one more obstacle to faster development. What action does the Commission intend to take to speed up the removal of these barriers and create appropriate conditions for healthy competition?
