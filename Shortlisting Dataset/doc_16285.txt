WRITTEN QUESTION P-0117/05 by María Salinas García (PSE) to the Commission (19 January 2005) Subject: Impact of introduction of tolls in Germany on Spanish fruit and vegetable exports The representatives of the Spanish fruit and vegetable sector, which is heavily dependent on road transport, have recently expressed their alarm and concern over the newly introduced tolls affecting lorries using German roads. They see this as creating a considerable and unjustified loss of competitiveness for Spanish exports, especially to eastern Europe and the Baltic states: Turkey, another major fruit and vegetable exporter, will not be faced with this toll. The chambers of commerce, producers' organisations and agricultural unions believe that the volume of exports of fresh consumer products affected by the toll will amount to 3 m tonnes, or 30% of all exports to the countries concerned. The sector estimates that the price per kilo of fruit or vegetables could rise by up to one eurocent in the wake of the German toll. The following should be taken into account: — this could particularly affect exports from regions such as Andalusia, where transport costs are already higher for reasons of geographical remoteness; — the introduction of the tolls could be considered an obstacle to a unified European common market and a distortion of the free movement of goods; — in view of Germany's role as a transit country, the tolls could disturb the flow of trade with the Nordic countries or the new Community partners; — a precedent could be created, encouraging other EU Member States to introduce similar tolls. Does the Commission not believe that the introduction by Germany of tolls on lorries amounts to a distortion of the principle of the free movement of goods? What measures will the Commission take to put an end to this discrimination against Spanish exports?
