by Hélène Flautre (Greens/EFA, FR) and Rui Tavares (GUE/NGL, PT). Marie-Christine Vergiat (GUE/NGL, FR) believed the deportations were continuing on the basis of administrative documents with priorities that were "completely mixed up", which themselves could constitute a violation of European law. "The case has not been filed away", said Mrs Reding, explaining that her department was continuing to study the matter and had requested further information from the French authorities. "I have made clear my deep disappointment about the circular of 5 August. It was amended on 13 September. What has happened since, and what is happening now?" she wondered, before adding "we must examine the copies of the deportation order so as understand clearly what has happened. We need figures, all the figures, before we can continue our analysis". Social integration of the Rom and use of EU funds "The structural funds can improve the situation of the Rom. The Commission has set up a Task Force on the Rom, which among other things will report on the way Community funds have been used until now. It will be available before the end of the year", said Commissioner László Andor. "Mrs Reding said that European funds could have been used more effectively. Perhaps they weren't and perhaps we need stricter controls", said Salvatore Iacolino (EPP, IT). "Many Member States can do more" in this field, "starting with Bulgaria and Romania", he added. "Where are the funds that the people of Europe have paid for these people?" asked Mario Borghezio (EFD, IT). The need to scrutinise the use of EU funding was a concern shared by Csaba Öry (EPP, HU), who felt that "the social integration of the Roma must focus on school, education and employment". "What is striking is the commitment of the European Commission to the values of the EU, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights really does alter the picture", stressed Pervenche Bérès (S&D, FR), chair of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee. "We will be vigilant about the fight against poverty as part of the reform of the structural funds and in particular the European Social Fund (ESF). The EU2020 Strategy must also produce results". 20100927IPR83712 Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee Employment and Social Affairs Committee European Commission press release on steps vis-à-vis France European Parliament press release on EP resolution EN 1 LINK /activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=LIBE EN 2 LINK /activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=EMPL EN 3 LINK http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/1207 EN 4 LINK /en/pressroom/content/20100909IPR81794 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
