WRITTEN QUESTION E-5699/06 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (5 January 2007) Subject: Implementation of Birds and Habitats Directives in Bulgaria and Romania in final preparations for accession: Via Pontica wind farms Is the Commission satisfied that Bulgaria and Romania are adequately protecting potential Natura 2000 sites during final preparations for accession? In particular is the Commission concerned about the very large numbers of wind turbines currently being planned in proposed special protection areas on the internationally important ‘Via Pontica’ migration route in the Dobrudja areas of Bulgaria and Romania, for example, wind farms at Kaliakra in Bulgaria and the Danube Delta in Romania? Are the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives being properly fulfilled in relation to these projects?
