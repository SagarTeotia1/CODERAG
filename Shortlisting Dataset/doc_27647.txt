Montenegro PM Milo Djukanovic hopeful of a European Union future External relations 2008-06-24 - 15:56 Montenegro's Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic at the EP, 23 July The aim of Montenegro is to be ready to join the European Union by 2012. That was the goal Montenegro's PM Milo Djukanovic spelled out to MEPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee Monday. The former basketball player has led the former ex-Yugoslav state since 1991 and championed the successful "Yes" vote in a referendum on independence in 2006. We caught up with Mr Djukanovic and asked him about Montenegro's EU hopes, Kosovo and why the country is happy using the euro. Montenegro became independent just 2 years ago. Why do you want to join the EU now? How can the EU help you solve your problems? At the time when we were struggling to become independent we were saying very clearly that we wanted to take charge of our future, which we have always known lies in Europe . Why do we want to be part of the EU? It is simply because we share the same values. It is not, as it might seem, that a small state like ours wants to get something from pre-accession funds.

Everyone brings something special and so will Montenegro - even a state as small as ours can enrich a union which is already as rich as the EU. A value that we are proud of - particularly having in mind the regional context - is multiculturalism. It has not always been regarded as an asset in the region that we live in but as a handicap in the decade that started in 1990. That is why for such a long time we had fanatical religious wars there. Though Montenegro is the smallest state in the region, it has managed to preserve peace, strengthen its multiethnic harmony, win the confidence of the international community and of foreign investors and develop very dynamically. The natural beauty of Montenegro is that we have an extremely beautiful Adriatic coast with a picturesque hinterland, high mountains, deep canyons and big lakes. Was Montenegro an example and or a precedent for Kosovo? How do you see Kosovo’s future? Is a normalisation of relations with Serbia possible? It is inevitable. Sooner or later Serbia has to come to terms with the policy mistakes that it has made during a number of decades. Regrettably there was no readiness on either side for an agreed solution, so what followed was a declaration of independence by Kosovo. Many important member states of
