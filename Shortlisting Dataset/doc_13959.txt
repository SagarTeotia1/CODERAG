WRITTEN QUESTION P-5578/07 by Marco Cappato (ALDE) to the Commission (9 November 2007) Subject: Ban on the transcription of same-sex marriages in Italy On 18 October 2007, by way of Circular No 55 (Doc. No 15100/397/0009861), the Italian Minister for Internal Affairs, Giulio Amato, officially requested the prefects of the Italian Republic and mayors throughout Italy not to allow the transcription, in that country, of same-sex marriages contracted abroad (in states whose law permits that type of civil union). The circular states that ‘requests for the transcription of such acts executed abroad must be refused since they contravene internal public policy’. Circular No 55 violates the principle of non-discrimination in respect of homosexual Italian citizens, who should enjoy the same respect and the same rights as all other citizens, and runs counter to certain basic principles of the Italian Constitution, such as the principles of equality and non‑discrimination, development of the individual and protection of individuals' fundamental rights in all social groups expressing their personality (Articles 2, 3 and 13 of the Constitution). Does the Commission not consider this measure to violate the principle of the equality of all European citizens, as well as restricting the right to freedom of movement?
