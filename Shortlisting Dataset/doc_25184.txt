and preserving structural aids, E. whereas the external dimension of the CFP thus plays an important and varied social and economic role for both the developing countries and the European Union, and constitutes a basic food supply source in global terms, F. whereas fishing is, to varying extents, an important source of food and income for all developing countries with which the EU has a fisheries agreement; whereas it is self-evident that each country has the right to manage its own Exclusive Economic Zone, G. having regard to the increasing importance of the RFOs as multilateral resource management bodies which offer a suitable forum for resolving differences between parties and practising responsible management, while also combating illegal fishing and fishing under flags of convenience; having regard to the need for coordination between the Commission, Member States, the RFOs and third countries with a view to creating a monitoring policy and a coherent system of sanctions at world level, thus boosting the fight against illegal fishing, H. having regard to the EC's exclusive competences regarding the external dimension of the CFP, whereby the Commission is responsible not only for representing the Community's interests and ensuring implementation of the commitments made but also for the guidance, coordination and preparation of the Community's positions in international cooperation forums, and whereas, for various reasons, these competences have not yet been effectively and coherently developed, I. having regard to the responsibility of the two branches of the budgetary authority, the Council and Parliament, to ensure that the Commission has sufficient human and financial resources to carry out the tasks and duties incumbent on it in the context of the external dimension of the CFP, 1. Recognises the importance of the activity of the Community's seagoing and ocean-going fleet fishing in non-Community waters for meeting EU consumers' food needs and for the preservation of the industrial fabric in the EU's maritime regions, as well as its positive impact on economic and social cohesion in those mostly less-favoured or peripheral regions; 2. Regrets the lack of a debate to date on the external dimension of the CFP, with the Community's actions as regards participation in RFOs and signing international agreements being more the reflection of an inert and unstructured serendipity than of a strategy for the defence of its interests and those of its fisheries sector; 3. Calls, therefore, for the development of a CFP which is linked to the Union's external policy and, in conjunction with the CFSP and with development and trade policy, is able to support, at the level of international forums, the principles of fishing that is responsible, consistent with the interests of the Community fleet and geared to the long-term, responsible and sustainable development of the sector; 4. Insists that, given the Community's exclusive competences as regards the external dimension of the CFP, it is the Commission that must be responsible for proper representation, effective negotiation, coordination, participation in scientific meetings and forums, and relations with RFOs generally, including fisheries monitoring; calls on the Commission, accordingly, when it adopts its communication on the external
