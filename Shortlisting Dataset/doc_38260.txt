location for R&D for industry and the dramatic decline of risk capital activity; calls on the Member States to increase the number and attractiveness of research positions and improve the career development for researchers in order to prevent the 'brain drain' to the US; 19. Calls for an urgent mobilisation of private-sector investment for R&D with a special focus on seed and start-ups venture capital for microenterprises and SMEs ; 20. Encourages the improvement of framework conditions for R&D in Europe such as more research and innovation-friendly state aid and public procurement rules, the setting up of a legal framework for public - private partnerships, adequate intellectual property rights systems and highly qualified, adaptable and mobile human resources; calls for a strong public research base with links with industry in the context of EU regional and cohesion policies and of the financial instruments targeted particularly at the accession countries; calls for the realisation of a European research area; encourages the opening of national R&D systems and programmes to transnational collaboration; 21. Notes with concern that Europe has lost its advance in environmentally friendly technologies and renewable energies in the past years; recalls the strategy for sustainable development set at the Gothenburg European Council and demands that it be put at the centre of a coherent industrial policy, favouring the introduction of new and environmentally friendly technologies such as nano- and bio- communication, and other clean technologies, in particular in the field of energy, investments in greenhouse mitigation measures and transport; supports, in particular, their wider use and those projects aimed at transforming research into economically viable innovation, acknowledging their growth potential; 22. Stresses the importance of reducing Europe's dependence on oil imports, which constitutes a heavy burden from the political and price volatility point of view; welcomes technology platforms such as the European Partnership for a Hydrogen Economy; encourages further investment in the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy, which will reduce the volatility of the cost per unit of energy, increase the security of energy supply, be less harmful to the environment, and potentially trigger an industrial revolution similar to the IT-led industrial revolution in the US; 23. Calls for an intensified public-private partnership with particular support for SMEs, and the development of a coherent industrial policy; supports measures to establish and keep the R&D centres of industry within the EU; encourages an increase of public financial support to business R&D; calls for intensified co-operation between public research institutions and industry, with a special focus on SMEs, a stronger participation of industry in the determination of priorities for public research, but also a substantial increase of private sector financial contribution thereto; supports the promotion of technology transfer of publicly-funded or public-privately funded research to industry and spin-off creation; strongly welcomes networks of excellence, public-private R&D partnerships, business incubators and clusters leading to knowledge transfer and commercialisation of R&D results; calls on the EIB to develop new funding arrangements to foster the development and market introduction of new technologies, including grouped loans for specific research activities, technology platforms, and simplified lending procedures
