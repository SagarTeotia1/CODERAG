ORAL QUESTION H-0720/02 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Jan Andersson to the Commission Subject: Commission proposal to amend its decision setting up EURES The Commission intends to amend and update its decision of 22 December 1993 setting up EURES. At the present time, the EURES cross-border partnerships typically have a strong regional base and a fundamental role for trade unions and employers' organisations. Funding goes from the Commission directly to the regional EURES operation. One of the features of the Commission's proposal to revise the decision is to establish closer links between EURES and the national employment services, primarily with the forthcoming enlargement of the EU in view. This proposal, however, gives rise to a number of questions concerning the independence of the regional partnerships, in particular their financial independence, from the national labour market authorities. How does the Commission see future funding in the light of EURES' independence hitherto? How does the Commission envisage that the important role played by trade unions and employers' organisations will be maintained?
