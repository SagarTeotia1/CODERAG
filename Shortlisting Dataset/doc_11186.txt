WRITTEN QUESTION E-3315/06 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (19 July 2006) Subject: Development of a new EU fishing policy In order to move towards a fishing policy that aims to restore stocks to the point where they can provide a maximum sustainable yield it will be necessary to reduce temporarily the quantities of fish caught in EU waters. Does the Commission envisage that during this transition period there will be a reduction in the total amount of fish available for sale on the EU market, or does it anticipate an increase in the already very high (60 %) proportion of imported products supplied to the EU market? If the latter, what measures does the Commission intend to put in place to ensure that the restoration of fish stocks in European waters is not at the expense of the survival of fish stocks elsewhere in the world, given that fishing practices globally are almost wholly unsustainable?
