Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (12 March 2012) The Commission has not been informed by the Greek authorities about this project. It is the responsibility of Greek competent authorities to ensure that the planning and authorisation of the dam in question complies with EU legislation, in particular the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. , taking also into account any cumulative impacts from other infrastructure projects affecting the River Aliakmon ecosystem. In light of the information supplied by the Honourable Member the Commission will investigate the case with the Greek authorities in order to verify whether the EU environmental legislation is complied with.
