canariensis\" is one of a group of unrelated Canarian plants that appear to be adapted for bird pollination, including the members of the genera \"Isoplexis\" and \"Lotus\".", " It was once thought that the original pollinators of these plants were sunbirds which had become extinct on the Canary Islands, explaining why some of these species are rare and considered endangered (Vogel 1954; Vogel et al. 1984; Olesen 1985; Valido et al. 2004).", " However more recent work has shown that these plants are adequately pollinated by non-specialist flower visiting birds, particularly the Canary Islands chiffchaff (\"Phylloscopus canariensis\") and the Canary Island spectacled warbler (\"Sylvia conspicillata orbitalis\") (Olesen 1985; Ollerton et al. 2008), and in fact show some specific adaptations to infrequent pollination by these birds, such as extended flower lifespans (Ollerton et al. 2008), and a hexose-dominated sugar ratio of the nectar (Dupont et al. 2004)." ] ], [ "Erinacea", [ "Erinacea is a small genus of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae." ] ] ] }
