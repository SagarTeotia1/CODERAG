WRITTEN QUESTION E-6306/07 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (17 December 2007) Subject: Animal disease testing With regard to animal disease testing, e.g. for foot-and-mouth disease, is the Commission obliged to use only the Pirbright Laboratory in Britain? In case of the need for a ‘second opinion’ can the Commission use another Laboratory, either within or without the EU? Does the Commission have a list of such laboratories and could this list be communicated to me please?
