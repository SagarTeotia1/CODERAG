WRITTEN QUESTION E-3962/07 by Catherine Stihler (PSE) to the Council (1 August 2007) Subject: Young people and alcohol Since the passing of Council Recommendation 2001/458/EC OJ L 16, 16.6.2001, p. 38. on the drinking of alcohol by young people, what progress has been made towards developing national alcohol strategies in Member States? The impact of binge drinking appears to have increased rather than diminished. For example, in the UK some pubs and night clubs offer entry for the evening on the basis of ‘pay GBP 10 and drink as much as you like’. Does the Council have any plans to address the issue?
