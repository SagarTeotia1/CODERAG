Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (4 September 2009) Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 3821/85 and (EC) No 2135/98 and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85, OJ L 102, 11.4.2006. on driving times and rest periods and Article 4(4) of its implementing Directive 2006/22/EC Directive 2006/22/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities and repealing Council Directive 88/599/EEC, OJ L 102, 11.4.2006. clearly provide for non-discrimination during the course of roadside checks. On the basis of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, the Commission publishes a report every two years concerning the application of the regulation, based upon the information provided by the Member States. The most recent report covers the period between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2006 and was adopted by the Commission on 3 August 2009 COM(2009)416 final. . The said report highlights among other things the Commission's that in some Member States attention needs to be paid to the respect of the non-discrimination principle when checking heavy goods vehicles. In order to improve the quality of the reporting and in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, the Commission has drawn up a standard reporting form for Member States Commission decision of 22 September 2008 drawing up the standard reporting form referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, COM(2008)5123 final. . With this form, detailed information on roadside checks will in future become available according to the country of registration of the vehicles checked. This will allow an in-depth verification of compliance with the non-discrimination requirement and is expected to prevent unfair vehicle checks in the future. The first detailed reports from Member States using the standard reporting form for the period 2007‑08 are due by 30 September 2009. In order to enhance road safety and in order to harmonise the specific requirements for cargo security throughout the European Union, the Commission has elaborated best practice guidelines on cargo securing and abnormal transport, which were published on 17 May 2006 and which are available at: http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/vehicles/guidelines_cargo_securing__en.htm
