the right of reply to inaccurate information disseminated through any type of medium which might harm their legitimate interests; (b) promote information media education programmes designed to enable parents, teachers and trainers to teach minors to make proper use of the information media; (c) avoid any discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and combat such discrimination. Your draftswoman proposes the following amendments in these areas: Amendments 8, 20 and 26 to develop a legal tool against discrimination; Amendments 9, 10, 11, 19 and 21 to develop media education and information programmes; Amendments 12, 17 and 22 to improve the possibilities of a right of reply or equivalent remedy for people who feel they have been harmed by inaccurate information; Amendments 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 24 to provide a precise demarcation of the scope of the recommendation, and Amendment 25 to create filters with a view to shielding minors from child pornography and other types of material which constitute an assault on human dignity. Nevertheless, your draftswoman takes the view that the protection of minors and respect for the principle of human dignity in the media and information services suffer from serious shortcomings at Community level, essentially for two reasons: (a) first, because it is paradoxical that the legal basis chosen in the EC Treaty to protect minors and guarantee respect for human dignity should be Article 157, which is geared to ensuring the competitiveness of European industry; (b) secondly, because the legal form chosen is a ‘recommendation’ whose mandatory content legally enforceable before the courts is practically zero. For this reason your draftswoman has inserted Amendments 1 to 6 and considers Article 153 of the EC Treaty, which refers to protecting the interests of consumers, to be more than sufficient as a legal basis for the Community to adopt a directive harmonising legislation in relation to all the media and electronic information services on protection for minors, respect for the principle of human dignity and a guaranteed right of reply or equivalent remedy against any inaccurate information disseminated through these media. AMENDMENTS The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls on the Committee on Culture and Education, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following amendments in its report: Text proposed by the Commission COM (2004)341, 30.4.2004 . Amendments by Parliament Amendment 1 Recital -1 (new) (-1) The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, incorporated into Part II of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , recognises under Article 1 the inviolability of human dignity, stating that it must be respected and protected. Article 24 of the Charter establishes that children have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being and that in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the child's best interests must be a primary consideration. Justification The legal basis used does not mention either dignity or the right to freedom of expression. Other existing provisions that refer to these two fundamental rights
