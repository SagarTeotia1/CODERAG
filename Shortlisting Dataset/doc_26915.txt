Believes it is important to strike an equitable balance between the eastern and southern neighbourhoods; calls on the Commission to accelerate the finalisation and implementation of Association Agreements, including DCFTAs; 21. Highlights the need to think of the ENP in terms of macro-regional strategy, with regional-level coordination of Union and Member State actions; at the Euro-Mediterranean level, a synergy could be ensured between such a strategy and the multilateral projects launched in the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean, such as the Mediterranean Solar Plan, civilian security, the ‘marine highways’ or the action to fight pollution in the Mediterranean; RESULT OF FINAL VOTE IN COMMITTEE Date adopted 20.10.2011 Result of final vote +: –: 0: 35 4 Members present for the final vote Jean-Pierre Audy, Zigmantas Balčytis, Ivo Belet, Bendt Bendtsen, Jan Březina, Pilar del Castillo Vera, Christian Ehler, Adam Gierek, Norbert Glante, Jacky Hénin, Edit Herczog, Romana Jordan Cizelj, Krišjānis Kariņš, Lena Kolarska-Bobińska, Béla Kovács, Philippe Lamberts, Bogdan Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, Judith A.

Considers that the territorial cooperation principles apply also to external borders and are a key tool to improve EU economic development as well as the EU’s overall ENP political goals, including the promotion of democracy; takes the view that these targets can only be achieved with the cooperation of both civil society and regional and local authorities, in order both to find practical ways of meeting citizens’ needs on the ground and to take into account the diversity of territorial situations within the ENP countries while promoting the principles of subsidiarity and multi-level governance; underlines that the Commission should extend its integrated approach in order to clearly support the local and regional authorities as one of the pillars of the ENP and guarantors of the general interest; 2. Considers that the ENP, in order to reduce the development gap and tensions between cross-border communities, should support practical projects by cross-border local and regional authorities towards sustainable mutual development, social and economic cohesion and a strong business regulatory framework, free of corruption; believes that cross-border local and regional authorities should learn to better coordinate and exchange their best practices in order to exploit shared development opportunities; 3. Stresses the high potential of European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs) involving regions beyond the external borders; encourages specific agreements with neighbouring third countries with regard to the introduction of national laws allowing
