Question for written answer E-009993/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Martin Callanan (ECR) (3 November 2011) Subject: Reducing the use of mercury batteries I understand that many European battery manufacturers have begun producing mercury-free batteries for use in a number of household items such as hearing aids, watches, etc. Does the Commission have any current plans to begin phasing out mercury batteries as part of the strategy to gradually reduce mercury use in the EU?
