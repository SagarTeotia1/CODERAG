ORAL QUESTION H-0249/05 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Ivo Belet to the Commission Subject: Preferential tariffs applied to imports from the areas hit by the tsunami Under the reformed Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), imports to the EU of, inter alia, textiles products from the Asian countries affected by the tsunami are to be subject to a zero rate of duty (provided that the countries concerned comply with the relevant environmental and employment criteria). Can the Commission indicate when what is known as the GSP Plus will actually enter into force and the level of the market share in excess of which the countries concerned will lose their entitlement to the zero rate? Instead of (provisionally) applying a zero rate, has the Commission any plans to apply an alternative preferential tariff to exports from the countries concerned? Does not the Commission feel that, by delaying the introduction of the projected GSP Plus, the EU is, in this way, undermining its own aid and development policy vis-à-vis the countries concerned and, actually, robbing Peter to pay Paul?
