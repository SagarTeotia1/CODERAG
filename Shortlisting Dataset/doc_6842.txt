Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (1 September 2011) Every generation of processors is faster, processes more data and consumes less energy. The Energy Star Programme for energy efficient office equipment rewards the introduction of new energy efficient technologies: The Energy Star appliance-specific label helps consumers to identify appliances that meet certain standards regarding energy efficiency. It is based on dynamic criteria. Alongside with public procurement measures, Energy Star thus supports indirectly the market uptake of new and improved processors. The European Commission's legislation does not promote any specific products or services.
