Question for written answer E-5971/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Christophe Béchu (PPE) (26 July 2010) Subject: Principles of insurance and precaution against risks associated with electromagnetic fields The ‘BioInitiative’ report of 31 August 2007, which was approved and published by the European Environment Agency and cited in Parliament’s resolution of 4 September 2008 Texts adopted of that date, P6_TA(2008)0410 . , found that electromagnetic networks as they are currently permitted to operate — i.e. with unregulated wireless emissions above the established 0.6 m/V threshold of social and health acceptability — are harmful to health. The problem relates not only to mobile phone networks but also to emissions from UMTS, WiFi, WiMAX and Blue Tooth. Given the risks to which people in Europe are exposed, why do the Council and the Belgian Presidency not do more to encourage prevention of this type of health danger in accordance with the ALARA (‘as low as reasonably achievable’) principle of precaution? Why, moreover, since 2003, have European reinsurance companies been excluding from cover risks associated with electromagnetic fields and other forms of radiation emitted by mobile phones and relay antennas: does this not suggest that the risk could be on a scale comparable to that of asbestos or lead in other contexts?
