WRITTEN QUESTION E-4504/07 by Werner Langen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (20 September 2007) Subject: Eligibility conditions for structural aid in 2007/2008 and assistance for the ‘bathing polder’ project in Norden-Norddeich, Germany An application in 2006 for assistance from the EU's Structural Fund was not fully processed, because the eligibility conditions for assistance for the 2007‑13 period were not yet known. The updated criteria for assistance under the Structural Fund have been published and a decision on the eligibility of the ‘bathing polder’ project in Norden-Norddeich may now be taken. The application for local infrastructure investment was submitted to the competent national authorities in Lower Saxony by the Wirtschaftsbetriebe der Stadt Norden GmbH. The building project involves the creation of a ‘bathing and surfing polder’ on the North Sea coast in Lower Saxony, the result of which will be a natural bathing area in the sea free of tides and chemical pollution. 1. When were the conditions for assistance and the level of structural funding for Lower Saxony set out, and what amounts have been made available for each year? 2. Does the Commission consider the funding of a building project of this kind to be possible and compatible with the conditions for assistance? 3. What specific conditions have to be met in East Frisia in order for EU funding to be granted?
