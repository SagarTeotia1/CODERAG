Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (22 January 2009) Pastor Omar Gude Peréz was arrested on 22 May 2008, charged with human trafficking and is waiting to be judged (no date confirmed at the moment). Mr Peréz has been a religious leader for 18 years in the Baptism Church, Evangelic Church and currently in charge of the ‘Apostolic Reform’ in Camagüey. Ms Kenya Denis, wife of Pastor Omar Peréz, has sent a letter of complaint to the Council of State following her husband's arrest. She has not directly contacted the European Union Embassies in Havana (EC included). The Commission cannot interfere in the Cuban legal system and its procedures which are still under way. Nevertheless, follow-up of the case will be ensured by means of regular contacts with Mr Gude's wife and could possibly be discussed within the Human Rights Working Group composed of the EC and Member States in Havana to follow human rights issues.
