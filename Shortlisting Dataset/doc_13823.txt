WRITTEN QUESTION E-3698/09 by Gabriela Creţu (PSE) to the Commission (19 May 2009) Subject: Addressing musculoskeletal disorders at work and beyond The Commission’s Work Programme for 2009 indicates that it intends to propose a directive on musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) at work. MSDs account for 50 % of all work‑related disorders and 60 % of permanent work incapacity in the European Union. Not all MSDs are caused by work, and they can also have negative social and economic impacts beyond the workplace if not appropriately addressed. 1. Will the proposal for a directive on musculoskeletal disorders at work be published before the end of the current Commission’s term of office? 2. Will the Commission acknowledge in its proposal: (a) the fact that job retention and supportive rehabilitation have positive benefits for most people living with MSDs — whether caused in the workplace or not — as long as job demands are adjusted; and (b) the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in keeping people living with MSDs at work, and thus in limiting the negative social and economic impact of MSDs across society? 3. Will the Commission recognise that MSDs have causes and substantial consequences beyond the workplace (e.g. rheumatic diseases that impact on families and careers), and that a broader EU‑level initiative addressing MSDs in general is needed in order to promote the ability to work and competitiveness?
