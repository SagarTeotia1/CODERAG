accession of new Member States. MEPs have also tabled amendments designed to ensure that the new scheme continues the fire prevention measures introduced by the previous regulation. Reference year for Kyoto Guido SACCONI (PES, I) Report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a monitoring mechanism of Community greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol ( COM(2003) 51 – C5-0031/2003 – 2003/0029(COD)) Doc.: A5-0290/2003 Procedure : Co-decision (1st reading) Debate : 20.10.2003 On behalf of the Environment Committee, Guido SACCONI (PES, I) is tabling a number of amendments at first reading to a proposal for a Parliament and Council decision on a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions. The committee wants to allow Member States to opt for 1990 rather than 1995 as the reference year for measuring emission reductions. Finland and France in particular would benefit by having their efforts to reduce emissions between 1990 and 1995 rewarded. However, the European Commission is opposing this, which could slow down the legislative procedure. The Commission has said that the Council might not lay down any year of reference at all if there is any questioning of the year 1995. The Commission argues that this would water down its proposal and place the Community in an uncomfortable position regarding other signatory states to the Kyoto protocol, as this protocol provides for mutual surveillance on the basis of reliable data. Train engines and barges to give off less pollution Bernd LANGE (PES, D) Report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery ( COM(2002) 765 – C5-0636/2002 – 2002/0304(COD)) Doc.: A5-0296/2003 Procedure : Co-decision (1st reading) Debate : 20.10.2003 Bernd LANGE (PES, D) is tabling a number of amendments on behalf of the Environment Committee widening the scope of a draft directive amending existing legislation on the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines on non-road mobile machinery (current Directive 97/68/EC). The amendments at first reading may well expand EU proposals to curb emissions of fumes from tractors, cranes and bulldozers to include rail stock (especially train engines) and boats on inland waterways, and seem to be acceptable to the Council. The committee is in favour of stricter emission limits to bring EU legislation into line with that of the United States. According to the rapporteur, emissions of NOx, a precursor of ozone, and carcinogenic particles from non-road mobile machinery can account for 40% of the total in some Member States, a proportion which is increasing as road transport is cleaned up. In addition, concentrations of harmful emissions can be extremely high in places where non-road machinery is used, for example on building sites. If stricter emission limits also cover barges and train engines, this will help EU goods transport policy, which seeks to promote rail and inland waterway rather than road transport. However, opponents of these
