services which are sometimes restricted to the national territory of a particular country and inaccessible for potential users from other Member States, have already been identified by the Commission in its Report on ‘The state of the Internal Market for services’ COM (2002) 441 final. , presented under the first stage of the Internal Market Strategy for Services. The 2002 Report was followed by the Commission proposal for a Directive on services in the internal market COM (2004) 2 final. at the beginning of 2004, which also aims at providing some additional solutions to cross-border problems with access to services raised by the Honourable Member. In this respect, as regards the accessibility of services provided by commercial service providers, Article 32 of the proposed Directive obliges the Member States to ensure that service providers supply certain basic contact information, for instance a postal address, fax number or e-mail address, to which all recipients of services, including those resident in another Member State, can send a complaint or a request for information on the service provided. In addition, as regards contacts with national authorities, Article 7 of the proposed Directive requires the Member States to ensure that the contact details of the competent authorities enabling them to be contacted directly, are easily accessible to service providers and recipients of services through the so called ‘single points of contact’.
