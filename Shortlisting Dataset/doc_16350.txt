2004/C 51 E/169 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1885/03 by Christopher Huhne (ELDR) to the Commission (6 June 2003) Subject: Transparency requirements In the Commission's proposal for a transparency directive, it states that it received 184 responses in the two consultation rounds. Will the Commission list all those investors and investor organisations that were consulted by it, and will it also attach to each organisation the amount of funds under management that it claims to speak for? Will it further arrange the list into those organisations that it believes were broadly favourable to compulsory quarterly reporting and those that were broadly against?
