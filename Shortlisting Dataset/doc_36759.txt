WRITTEN QUESTION E-5622/08 by Jörg Leichtfried (PSE) to the Commission (17 October 2008) Subject: Animal welfare: illegal transport of puppies Last Monday, the police in Austria stopped a vehicle which was transporting 137 puppies. The vehicle was very defective. Moreover, the animal passports had been forged, as the dogs had not yet reached the statutory minimum age for transportation. The journey had begun in Slovakia, with Spain as its intended destination. This is not an isolated case, and it once again reminds us that in Europe organisations exist which are bent on profit and which evade animal welfare provisions in a criminal manner. In Austria, a number of animal welfare activists were recently arrested under Article 278 of the Criminal Code. This article concerns involvement in a criminal organisation and is intended to provide protection against terrorist organisations. To me it is incomprehensible why the article has not been applied to the driver who was transporting the puppies — as a member of a presumed criminal organisation — and why he was not detained and remanded in custody pending an investigation on this basis. 1. Is the Commission aware how frequent illegal transportation is and that in many Member States vehicles transporting animals are not inspected adequately? 2. In view of the recurrent infringements, will the Commission introduce stringent, generally binding EU transport provisions, monitor carefully how Member States implement them and, if the law is not complied with, introduce appropriate penalties? 3. When will the Commission submit a proposal for a directive establishing universal European minimum standards for animal welfare which have to be implemented in all EU Member States?
