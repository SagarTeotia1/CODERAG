Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (18 March 2005) The Commission organises an exchange of information on the content of the Best Available Technique Reference Documents (BREF) between Member States and the industries concerned. This results in the publication of Best Available Techniques Reference Documents. In issuing permits, and as required by Annex IV of Directive 96/61/EC, the competent authorities must take account of the BREFs published by the Commission. The current draft of the BREF on waste treatment presents some information on a technology related to the thermo chemical conversion of asbestos waste. This technology uses a combination of chemical treatment and pyrolysis in order, in particular, to immobilise and reduce the volume of waste prior to landfill. At this stage, the technical working group has not indicated that it could draw up specific conclusions on best available techniques in the context of asbestos waste treatment. The treatment or disposal of asbestos waste is not specifically addressed in the BREF on waste incineration. The exchange of information on best available techniques is still on-going for the waste treatment and waste incineration sectors and should be finalised by the end of 2005.
