in terms of timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, accountability and sustainability. In countries fulfilling the eligibility criteria for budget support, the Vulnerability Flex support shall be provided preferably in the form of an addition to an existing budget support programme (preferably general but it can also be a sector budget support if there is no ongoing general budget support). However, in countries which are not immediately eligible for budget support but where a commitment to a stability-oriented macroeconomic policy framework has been demonstrated., the Vulnerability Flex can be delivered through existing projects or programmes in support of measures to mitigate the social consequences of the crisis, including social safety nets, employment creating initiatives and actions aimed at maintaining social service provision. In 2009, a first tranche of around EUR 236 million has been allocated to 15 ACP countries. The remaining amount available for 2010 is therefore around EUR 264 million. The deadline for receiving the 2010 V-FLEX requests submitted by ACP States was 15 March 2010. 36 requests have been received for a total amount of EUR 526 million and the concerned technical services of the Commission are currently proceeding to the first assessment of their eligibility.
