ORAL QUESTION H-0443/04 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Hélène Goudin to the Commission Subject: The EU's aid policy Over the years, the EU's aid policy has been associated with fraud problems and has moreover been criticised for favouring national special interests within the EU. This has seriously damaged the policy's credibility. Are further measures by the Commission needed in order to prevent fresh fraud scandals in the field of aid? Does the Commission recognise that the EU's aid policy is to a large extent geared to national special interests?
