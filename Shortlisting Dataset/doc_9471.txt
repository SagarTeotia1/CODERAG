Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (30 March 2011) Member States have a duty to ensure that fuel marketed in their territory complies with the quality requirements set out in the Fuel Quality Directive Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels . This directive prescribes, inter alia , the maximum sulphur content of petrol as 10 mg/kg. In addition, Member States are required to determine the applicable penalties for breaches of national legislation adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Fuel Quality Directive. Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The Commission will inform the Portuguese authorities of the concerns raised and request further information on this matter.
