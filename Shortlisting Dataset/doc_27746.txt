Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (16 August 2007) Community secondary legislation in this area requires that the manufacturer provides instructions for use to ensure safe installation, operation and maintenance of the TV set. In case of non-compliance with this obligation, the relevant national implementing provisions and the related enforcement procedures can therefore be relied on by any interested party. However, the instructions for use are very different from the technical file which sets out the technical solution(s) applied by the manufacturer to design and build the product. For example this will include design and manufacturing drawings and layouts of components, sub-assemblies, circuits, etc. If it is these documents that are being requested, then it is not foreseen by Community law that they are to be made available on request by other parties aside from the Member States for market surveillance purposes. This is of course without prejudice to the contractual arrangements between the parties. The EC Competition rules forbid certain types of unilateral conduct only when undertaken by companies which enjoy a dominant position on a relevant market. Furthermore, whether or not they are dominant, firms have a right to freely choose their training partners and to dispose freely of their property. Refusal to supply can therefore be considered as an abuse under EC competition law only in very limited circumstances. In particular, for the firm's conduct to constitute an abuse, it must be clear that it will result in anticompetitive foreclosure on the market and that it may lead to long lasting customer harm.
