WRITTEN QUESTION P-4969/08 by Giovanna Corda (PSE) to the Commission (15 September 2008) Subject: Rise in food prices The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food has made specific suggestions with a view to limiting in future, as far as possible, wide and sometimes speculative fluctuations in the price of food and their disastrous consequences for the poorest populations. One of these proposals is to set up a ‘world food bank’ that would function as a food reserve for the world and could be managed by an international organisation. In view of the importance of the question of food stocks to prevent price volatility, has the Commission already considered this proposal and, if so, what is its position on this matter? Given the extreme urgency of the world food crisis, does the Commission envisage other measures to limit in future the worst consequences of price fluctuations, particularly those of a speculative nature?
