(Zaki Laïdi). Furthermore, Europe’s competitiveness is far from disastrous. A careful analysis carried out by the Commission’s Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) shows that, over the last few years, two thirds of US productivity growth was accounted for by the services sector, and in particular the wholesale and retail trades, the property sector and the financial intermediary sector. In those sectors, there is no direct competition between Americans and Europeans. According to the same study, Europe out-performed the United States in the primary and secondary sectors. It matched or surpassed the Americans in 37 of the 56 sectors studied. On the other hand, the US has an unchallenged lead in the semiconductors and office equipment sectors, whereas labour productivity was higher in Europe than in the US in the communications and IT services sectors (Economic Papers, No 221 - 02/05). Basically, Europe lags behind only in certain high-tech sectors: ICT, biotechnology including pharmaceuticals, and of course GMO. 9. In fact the main area where Europe is at a serious disadvantage is research, although some Nordic countries out-perform the US in this field too. The US spends 2.8% of its GDP on research and development, whereas Europe only spends 1.9% of GDP. In absolute terms, the US spends around US $ 110 billion per year more than Europeans, in other words the equivalent of the EU budget. It is Europe’s industrial sector which lags furthest behind. 80.5% of the US’s 1.3 million research scientists work for the private sector, whereas only 48% of 1.08 million researchers in EU-25 work in the private sector. 10. The integrated guidelines will have to be fine-tuned in the course of the next three-year period. In principle at least, the euro area currently has a favourable macroeconomic framework (low inflation, strong currency, low interest rates). However, the three members of EU-15 which are outside the euro area have a higher rate of growth, even though the price they pay for their currency independence is higher short-term and long-term interest rates. Eight of the ten new member countries enjoy substantial growth, despite their other structural problems. The integrated guidelines must take the diversity of the Member States’ respective situations and problems into account to a greater extent. Pending the communication we have been promised setting out certain information to assist the Member States to draw up their national synthetic reports, the present report confines itself to topical proposals.
