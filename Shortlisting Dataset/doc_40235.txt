non-state actors (NSAs) and local authorities (LAs) on the programming, implementation and evaluation of strategy papers; emphasises therefore the need to take the conclusions of the Structured Dialogue into account in future financial instruments; 25. Stresses the need for flexibility provisions which allow the EU to respond to changes in terms of needs and priorities; suggests an examination of the EDF model of limited country envelopes of non-programmed aid as a possible model for the future development cooperation instrument; stresses, however, that funds used in a more flexible manner must pursue genuine development objectives; 26. Considers that the new development cooperation instrument should provide a basis for targeted and more flexible aid to situations of fragility; believes that the new financial architecture should help to ensure proper linkage of relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD) through flexibility and complementarity of the funding mechanisms; Perspectives for the future: geographic and thematic programmes 27. Calls for a benchmark of 20% of spending under geographic programmes to be allocated to basic social services as defined by the United Nations in the MDGs (indicator 8.2 for goal 8: ‘Develop a global partnership for development’); 28. Insists on strict eligibility criteria for budget support; insists that the Commission must refrain from using budget support in countries where transparency in public spending cannot be assured, that budget support must always be accompanied by actions to develop the receiving country’s parliamentary control and audit capacities and to increase transparency and public access to information, and that civil society should be involved in monitoring budget support; 29. Recognises the important roles that civil society plays in development, such as acting as a watchdog in relation to government to ensure accountability, and calls for adequate funding to be directed towards civil society in developing countries; 30. Repeats its call for the Commission to produce a comprehensive financial analysis covering general budget support, support by sector, support by project and support of any other kind granted to local government; stresses that having this global picture would make support granted to local government more consistent and improve governance in partner countries; 31. Notes that all thematic programmes under the DCI have proven their relevance, and emphasises that it is imperative to maintain both thematic and geographic programmes, but calls for some refocusing in the light of new challenges, such as the global financial and economic crisis, the global food crisis, climate change and special needs of fragile states and states in transition; 32. Points out that migration is an area in which there is a clear need to prioritise policy coherence for development over short-term EU migration considerations, mostly aimed at fighting illegal immigration; highlights that development funds for migration should not be used for strengthening border management and combating illegal immigration; insists that any future thematic programme on migration must be fully aligned with the EU’s development objectives and that the core funding under this programme must fulfil the ODA eligibility criteria; in particular, stresses that projects dealing with South-South migration should be given priority within the thematic programme; 33. Stresses that a
