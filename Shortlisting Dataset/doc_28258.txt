WRITTEN QUESTION E-0380/05 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (8 February 2005) Subject: Trials in Syria The Syrian regime has followed up the tragic murder of two Assyrian-Chaldean-Syrians in Al Hassakeh on 16 October 2004 by repressing the ethnic group concerned. The murders took place on the street in Hassakeh. An Arab mob assisted by an intelligence officer defiled the dead by dragging one of the corpses through central Hassakeh for public display. When a group of two thousand Assyrian-Chaldean-Syrians marched on the Governor's residence in protest at the murders and the authorities' shielding of the perpetrators, the Governor set troops and police on the demonstrators and the demonstration was brutally broken up. The following day, some 40 Assyrians were arbitrarily arrested throughout Hassakeh. Some of those seized were not even in the town at the time the demonstration took place. Most were severely tortured and were forced to confess to crimes which they had not committed. The Syrian regime has shown that it wants to intimidate ethnic Assyrian-Chaldean-Syrians as a whole in Syria. Representatives of the Assyrian-Chaldean-Syrians who have become involved in this case have been summoned to interrogation and subjected to persecution because of their involvement. Some 19 individuals are still deprived of their freedom and will appear before a military court in Aleppo in early February 2005 to answer charges of committing acts and crimes against the security of the Syrian State. Four minors have been released, though they have been charged. The EU is currently negotiating with Syria over extensive investment in that country and trade in exchange for improvements in human rights. Is the Commission monitoring the trials of these Assyrian-Chaldean-Syrians, and what measures will the Commission take if the situation in Syria does not improve?
