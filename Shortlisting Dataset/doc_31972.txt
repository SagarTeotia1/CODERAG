WRITTEN QUESTION E-0103/09 by Satu Hassi (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (19 January 2009) Subject: Consumer protection in connection with compact fluorescent lamps The EU has decided to eliminate energy-wasting incandescent light bulbs, a decision which I welcome. In the next few years, the most relevant more energy-efficient option in most cases will be the compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), sales of which will grow substantially once the ban on the sale of incandescent light bulbs enters into force. However, there are two consumer protection problems with the CFLs currently on the market. Firstly, there is a tendency for the information provided on the packaging to exaggerate the power of the incandescent bulb which a CFL replaces. For example, it is claimed that an 11-watt CFL replaces a 60-watt incandescent bulb, whereas in reality a 12- or 15-watt CFL is generally required for this purpose. This problem could be solved by making it compulsory for the packagings of all light bulbs on sale to indicate luminescence in terms of lux rather than incandescent light bulb wattage equivalence. Secondly, the real life of a CFL is often shorter than the promised 5 000 hours. This problem could be solved by requiring a minimum guaranteed life to be indicated on every type of bulb, a replacement bulb of the same power rating being provided if a lamp ceased to work before the end of its guaranteed life. Is the Commission aware of these consumer protection problems associated with CFLs, and does it intend to take measures to solve them — either the measures I have proposed or alternative measures?
