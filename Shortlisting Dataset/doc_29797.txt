should be a key priority of a 2020 strategy; calls, therefore, for a new legislative agenda to strengthen workers’ rights and working conditions, including a revision of the posting of workers directive and new or revised directives on minimum income schemes, working time, abusive individual dismissals, information and consultation, union recognition, cross-border collective agreements, equal treatment of a-typical workers, equal pay, and labour inspections; calls on the Commission to change its practice of considering this area only as being subject to Commission communications, and to propose flagship legislative initiatives to protect workers’ rights as a matter of urgency; insists in this respect on the need to tackle youth unemployment; 12. Notes that the European Council reaffirms the EU commitment agreed in December 2008 to deliver by 2020 a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% increase in energy consumption supplied from renewable energy sources, and a 20% reduction in energy consumption thanks to energy efficiency; urges the Commission to propose legislation to increase emission reduction targets to 30% and beyond; and to propose policies to ensure a profound change in production, distribution and consumption towards true sustainability, with new opportunities for growth and new green jobs; reiterates that this transition will require a massive and rapid transformation of European industry through a European sustainable industrial policy; as well as measures to help workers’ transition towards a new environmentally sustainable economy; 13. Reminds the Commission that European citizens expect the Union to push for a cleaner, safer and healthier society; calls on the Commission to continue to apply the ‘polluter pays’ and ‘precautionary’ principles in legislation, which are key elements to a successful sustainable economic recovery; is disappointed with progress made on the sustainable development strategy to date; calls on the Commission to propose a new, tough biodiversity strategy with targets to protect natural habitats and ecosystems; and regrets that action on health prevention and health inequalities is not higher in the 2020 list of priorities; 14. Regrets the lack of any ambition to develop a truly common European energy policy in the EU 2020 strategy; stresses that although a functioning internal market is a key goal for Europe and while stressing the need to rapidly implement the 3rd energy package, overemphasising this part of the Europe’s energy policy has come at the detriment of the other two objectives of ‘sustainable development’ and ‘security-of-supply’; recalls that the internal market cannot be dealt with separately from the external dimension, and that Europe needs a truly Common European Energy policy in order to have a real effect on security of energy supply, climate change and affordability of energy; calls on the Commission to start developing a European Energy Community with full responsibility for all aspects of energy policy; bears in mind that regarding the energy mix each Member State should assume its own responsibilities , according to its resources and its climatic , hydraulic , geological and geographical conditions , but as part of a common European strategy ; 15. Stresses the need to use the current economic crisis for a shift towards a
