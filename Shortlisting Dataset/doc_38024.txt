Considers that Parliament cannot accept the move to reduce the legislative powers and the participation in the legislative process of the one institution to be directly elected by European citizens; enhancing communication between citizens and the institutions of the Union necessarily entails strengthening Parliament's legislative powers, giving more time in which to use them and extending the realm of Community legislation in order to achieve effective harmonisation of the diverse range of national legal systems; 10. Therefore attaches particular importance to the following considerations of principle being taken into account in the further debate on governance: (a) governance by the Union institutions requires democratic legitimacy; this is provided jointly by the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States, the latter as the bodies exercising democratic scrutiny over governments acting in the Council; (b) democratic legitimacy presupposes that the political will underpinning decisions is arrived at through parliamentary deliberation ; this is a substantive and not merely a formal requirement; there is also an urgent need for democratic legitimacy and scrutiny when implementing rules are adopted by the executive; (c) legitimacy is understood to mean that political decisions must be underpinned by a fundamental consensus, such as that expressed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights recognised by the European Union - in the sense of a list of individual rights and an objective value system; (d) legitimacy in this sense is ultimately inconceivable without clear attribution of political responsibility and cannot be replaced by 'technical' factors such as ‘effectiveness’ or ‘coherence’ Participation and consultation 11. Points out, on the basis of these considerations, with regard to participation and consultation that (a) in terms of the criteria referred to in paragraphs 8 and 10 above, 'organised civil society' as 'the sum of all organisational structures whose members have objectives and responsibilities that are of general interest and who also act as mediators between the public authorities and citizens' Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee on the role and contribution of civil society organisations in the building of Europe, 22.9.1999, paragraph 7.1, OJ C 329, 17. 11. 1999, p. 339. , whilst important, are inevitably sectoral and cannot be regarded as having its own democratic legitimacy See also paragraph 30 of Parliament's resolution of 26.10.2000 (see 7th citation Wuermeling report). , given that representatives are not elected by the people and therefore cannot be voted out by the people, (b) consultation of interested parties with the aim of improving draft legislation can only ever supplement and can never replace the procedures and decisions of legislative bodies which possess democratic legitimacy; only the Council and Parliament, as co-legislators, can take responsible decisions in the context of legislative procedures, due account being taken of the opinions of the bodies specified in the Treaties, i.e. in particular the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, (c) an important mouthpiece for civil society is, by definition and in accordance with its newly formulated role under Article 257 as amended by the Treaty of Nice, the Economic and Social Committee, which has advisory status
