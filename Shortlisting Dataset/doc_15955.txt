Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2011) The Commission is carrying out the evaluation pursuant to Article 14 of the Data Retention Directive, taking account of the considerations and points of view of all stakeholders. It will continue this approach throughout the review of the directive. The Honourable Member refers to the Member of the Commission responsible for Home Affairs' statement at a conference of 3 December 2010 that the Commission intends to maintain the directive. This statement should not be interpreted as pre-empting the outcome of the evaluation and review, but merely as an acknowledgement of the fact that data retention continues to be an instrument that law enforcement requires to avail of in order to address serious forms of crime. The conference at which the statement was made was a part of the evaluation process. The views expressed at the conference and the conclusions drawn from it will be reflected in the evaluation report which the Commission is finalising for publication in the coming months. That report will also reflect the arguments in favour and against data retention, as well as the position that the Commission will take in that context. The Commission remains committed to an EU approach to data retention which is limited to what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society and which includes the appropriate safeguards for protection of privacy.
