Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (17 July 2009) The Commission is neither aware of the project mentioned, REMO, nor of any relevant information disseminated by the responsible company for this project, Red Eléctrica (REE). The competent authorities have already issued the authorisation (Environment Impact Statement or EIS) for this project that contains measures to ensure the protection of the affected Natura 2000 sites and the coherence of the Natura 2000 network. It is the responsibility of the developer to fully implement these measures as set out in the authorisation and in accordance with the provisions of the Habitats Directive Council Directive 92/43/EC, of 21 May 1992, on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora. OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . The fact that the company is disseminating information about projects and activities which are related to Natura 2000 sites and are not part of the obligations stated in the EIS that REE must fulfil is an issue that does not fall under the competence of the Commission.
