WRITTEN QUESTION E-0864/07 by Antonios Trakatellis (PPE‑DE) to the Council (23 February 2007) Subject: Deceiving the public with supposed miracle cures and how to stop such abuses Recently there have been widespread reports in Greece and throughout the world (CNN, BBC, Deutsche Welle) on the non-proven benefits of olive leaves in the treatment of cancer. As this kind of rumour circulates from time to time in various countries, can the Council say: 1. whether it considers it disastrous if medically prescribed cancer treatment is abandoned and patients are duped into seeking salvation in miracle cures, thus losing precious time during the scientifically based treatment they are supposed to follow; 2. whether this is tantamount to misleading advertising in breach of Directive 97/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Commission of 6 October 1997 amending Directive 84/450/EEC concerning misleading advertising so as to include comparative advertising OJ No L 290, 23.10.1997, p. 18 . ; and 3. whether it plans to put an end to such situations, which have an enormous impact on public health, by drawing up a recommendation to the Member States so they can find the means to stop the deception — by the media or others — of promoting supposed miracle cures that are likely to cause patients further harm because of their contents?
