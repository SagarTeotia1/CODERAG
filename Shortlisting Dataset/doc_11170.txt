WRITTEN QUESTION P-3771/06 by Stefano Zappalà (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (4 September 2006) Subject: Prodi Commission; events between 1999 and 2004; Nomisma Institute On 27 February 2006 I tabled Written Question P‑0848/06, which was answered on 7 April 2006 (P‑0848/06EN) and 7 August 2006. In the light of its replies, can the Commission answer the following questions: — Did Mr Paolo De Castro perform any role within the Commission, directly or indirectly, between 1999 and 2004 and, if so, what office or directorate did he assist? — Were further payments made after the end of the above period for tasks previously assigned to the Nomisma company, whether as a sole contractor or as a member of a consortium? — Given that the reply of 7 April 2006 refers, in the third paragraph, to the principle of ‘transparency’, should not the Commission ascertain whether Mr Prodi was in any way linked to Nomisma, notwithstanding the fact that he did not mention that company in his declaration of financial interests? — For the same reason, if it proved to be the case that Mr De Castro did work for the Commission until 31 December 2000 and has been president of Nomisma since 1 January 2001, would it not also be necessary to ascertain whether the Commission knowingly transgressed the principle of transparency or was misled and then do what the law required?
