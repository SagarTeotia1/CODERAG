WRITTEN QUESTION E-1552/04 by Christopher Huhne (ALDE) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Trade figures Can the Commission outline its methods for calculating the import and export trade figures to and from each Member State? When calculating the trade between countries does the Commission always calculate and record trade figures according to end destination or does it include/use ‘transit’ countries? This in context of some British exports going via Rotterdam and Antwerp before heading to their final end destination. Is the Commission aware of the so-called ‘Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect’? What steps does the Commission take to ensure that trade figures are not distorted by this ‘effect’?
