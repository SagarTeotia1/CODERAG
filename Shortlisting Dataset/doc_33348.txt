WRITTEN QUESTION E-1036/10 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (26 February 2010) Subject: Economic support measures for Greek and European farmers The Commission is aware that the economic crisis led to a very sharp decline — 12.2 % — in farmers’ incomes in 2009. Greek farmers are in a particularly bleak position since, according to Eurostat statistics, their incomes are the third lowest in EU countries, having fallen by 19.7 % between 2001 and 2008. Furthermore, in 2008 Greek farmers’ incomes fell by 7.9 %. As a result, in 2006 and 2007 the number of those employed in agricultural production fell by 40 000. The wretched economic situation of Greek farmers has, as the Commission is aware, led to the sustained mobilisation of farmers demanding income support measures. Given that: (a) Greece is under Community budgetary supervision owing to its excessive deficit, which means that, in practice, the Commission does not allow it to avail itself of the opportunity which it has given to other Member States to support their farmers, whose incomes have fallen by up to EUR 15 000 over the two-year period, (b) for the third consecutive season Greek farmers are selling their produce below production costs: It appears that a special European economic programme needed to support European agriculture, especially in countries which, owing to the excessive deficit, cannot use the de minimum regulation. In view of the above, will the Commission say whether it intends to adopt a special European economic programme of direct aid to Greek farmers who have been severely affected by the economic crisis or even to approve the possibility of economic support from ‘stalled’ NSRF funding?
