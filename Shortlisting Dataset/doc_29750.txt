a) the clear need to market the products through short distribution channels, b) the still high prices of the final products, c) conformity with environmental and health regulations that must also be complied with by smallholders and SMEs involved in processing, d) extending organic production to other specific sectors such as stockbreeding and viticulture, are all aspects which require special handling at a regulatory and financial level, on a different basis from traditional production, H. whereas there is great variation in the support given by Member States to the development of organic farming, and whereas the disparities between them must be reduced in the framework of a European action programme to promote organic farming, I. whereas possible contamination by GM crops is of particular importance in the context of organic farming, particularly as regards the measures to be taken to regulate the coexistence of transgenic and organic crops, Development of the organic food market and development of standards (Actions 1-3) 1. Welcomes the fact that the Commission recognises that organic farming plays an important part in the objectives of the new CAP, as defined in the Luxembourg Agreement of June 2003; notes that it does not consider it necessary to provide human or financial resources in the context of the European Union budget; welcomes the demand-based approach chosen by the Commission to stimulate organic farming; 2. Takes the view that: (a) the measures to support information and promotion campaigns are useful if they take account of the experience of the industry’s professional associations and the Member States’ legislation and programmes. Producer groups and cooperatives should play a particular role in the rational management of the production and marketing of organic products and food. They can also contribute towards achieving quality production and to processing and marketing through direct distribution or commercial chains, thereby securing added value for the producers themselves; (b) the Commission should base its promotion measures on an analysis of the markets and of the consequences of the process of concentrating trade in organic products, paying particular attention to retailing and distribution; (c) consumer information campaigns, particularly for children and young people, should be intensified and combined with awareness programmes concerning the environmental and nutritional value of organic products. Promotion campaigns should focus on public canteens, with particular reference to school canteens. The promotion of organic products should be strengthened under the relevant Community programmes within and outside the European Union; (d) in all promotion activities mentioned in Action 1, the Commission should specify and promote to the same level the environmental advantages of organic agriculture and the advantages that this type of product offers for human health, (e) small producers and SMEs working in the food industry should be the main beneficiaries of these measures, particularly as they are part of regional, multi-partner structures; (f) the development of an internal market in organic food and non-food products will lead to the standardisation of their production methods, whilst naturally taking account of their particular features and traditional regional methods of production, will establish uniform controls and national bodies for the
