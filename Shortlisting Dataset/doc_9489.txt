Answer given by Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (15 March 2010) The Commission launched at the end of 2009 an external study to provide the Commission with a critical analysis of the financial instruments which currently support Member States action in the field of disaster prevention. To this end, the study report will aim, in particular, at providing the Commission with: — an inventory of existing EU financial instruments capable of supporting disaster prevention activities; — the development of a catalogue of prevention measures that could be considered by Member States for EU funding. The six-month study report is due to be completed by the end of June 2010. The comprehensive inventory should aim at assessing the scope of existing instruments, their degree of use at European level and by Member States. An assessment of the effectiveness of existing instruments will be conducted with a view to assessing the consistency between the objectives of the funds and the results achieved, identifying the gaps in their coverage, and assessing their impact. The study will also analyse potential improvements to the instruments. Finally, recommendations on how to better share information on existing instruments supporting disaster prevention will be included in the report. The catalogue, presented as a user-friendly tool, will help users to find all necessary information when looking for a financial instrument to implement a prevention measure they would have previously identified. On this basis, as requested by the Council conclusions on a Community framework on disaster prevention within the EU 15394/09, 30 November 2009. , the Commission will assess the possibility of further integrating disaster prevention into existing funding.
