Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (22 August 2007) The Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries has informed the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (letter No 10856 of 18 April 2007) that the Institute for Funding Agriculture and Fisheries (IFAP) has taken over the functions of National Institute for Intervention and Agricultural Guarantee (INGA) and the Institute for Funding and Supporting the Development of Agricultural and Fisheries (IFADAP) and has been designated as Paying Agency responsible for the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) expenditure. In accordance with Article 17 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD, OJ L 171, 23.6.2006. containing transitional provisions, further accreditation will be provided by 16 October 2007. According to the Portuguese authorities IFAP has taken over the roles of INGA and IFADAP purely for organisational reasons and assumes the same responsibilities. Under shared management and in compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, OJ L 209, 11.8.2005. and its implementing rules, the Member State's competent authority is responsible for ensuring that the accreditation criteria are respected. The Commission will audit IFAP's compliance with these criteria in due course. Finally, IFAP cannot incur EAFRD expenditure until the 2007‑13 rural development plan has been approved by the Commission. This is unlikely to take place before 16 October 2007.
