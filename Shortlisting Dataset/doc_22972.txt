Question for written answer E-005030/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) (20 May 2011) Subject: Support for reforestation and prevention of forest fires On a recent visit to the forest areas of the Alto Minho, including Soajo, in Portugal, I was made aware of the consequences of the severe forest fires which have affected the region in recent years. In many cases the burnt areas have not been completely rehabilitated and there has been no replanting. There are therefore new threats to numerous forest ecosystems, among them the spread of invasive exotic species and pests and a lack of preventive measures against further fires. It is thus essential to channel sufficient financial resources via Community programmes and support measures, in order to evaluate the ecological and phytosanitary state of these forests and ensure their rehabilitation (including replanting), giving preference to local species and mixed forests in the interests of resilience and biodiversity. Can the Commission state: 1. what measures have been taken to date to support those, including farmers, who have suffered from forest fires in Portugal in the last two years; 2. whether measures are proposed to support the prevention of forest fires such as forest clean-ups, surveillance or the creation of logistic teams; 3. what forms of support exist for reforestation with local species?
