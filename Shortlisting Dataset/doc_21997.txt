WRITTEN QUESTION E-3271/09 by Maria Badia i Cutchet (PSE) to the Commission (5 May 2009) Subject: Possible enlargement of the eurozone On 6 April 2009 the International Monetary Fund said that the EU Member States in central and eastern Europe should consider the possibility of replacing their respective national currencies with the euro. It raised the possibility of creating a status of quasi-member for those countries, without a seat in the European Central Bank Council, which would imply a weakening of the rules of admission for the eurozone. Does the European Commission consider the possibility of creating the status of quasi-member of the eurozone a viable one? What repercussions would this new situation have for the Member States already part of the eurozone? How does the Commission believe adapting to the euro would help the monetary stability and domestic growth strategy of these Member States?
