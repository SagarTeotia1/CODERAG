Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (20 November 2007) The Commission has initially concentrated its efforts on voluntary Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) partnership agreements in regions with a greater volume of forest trade with the EU than South America, namely Africa and South-East Asia. Some countries in South America, such as Brazil, have increased domestic efforts to control illegal logging, but have stated that they do not wish to link such activities to trade in forest products with the EU. The Commission will continue to raise the issue both in bilateral contacts and in relevant international fora and funds a number of projects in countries of the region which contribute to the FLEGT action plan objectives. Amongst these projects the Commission would highlight the support provided, through a grant to the World Bank, to the work of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organisation in coordinating regional work on forest law enforcement and governance. The Government of Ecuador has recently expressed an interest in a FLEGT voluntary partnership and the Commission intends to build on this interest through a visit of officials in the coming months.
