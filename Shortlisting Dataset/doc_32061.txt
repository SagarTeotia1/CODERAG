ORAL QUESTION H-0013/05 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Michl Ebner to the Commission Subject: Definition of mountain areas and mountain forests Article 18 of Regulation (EC) 1257/99 provides a definition of mountain areas with a view to their receiving aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) under the heading of support for rural development. However, since that definition is not sufficiently comprehensive, calls have been made for many years now for mountain areas to be redefined. In September 2002, I was informed that a revision would be carried out. Since then, however, nothing has changed. Can the Commission indicate when the revision of the definition of mountain areas and mountain forests will be carried out and published? OJ L 302, 1.12.2000, p. 72.
