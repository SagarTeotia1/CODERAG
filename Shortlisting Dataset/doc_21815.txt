Question for written answer E-9630/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (23 November 2010) Subject: Can Soleret youth hostel, Mataró The Regional Planning and Public Works Department of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia plans to construct a new section of the C-31 motorway to run parallel to the existing C-32. The Spanish Government Ministry for Public Works is financing this project with money earmarked to replace the N-II. The plan for constructing this parallel stretch of road includes the demolition of Albergue Municipal Can Soleret, a youth hostel in the city of Mataró. This old 19th-century farmhouse was renovated during the 1990s as a venue for any kind of stay based on leisure, education, culture and discovering the world around us. The renovation was carried out by a workshop which organises training programmes funded by the EU. Does the Commission intend to take any action to prevent the demolition of a building that was part financed by the EU? Does the Commission think that demolishing this building is in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility for Community funds?
