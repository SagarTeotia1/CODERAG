debt relief or balance of payments urgencies and specific projects that are associated with the energy sector. However, the transition to a market economy has not been easy. Ukraine in recent years has been in a stagflation. GDP at constant prices has fallen as follows: in 1996 by -10%, in 1997 by –3%, in 1998 by –1.7% and in 1999 by –3%. On the other hand, consumer prices increased by 39.7% in 1996, 10% in 1997, 22% in 1998 and 21% in 1999. 2. The justification for the delay in disbursing the second part of the €92 million of the 1998 Decision is hollow, not even stated in the Commission’s memorandum. A hint to understanding the delay of disbursing the second part is given by the Commission: “All this [negative macro-economic developments in 2002-2001] led Ukraine to stop servicing its debts to the Paris Club in January 2000. That same month, Moody's downgraded Ukraine to a default grade rating (from B3 to Caa1) and, in April 2000, Ukraine had to reschedule some its foreign debts to the private sector”. (Memorandum, p.4) In other words, during a critical period in which Ukraine experienced high inflation, government deficit, current account deficit, balance of payments problems, disappointing inward FDI and depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the Commission in consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee – a consultative organ to the ECOFIN Council – decided not to be helpful to the Ukraine’s economic needs. 3. The new proposal entails features of the loan facility, which need mention and further clarification as to its handling by the Commission. Firstly, the macro-economic assistance takes the form of a loan of €110 million, which will have a maximum maturity period of 15 years and a grace period of 10 years. Secondly, there should be additional provisioning of the Guarantee Fund for some €1.62 million in the EC budget. This feature is further developed in the letter from the Budget Committee attached to this report. Thirdly, a concealed conditionality clause is attached. That is to say that the two or even more instalments of the new loan of up to €110 million (of which €92 million are the undisbursed funds from the1998 loan operation and only €18 million is additional) would depend on two conditions; the first has to do with the implementation by Ukraine of the adjustment and reform programme agreed with the IMF, and the second condition is linked to the structural reform measures to be agreed between the Commission and Ukraine. 4. All in all, and given the context this supplementary EC loan to Ukraine is given, the rapporteur supports the proposal in question.
