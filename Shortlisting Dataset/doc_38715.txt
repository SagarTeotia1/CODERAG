Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2006) The initiative by McDonalds to distribute a McPassport to its 225 000 staff in the Member States takes place in the context of the 2006 European Year of Workers' Mobility. As in previous European Years, the Commission has encouraged all relevant stakeholders — local and regional authorities, businesses, academia, training associations, social partner organisations- to organise awareness-raising events and develop innovative proposals in order to enhance geographic and job-to-job mobility within the EU. The project developed by McDonalds has attracted the Commission's attention, because of its scale and focus — the passport represents a simple and visible manner to record and facilitate mobility experiences in establishments of the company in another European Economic Area (EEA) country. It is in this context that the Commission has welcomed the idea, which could easily be reproduced within other companies. This acknowledgement does not imply any official endorsement of the project, nor has the Commission provided any financial support for the project in question.
