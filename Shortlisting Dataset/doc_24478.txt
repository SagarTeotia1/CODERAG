to establish a policy to tax companies, interests and financial assets according to their higher economic efficiency and ability to pay. Furthermore, coordinated action on ecological taxation should be pursued, thus supporting energy and resource saving strategies, ecological innovation and the development of eco-efficient services. This could enable Member States to finance the ecological conversion of infrastructure. Finally, in addition to macro-economic policies, much more focus should be placed on the local and regional mobilisation of resources for sustainable development. Regional development pacts, local action plans for employment and local centres for job creation projects are elements of a complementary bottom-up strategy to combat the prospect of recession. Taken together, such policies and the resulting increased capacities of Member States for public spending and investment contribute to stabilising and increasing employment and to modernising our economies with a view to sustainable development. CONCLUSIONS The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following points in its motion for a resolution: 1. Recognises that the current simultaneous economic stagnation in the industrialised countries may seriously hamper EU economic performance and employment in the short to medium term, that the EU response of “policy-as-usual” is consequently insufficient and that there is an urgent need to strike a balance between coherence, coordination and synchronisation between the social and economic dimension in the context of the Lisbon process; 2. Calls on the Member States to strengthen public and private investment in ecological conversion of infrastructures, in education, training and lifelong learning and social infrastructure in order to stabilise employment and enhance job creation; 3. Is concerned about the failure of the Barcelona Summit to develop an integrated European Sustainability Strategy as envisaged; expect that economic policy will support the goals of full employment with improved quality of work, social inclusion and sustainable development, as a first element to launch the European Sustainability Strategy; reiterates and endorses the Barcelona European Council’s conclusions that "full employment in the European Union is the core of the Lisbon strategy and the essential goal of economic and social policies, which requires the creation of more and better jobs" ; considers, therefore, that the Employment and Social Affairs Council should be involved more closely in the establishment of the BEPG, so that a better balance is created between macro-economic policy, employment and social cohesion; 4. Stresses that the common monetary policy pre-supposes increased coordination of financial policy; 5. Welcomes the Social Partners Summit which was convened within the framework of the Barcelona Summit and the intention to have a Social Summit every year preceding the Spring European Councils; takes note of the invitation to social partners to produce an annual report on their efforts at national and European level in the Employment strategy to be presented to this Summit, but stresses the autonomy of the European social partners as to the content of the multiannual programme to be presented in December 2002; calls on the Commission, the Council, the ECB and the social partners to improve the macro-economic
