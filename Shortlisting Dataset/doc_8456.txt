Question for written answer E-002065/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) and Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) (4 March 2011) Subject: Situation of the Porto de Abrigo Cooperative (Azores) — Fish Producers' Organisation The Portuguese fish producers’ organisation set up by the Porto de Abrigo Coooperative (São Miguel, Azores) is recognised by the European Union, and for years it has been drawing up and submitting Operational Plans, which always went through the procedural and financial channels without difficulty and were always approved. On 19 February 2010, this organisation submitted the procedural material concerning the 2009 Fisheries Operational Plan (FOP), accompanied by a request for payment of compensation under Regulation (EC) No 744/2008, having made in good time all the amendments and provided all the explanations requested in the meantime. The organisation was subsequently notified that both the implementation report on 2009 and the FOP for 2010 had both been approved. However, so far no payments whatever have been forthcoming. 1. Does the Commission know what is causing the delay in the payment of the compensation? 2. Has the Commission already made, or will it be making, any efforts to resolve this problem, given the inevitable negative impact of non-payment, both on the organisation’s ability to carry out its duties and on its members?
