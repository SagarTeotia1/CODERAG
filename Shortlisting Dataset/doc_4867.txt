Reply (18 July 2005) The Council remains concerned by the human rights situation in Eritrea in general, and in particular by the situation of religious freedom, which it is monitoring closely. The EU's concerns in this respect have been raised on several occasions in the context of political dialogue with the Eritrean Government. In particular, at a meeting of that dialogue specifically devoted to the issue of religious freedom, EU representatives raised their concerns about the lack of freedom of religion and the arrests of members of various religious groups. Despite a lack of positive commitments by the Eritrean Government in this area, the EU remains determined to continue its efforts to make the Eritrean authorities aware of its concerns about freedom of religion and the situation of those detained because of their religious convictions, as well as the human rights situation in Eritrea. In practical terms, religious freedom and the transparency of the procedures for registering minority religious groups have been formally identified as the criteria to be taken into account at the next assessment, due in September, of progress in the context of political dialogue with Eritrea.
