WRITTEN QUESTION E-0749/08 by Saïd El Khadraoui (PSE) to the Commission (15 February 2008) Subject: The bird population in the EU Birdlife International, in collaboration with the British universities of Durham and Cambridge, has compiled a climate atlas. It describes the possible impact of a 3 °C warming of the climate on the distribution of bird species at the end of this century. This reveals that the warming of the climate will have an enormous impact on the bird population throughout Europe. In Belgium, for example, the meadow pipit, common snipe and icterine warbler would disappear. Because of climate change, by the end of the century they will no longer be able to find suitable breeding areas. 1. Is the Commission aware of Birdlife International's climate atlas? 2. Is the Commission planning specific measures with regard to the bird population in EU Member States? A revision of the Wild Birds Directive or the Habitats Directive? Projects to extend breeding areas for these birds?
