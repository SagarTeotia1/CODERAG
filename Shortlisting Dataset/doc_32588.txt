Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2011) The Commission is not directly involved in the implementation, funding of individual projects eligible under the European Social Fund (ESF) programmes in Scotland and the settlement of payments to beneficiaries on national level. The Commission deals with all statement of expenditures submitted by the Scottish Managing Authority in accordance with the General Regulation 1083/2006 OJ L 210, 31.7.2006. which stipulates the general rules for payments on Commission's level. All possible funding, terms of payments and deadlines of payments to beneficiaries fall under the competence of the Member State and are subject to national regulations implemented by the Scottish Managing Authority (Structural Funds Division of the Scottish Government) and the Intermediate Administrative Body (ESEP) for the Scottish Lowlands and Uplands Programme. Therefore, questions about slow payments and lengthy claim processes within the Scottish Managing Authority as well as what improvements could be made in future in order to speed up and streamline the application and payment processes in the Scottish ESF Operational Programmes, should be addressed directly to the Structural Funds Division of the Scottish Government.
