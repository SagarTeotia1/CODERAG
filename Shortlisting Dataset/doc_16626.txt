between the risks and rewards of entrepreneurship and promote the spirit of enterprise in society; 19. Urges the Member States to make more intensive use than hitherto of the numerous positive examples from other Member States for their own programme for the promotion of entrepreneurship; 20. Is of the opinion that the Member States must make a much greater effort in their areas of responsibility (education policy, rules and regulations, cost and time involved in establishing new businesses, provision of risk capital and start-up finance, innovation and technology transfer and tax relief, in particular making provision for risks through the establishment of reserves) in order to give greater encouragement to entrepreneurship; 21. Insists on the need for the Member States to ensure that entrepreneurs acquire professional skills in advance and continue to develop them; looks to the latter to make a genuine effort to promote apprenticeships and training and to take practical measures to encourage the transnational mobility of apprentices, which are essential factors for the stability and durability of European enterprises; 22. Urges in this connection the Member States to ensure swifter implementation of the European Charter for Small Enterprises and to adopt good practice from other Member States; recalls that SMEs and micro‑enterprises are increasingly affected by Community legislation and various Community rules; considers that the Commission, therefore has a responsibility towards these enterprises and that the implementation of the Green Paper and the Charter is also its direct responsibility; 23. Is of the opinion that the diminution in the administrative burden on small businesses, better rules and regulations and easier access to funding and information, particularly with regard to access to third country markets, and greater dissemination of such information, are of considerable significance in creating a more favourable overall climate; 24. Recalls that enterprises, in particular small and micro-enterprises, need quality advice and support services; reiterates to the Commission its request that it should encourage the formation of European specifications for enterprises in consultation with SMEs; 25. Joins with the Council in urging the Commission to produce by the end of 2003 a suitable action plan for entrepreneurship that takes into account the proposals aired in the public debate and believes that it is essential to press ahead rapidly with effective implementation of the action plan on simplifying and improving the quality of the regulatory environment; 26. Calls on the Commission to register and publish the quantitative and qualitative results of the various Community initiatives and financial programmes for strengthening and developing SMEs; 27. Points out that, while the creation of new businesses is undoubtedly important, the focus must be on the quality of start-ups, not the quantity; stresses that too great a focus on start-ups in the Action Plan risks being to the detriment of existing small businesses and therefore failing to tackle the most deep-rooted and significant obstacles to entrepreneurial activity; 28. Sees considerable potential in the EU's internal market programme for promoting the establishment of new businesses and believes that in the European internal market for those starting up new businesses in the services sector
