Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (27 May 2011) As a general rule and according to the principles of shared management, the implementation of the EU Structural Funds and in particular the selection of projects is the responsibility of the Member State. In case the Romanian authorities decide to invest in the airport of Cluj Napoca, the eligibility criteria defined at the national level must be respected. Aid can be provided to airports based on proper justification. This will include compliance with a set of criteria comprising, as a minimum: traffic, safety, isolation, economic viability and sustainability. The Commission suggests the Honourable Member contacts directly the managing authority of the programme ‘Transport’, 38 Dinicu Golescu Bd, district 1, Bucharest, (www.ampost.ro).
