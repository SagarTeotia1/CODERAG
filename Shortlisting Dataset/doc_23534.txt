P6_TA(2006)0225 Treaty establishing the Energy Community B6-0279/2006 European Parliament resolution on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy Community Treaty The European Parliament , – having regard to the Commission proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy Community Treaty ( COM(2005)0435 ), – having regard to the Council's draft decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy Community Treaty (13886/1/2005), – having regard to the legal basis chosen for the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty, which effectively limits the role of the European Parliament to giving or withholding its assent to the conclusion of the Treaty, without any effective participation in the decision-making procedure, – having regard to its position of 18 May 2006 on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Energy Community Treaty Texts Adopted , P6_TA(2006)0219 . giving its assent to the conclusion of the Treaty, – having regard to Rule 108(5) of its Rules of Procedure, 1. Notes that the EC, by means of the conclusion of this Energy Community Treaty (ECT), in a sense creates a precedent by extending the acquis communautaire of the internal market in the field of electricity and gas to the nine contracting parties to the ECT; 2. Demands an unequivocal commitment by the contracting parties to the ECT to respect and implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; 3. Notes also that, of the nine contracting parties to the Treaty, three are candidate countries (Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia), one has applied for membership (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), four are potential candidates (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia) and one is under UN Interim Administration (Kosovo); 4. Points to the fact that in the case of the internal market, additional measures conceived as instruments to support the internal market or considered necessary in order to mitigate any negative effects have been adopted, whereas in the case of the ECT, the Council Decision foresees no such measures and this could lead to serious distortions of competition with EU players by undermining the standards applied in the internal market; notes that, therefore, matters relating to employment, social impact and restructuring, working conditions, equality, health and safety, information and consultation and social dialogue will be treated in a separate Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), whose legal status is not specified; demands that the MoU should be signed by the Commission, Council and governments concerned and should be developed to become a legally binding instrument; 5. Supports the participation of representatives of the social partners from the contracting parties to the ECT in the European sectoral social dialogue committees, where they exist, which the Commission is to enable; 6. Seeks clarification by the Council and the Commission of the inclusion of provisions and programmes to increase energy efficiency, prioritise the demand side, replace energy infrastructure and support renewable energy, notably to reduce widespread energy poverty, energy/hydrocarbon import dependence and the harmful environmental impact of energy
