ORAL QUESTION H-0292/02 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Lennart Sacrédeus to the Commission Subject: Costs of enlargement According to the Commission's proposal concerning funding for the applicant countries under the common agricultural policy, those countries will not be granted aid on the same conditions as the present Member States until the year 2013. Many of the applicant countries' representatives have expressed their dissatisfaction with the proposal. However, there are indications that they are prepared to accept lower levels of aid initially if they know that they will obtain the same conditions as the present Member States' farmers more quickly. Does the Commission take the same view and, if so, does that not reinforce the demands for a speedy reform of the common agricultural policy?
