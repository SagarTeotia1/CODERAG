WRITTEN QUESTION E-3894/07 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (1 August 2007) Subject: Ways of reaching agreement with Serbia on independence for Kosovo and hence of avoiding the need to chose between unilateral recognition and the status quo 1. Does the Commission recall the two unanswered questions which I asked on Wednesday, 11 July 2007 during the plenary debate in the European Parliament in Strasbourg further to its statement on a future agreement on Kosovo, the content of which is summarised below: (a) Could a possible veto in the UN Security Council against the Ahtisaari report lead to unilateral recognition of Kosovo as a State by other States, including EU Member States, just as in 1992 the independence of Slovenia and Croatia was recognised by the Federal Republic of Germany in advance of European and international decisions? (b) Could the occurrence of this controversial scenario be prevented if the area in the north of Kosovska Mitrovica, where the Serbian population of Kosovo is concentrated, were returned to Serbia? Would the agreement of Serbia and the Russian Federation be obtainable if this were the case? 2. Is one justified in concluding that an important element in the Commission’s attitude to this matter could be described as a desire to achieve a combination of international recognition of the independence of Kosovo with collaboration by Serbia in achieving this independence and agreement to it by the Russian Federation? 3. Which of the following four measures, which could encourage Serbia to lend the necessary cooperation and the Russian Federation to give its consent, does the Commission most vigorously reject and exclude from the outset as a negotiating stance: (a) Cooperation in achieving full integration into Serbia of the Serbian Republic (SR), which to date has been internationally recognised as part of the neighbouring country of Bosnia and Herzegovina; (b) substantial financial and economic injections for Serbia and as much flexibility as possible in giving Serbia priority for accelerated EU accession; (c) continuation of at least its current level of self-government for Kosovo, but also of its current status of international recognition as part of Serbian territory, and hence no seat at the United Nations; (d) complete, internationally recognised independence for Kosovo, but secession of the Serbian-inhabited north of Kosovska Mitrovica and everything to the north thereof to Serbia?
