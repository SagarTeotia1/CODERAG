Question for written answer E-001767/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Angelika Werthmann (NI) (14 February 2012) Subject: Youth Opportunities On 20 December 2011 the Commission launched the ‘Youth Opportunities’ initiative to take specific steps to improve the situation of young people in the labour market and to reduce youth unemployment in Europe. 1. Among other things, the initiative plans to arrange at least 130 000 traineeships in 2012 as part of the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci Programmes. Does this measure mainly relate to the arrangement of grants within the framework of these programmes, or is the Commission also offering specific help with finding traineeships? 2. The initiative also plans to provide EUR 1.3 million from the European Social Fund for the creation of apprenticeship positions. How will this measure benefit Member States that, unlike Austria or Germany, do not have a dual system of vocational training in businesses, but primarily provide vocational training through specialist schools? 3. In addition, the Commission has also set the target of helping 5 000 young people find a job in another Member State in 2012 and 2013, as part of the ‘Your First EURES Job’ initiative. What is the precise nature of the assistance the Commission can provide?
