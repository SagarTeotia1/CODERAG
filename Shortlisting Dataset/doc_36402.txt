WRITTEN QUESTION E-6482/09 by Hans-Peter Martin (NI) to the Council (4 January 2010) Subject: Consequences of lowering Spain's credit rating The Government of Spain reacted with a show of optimism to published reports that the rating agency Standard & Poor is considering downgrading the country’s credit rating again. How does the Council rate the danger that Spain will be downgraded again? What danger is there, in the Council's view, that there could be a domino effect across the euro countries if Spain were to become insolvent because of higher risk premiums?
