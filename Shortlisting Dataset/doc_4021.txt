Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (25 January 2006) The Commission is certainly aware of the concerns by certain analysts that the point of oil peak production is likely to occur sooner than suggested. At this stage, these concerns constitute no more than a theory; however, the Commission keeps itself constantly updated on the developments of the theory itself and the debates it has ushered. The Commission is furthermore closely following all developments affecting energy supply and demand. The Commission has noted that recently increases in energy demand and supply came at a price, as the energy world begins to question whether supply can continue to keep up with such increases in demand if it continues to increase at such levels in the short and medium term. This applies equally to oil refining capacity. This gives rise to new challenges for the world and for Europe in particular. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that Europe needs a reinvigorated and common energy policy to face these challenges. It needs to rethink its energy policy in a more coherent and coordinated manner, on the basis of a joint approach developed together with the Member States. The Commission is thus reflecting on a policy framework which should lead to a sustainable and highly efficient long-term energy profile of the European Union.
