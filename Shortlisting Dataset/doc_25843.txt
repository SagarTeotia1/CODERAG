WRITTEN QUESTION E-1840/09 by Derek Roland Clark (IND/DEM) to the Commission (23 March 2009) Subject: Directive 2005/32/EC on energy-using products Directive 2005/32/EC OJ L 191, 22.7.2005, p. 29. is a proposal to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides from domestic heating installations using oil as the energy source. In the UK 1.1 million homes are heated by oil and this directive will pose a unique problem there. The fuel used in the UK is kerosene or heating oil whereas continental practice is to use diesel oil. This poses a serious problem in the UK as regards developing new technology. Moreover, the boiler units will have to be larger and are unlikely to fit into most UK household locations, which are almost always within the house, whereas continental practice is to place the unit in a cellar or outhouse. Would the Commission please specify the date by which this directive is to come into force and what provision has been made for the very different situation in the UK?
