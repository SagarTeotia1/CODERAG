use of existing resources to tackle issues of territorial development and identify joint responses to common challenges, C. whereas in order to increase the effectiveness of regional policy the idea of an integrated approach should be supported and developed, including the creation of strategies for macro-regions that are strategies for the whole of the European Union, D. whereas the Baltic Sea Strategy already provides a model for coordinating EU policies and funding in geopolitical territorial units – macro-regions – defined on the basis of specific criteria, E. whereas the Danube region, comprising 14 European countries and 115 million people both within and outside the EU – Germany, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Moldova and Ukraine – is an area where enhanced synergies between various EU policies – cohesion, transport, economic, energy, environment, enlargement and neighbourhood policies – can be developed, F. whereas the EU Strategy for the Danube Region should therefore combine economic, environmental, social and cultural elements, G. whereas the Danube region constitutes an interconnected macro-region with heterogeneous economic capacities, H. whereas the economic development of the Danube region will significantly increase the economic wealth of this macro-region and stimulate employment, 1.

Believes that the Strategy’s territorial dimension will lead to the concrete development of the idea of territorial cohesion, which the Treaty of Lisbon places on an equal footing with economic and social cohesion, and with this in mind calls on the Commission to engage in active dialogue on the role and impact of EU macro-regional policies after 2013; 5.
