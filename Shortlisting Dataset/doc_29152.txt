WRITTEN QUESTION E-2825/05 by Werner Langen (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 July 2005) Subject: Status of the MasterCard case The Commission’s Statement of Objection in the MasterCard International case (Comp/34.324, Comp/34.579, Comp/35.578, Comp/38.580) has been pending since 24 September 2003. Since then the Commission has not, to my knowledge, published anything on the subject, and a planned hearing at the Commission with MasterCard representatives was cancelled. Would the Commission therefore answer the following questions: 1. Is there a new date for a hearing on this subject at the Commission? 2. Has there been any reply from MasterCard to the Commission’s Statement of Objections, and if so, are extracts from it publicly available? 3. What is the further timetable for the case, and when can a decision be expected from the Commission?
