Question for written answer E-9239/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Konrad Szymański (ECR) (9 November 2010) Subject: Vertical agreements and concerted practices in the motor vehicle sector Commission Regulation (EU) No 461/2010 of 27 May 2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the motor vehicle sector has been in force since June 2010. In Poland, a draft Council of Ministers regulation has been prepared to transpose the abovementioned Commission Regulation into national law. The draft diverges from the Commission Regulation on certain aspects as a result of the specific characteristics of the Polish car industry. With this in mind: Is the Commission intending to take action in response to the fact that the definition of ‘parts of matching quality’ in paragraph 2, point 22 of the draft regulation is taken from Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002, when the current guidelines (the Commission guidelines published in OJ 2010/C 138/05, point 20) contain a new definition? If so, what action will the Commission be taking? Is the Commission aware that the wording of paragraph 2, point 24(b) of the draft regulation might give the impression that agreements setting a minimum level for spare part purchases might be exempt from antitrust rules, when this is not in fact the case? Is such wording in line with EC law? What stance is the Commission intending to take on paragraph 19 of the draft regulation, the wording of which opens up the possibility of exemptions for clauses drawn up as part of vertical agreements in contracts concluded for periods of less than five years? The Commission assumes that relevant market share for car manufacturers always exceeds 30 %. This means they are not covered by the exemptions contained in Regulation (EC) No 461/2010. Does the way that paragraph 19 is worded comply with EC law?
