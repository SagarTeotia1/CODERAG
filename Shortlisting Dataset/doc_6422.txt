WRITTEN QUESTION E-3983/08 by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE) to the Commission (15 July 2008) Subject: Consumer protection Promoting consumers’ rights, prosperity and wellbeing are core values of the European Union, and this is reflected in its laws. Directive No 85/577/EEC OJ L 372, 31.12.1985, p. 31. is an example of this. However, compliance with this legislation falls far short of the ideal. I base this statement on specific cases in which mainly unsuspecting elderly people were faced with aggressive sales demonstrations during a bus trip organised by the firm of Goltex. The travellers were offered a bus trip through the Netherlands, presented as an opportunity to enjoy the pleasant scenery for a low price. However, the unsuspecting travellers were taken to a large room where they were subjected to highly aggressive sales demonstrations. The target group consisted of elderly people, most of them well over 80. Highly aggressive sales methods make people feel they have to make a purchase. It is then hard if not impossible to get away without buying something. 1. Does the Commission receive many complaints about such practices? 2. Does the Commission keep a record of such abuses? 3. Can the Commission state what action can be taken against the firm of Goltex?
