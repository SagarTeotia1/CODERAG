Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (15 October 2009) 1. Relevant EU funds are already allocated in the context of the Rural Development Programme for 2007‑13 for Greece, which includes various eligibilities for the restoration of the forestry potential and the introduction of prevention actions, as well as for the reconstitution of private investments that have been damaged by the fires, such as plant and trees or livestock units. For these purposes the programme earmarked, in total, EUR 163 million of support from the national European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) envelope. Within the context of the Health Check revision of the 2007‑13 ‘Rural Development Programme’ and in particular in the context of the new challenges the Greek authorities have proposed a financial reinforcement of these measures. If the allocated amounts are not sufficient to cover the needs, Greece has the possibility to reinforce the relevant measures of the Rural Development Programme for 2007‑13 through a financial re-profiling or to submit a notification for a state aid regime. Whether the conditions for financial assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund are met can only be assessed if the Greek national authorities make an application to the Commission within 10 weeks of the start of the disaster. The Commission itself may not take the initiative. 2. Under the ‘Regional Operational Programme — Attica’ for 2000‑06 and in particular under the Measure 2.4 ‘Afforestation and Fire Protection’ co-funded by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (Guidance Section) a limited number of eligibilities for fire-fighting actions have been included such as the purchase of jeeps, water tanks and mobile communication equipment. The total allocation of this measure was spent by the Greek authorities.
