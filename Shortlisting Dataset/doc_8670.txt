Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (7 April 2006) The Commission is very much aware of the many issues raised by the use of depleted uranium ammunitions. The opinion of the Group of Experts, established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, issued following the use of depleted uranium in the Balkan conflict, concluded that radiation doses from such activities would generally be very low. The opinion can be downloaded from the Commission’s website http://europa.eu.int/comm/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/art31/opinion_en.pdf . With respect to potential environmental hazards of firing depleted uranium ammunition in marine test ranges, the Commission has stated on several occasions that no contamination of the marine environment, distinguishable from naturally occurring concentrations of uranium, is likely to result from this activity. As far as health effects on the Scottish population are concerned, in particular an elevated incidence rate for leukaemia, available data does not indicate any linkage to the use of depleted uranium. The Commission is not aware of any new developments that would change its present evaluation of the impact of test firing of depleted uranium ammunition into sea waters. The Commission is nevertheless following closely the ongoing work by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organisation on health and environmental effects of depleted uranium.
