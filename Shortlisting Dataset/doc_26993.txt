Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2007) The report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group is addressed to the American president and to the American administration. It is one of the various studies that have been issued recently. The Commission welcomes efforts aiming to improve the situation in Iraq. The Commission believes that stability in Iraq will require action not only in the security domain but also in political and economic areas, if national reconciliation is to be pursued. It is important to underline the need for a comprehensive political approach and of a constructive involvement of the international community, notably the United Nations (UN) and Iraq’s neighbours. The Commission is looking forward to working with the international community in a joint effort to help the Iraqi people to achieve the peace and prosperity they deserve.
