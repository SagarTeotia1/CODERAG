9999/C Q999 E/052 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1035/04 by Joachim Wuermeling (PPE-DE) to the Council (24 March 2004) Subject: Visa for the European Union In order for a visa for the European Union to be granted, applicants must 'have adequate means for their subsistence and their return' (Common Consular Instructions on visas for the diplomatic missions and consular posts OJ C 313, 16.12.2002, p. 1 . ). The diplomatic mission or consular post must be offered 'a guarantee' that this is the case. By means of a circular issued by the German Foreign Office, the Federal Republic of Germany has instructed consular authorities to only refuse visitors' visas if it appears 'sufficiently likely that the applicant is not willing to return'. In case of doubt a visa should be granted. 1. Is this practice by the German Foreign Office compatible with part III paragraph 3 of the Common Consular Instructions? 2. If not, what measures have been taken to ensure that the Federal Republic of Germany adopts practices which comply with the legislation?
