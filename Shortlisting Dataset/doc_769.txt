Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (4 November 2011) 1. The Commission is not aware of the allegations of poor treatment of animals in the Alhama region in Spain. 2. The website indicated by the Honourable Member contains allegations on the maltreatment of dogs, a matter which is not governed by any provisions of EC law. The Commission has therefore no possibility to act in this field.
