Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2011) The Commission's external dimension of the EU energy policy aims inter alia at strengthening partnership, by encouraging and assisting neighbouring countries to support their national energy policies and legal reforms that will guarantee inter alia appropriate market conditions and stability of investments for the promotion of renewable energy resources. Furthermore, the Energy 2050 Roadmap adopted on 13 December 2011 develops a set of scenarios with a view to shaping a common vision for Member States' future decarbonisation agenda. Importing substantial volumes of solar energy from the South Mediterranean in the long-term is among the considered EU policy options. It is in this context that concerning the Southern neighbourhood the Commission shares the objectives and supports the Desertec Initiative. Developing large-scale solar generation capacities in the Southern Mediterranean countries could become a project of genuine co-development between Europe and the South and provide opportunities for the industry both in Europe and in the region concerned. The Desertec Industrial Initiative is a forward-looking initiative, and the private sector financing that it is based upon can serve as a key for transformation to a low-carbon future, both in Europe and in North-Africa. In addition to Desertec the Commission is already supporting a number of initiatives aiming at the deployment of renewable energy in the Southern Mediterranean under bilateral and regional assistance programmes and through financial assistance from the Neighbourhood Investment facility. It is in this context that a EUR 30 million grant is being made available to co-finance the construction of the Ouarzarzate solar plant in Morocco that is referred to in the question.
