Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2011) Following its answer to Written Question E‑8420/2010 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB , the Commission confirms that the proposal for a directive on credit agreement relating to residential property COM(2011)142. adopted in March 2011 was accompanied by a Staff Working Paper on National Measures and Practices to Avoid Foreclosure Procedures for Residential Mortgage Loans (SEC(2011) 357final) Available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SEC:2011:0357:FIN:EN:PDF the purpose of which was to give a picture of the existing national measures that can be undertaken before lenders need to resort to foreclosure. The practices mentioned in the Staff Working Paper should be considered within their respective national contexts. In many cases it is still too early to measure to what extent they have been adequately flexible and responsive to the economic crisis as well as to assess their effectiveness. As far as debt settlement and foreclosure procedures are concerned, these are dealt with at national level and remain within the jurisdiction of the national authorities concerned.
