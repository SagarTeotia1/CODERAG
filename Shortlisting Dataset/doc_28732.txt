Reply (27 June 2006) The European Council reached agreement on the Financial Perspective in December 2005 after lengthy and difficult negotiations. The overall ceiling for expenditure for the period 2007‑13 was set at EUR 862 billion, although this was subsequently increased to EUR 864 billion as part of the overall agreement reached with the European Parliament within the framework of the negotiation on a new interinstitutional agreement. The package and overall ceiling inevitably constitute a compromise, endorsed by all 25 Member States, between a range of different interests. It would accordingly be inappropriate for the Council to comment on the impact of this agreement on any one individual Member State.
