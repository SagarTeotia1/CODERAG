In adopting a resolution on the subject, Parliament notes that the causes of the accident are still to be determined but that the ship was under the orders of a local pilot at the time. The Pakistani authorities have barred the crew of the ship, four Greek citizens and three from the Philippines, from leaving the country, and have also arrested the engineer Nicolaos Pappas, who arrived after the accident to lead the salvage effort. Parliament expresses its concern at the situation of the crew and of Mr Pappas, noting that one of the crew members, Georgios Koutsos attempted suicide in January 2004. It states its belief that the continued detention of these individuals is unacceptable. MEPs call on the Pakistani government to free the persons who have been detained and give an assurance that it will be possible for them to be repatriated. MEPs are calling on the Commission and Council to make the necessary diplomatic efforts to resolve this matter.

In the resolution, MEPs deplore the cases of bankruptcy due to fraud in large public companies and the resulting social and economic effects and call for those responsible to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. MEPs express concern over the fact that "neither the supervisors nor the regulatory authority nor the auditors nor the rating agencies" had the slightest suspicion that funds were being embezzled. They believe the financial services industry should "clean up its act" and redouble its efforts to ensure that the small minority of fraudulent market participants are brought to justice. Financial institutions should reimburse investors for losses for which they are responsible. More broadly, Parliament wants to strengthen corporate governance and financial supervision. A long term recommendation is the establishment of a single authority for financial prudential supervision in Europe. MEPs want legislation to enhance individual responsibility of board members and the inclusion of independent directors on a management board in order to guarantee better auditing. Parliament also wants more involvement of employees and calls for the presence of representatives of employees
