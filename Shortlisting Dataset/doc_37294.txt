WRITTEN QUESTION E-3357/05 by Nigel Farage (IND/DEM) to the Commission (26 September 2005) Subject: Commissioner's interests In the spirit of openness and transparency, and in the light of the Commissioners' Code of Conduct which states, ‘Commissioners shall not accept any gift with a value of more than EUR 150’ and, ‘The Commission’s Protocol department shall keep a public register of gifts with a value of more than EUR 150’, would Commissioner Verheugen please reveal the receipt of any holiday or hospitality paid for by somebody not himself in 2005? Would the Commission also ensure that any such gift is mentioned on the public register of gifts held by the Protocol department?
