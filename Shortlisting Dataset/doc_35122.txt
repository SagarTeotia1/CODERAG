WRITTEN QUESTION P-1388/07 by Gerardo Galeote (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (13 March 2007) Subject: List of protected areas in Andalusia The Commission has already approved the decisions on the provisional lists of sites of Community interest (SCI) in all the bio-geographical regions of the Natura 2000 network, pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 . on the preservation of natural habitats and woodland, fauna and flora. It appears that Spain intends to submit an application for new special bird protection area (SBPA) in Andalusia, namely the ‘Alto Guadiato’, code number ES6100001. This proposal has generated widespread alarm, due to the lack of scientific rigour displayed when it comes to identifying the protected species and the socioeconomic impact this new SBPA is going to have on the locality concerned. Furthermore, there have been various irregularities as regards the months-long permutations of the geographical delimitation of the SBPA, particularly with regard to the exclusion of the Finca El Río, and possible connections with the town-planning irregularities in Marbella. Can the Commission tell me whether Spain has in fact already submitted its application? Is the Commission going to investigate the irregularities referred to above? Is it going to urge the Member States to finalise the designation of protected areas in a transparent manner and by a specific deadline, so as to avoid legal uncertainty?
