Considers that using renewable energy sources would not only make it possible to reduce the problems caused by the high cost of oil, but at the same time would have very beneficial effects on the environment; 5. Considers that it is essential for the Member States to adopt a plan to optimise the use of energy sources by all Member States in order to reduce demand for crude oil; 6. Calls on the Commission to establish a centre for the monitoring of oil price rises with a view to minimising the disruptive speculation caused by the lack of transparency in the oil market; 7. Considers that if such a monitoring centre is to function effectively it should receive data not only from the Member States, but also from national oil companies; 8. Calls on the Commission to work with the Member States to formulate a joint strategy which could avert future crises and to reach international agreements which could stabilise oil prices; 9. Calls on the Member States to assess the possibility of reducing inland duties, since they have knock-on effects on oil prices; 10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, and the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States.
