the poor, Q. whereas over the last 30 years chronic famine and child labour have been halved in the developing countries, life expectancy has increased from 46 to 64 years and infant mortality has fallen from 18% to 8%; whereas today, 70% of the population in the developing countries have access to clean drinking water, as compared with 45% in 1980, R. whereas the lives and livelihoods of most people in most LDCs are not directly linked to the international economy and there is a strong likelihood that export-led growth could lead to "enclave-led growth" in countries exporting manufactured goods, minerals and oil, which is particularly evident in agriculture-exporting LDCs where the benefits from trade in commodities and agricultural products decline for producers and grow for retailers; whereas economic growth requires not simply export expansion, but also an inclusive, economy-wide expansion of income-earning opportunities, notably the strengthening of the development links between agricultural and non-agricultural activities, S. whereas, in order to compete with world farm prices, the poorest countries on the planet are encouraged to concentrate on a limited number of products, intended solely for export; whereas the resulting development of monocultures is accompanied by the abandonment of the traditional food crops necessary to feed local populations and a growing dependence on imports of basic products and on uncontrollable fluctuations in world markets, T. whereas for the poor countries the value of exporting their products to world markets depends on maintaining remunerative prices, particularly in the developed countries; whereas the current trend towards abolishing customs barriers is producing an inevitable fall in prices on these markets, threatening the development prospects of the world’s poorest countries, U. whereas according to a study based on the data of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UN, trade liberalisation has cost sub-Saharan Africa USD 272 billion over the past 20 years; whereas mass poverty reinforces the tendency towards economic stagnation and many countries in the region are undertaking very ambitious economic reforms in order to lift themselves out of such poverty; whereas the expertise and assistance of the international community is essential in this regard, V. whereas attaining the MDGs and combating global poverty will require a trade environment in which developing countries have real access to the markets of developed countries, more equitable trade practices, strong and enforced rules of protection on the environment and social rights, the effective relief of unsustainable debt, and for all donors to increase not so much the amount, but the effectiveness of aid, linking it to programmes to reform economic and social structures and improve democratic governance, W. whereas increasing the volume of exports by the poor countries is a necessary condition for their development, but not sufficient in itself; whereas, while this helps to increase the amount of wealth produced, it does not automatically guarantee an improvement in the social conditions experienced by local populations working in the production sector, X. whereas external trade can be an important tool for social and economic development when countries are able to protect their markets at the
