cont-press@europarl.eu.int Landmines: keeping up pressure for prohibition Motions for a resolution on the Preparation of the First Review Conference in Nairobi of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (Ottawa 'Mine Ban Treaty') Doc.: B5-0215/2004 , B5-0216/2004 , B5-0217/2004 , B5-0221/2004 , B5-0224/2004 Vote: 22.04.2004 Vote In a resolution adopted on 22 April 2004, the European Parliament urges all states that have not already done so to sign and ratify the Mine Ban Treaty (the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines). This should include the four states of the enlarged EU who have yet to ratify or accede to the treaty. Parliament believes that 2004 the First Review Conference in Nairobi should be structured to emphasise progress to date in pursuit of the four core aims of the Convention: clearing mined areas, assisting victims, destroying stockpiles of anti-personnel mines and universalising the Convention. MEPs call on the Nairobi Conference to make a strong commitment calling on all Non-State Actors to sign the ' Deed of Commitment for Adherence to a Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines and for Cooperation in Mine Action. ' They also call for increased resources to be made available for humanitarian demining, mine risk education and the care, rehabilitation and social and economic reintegration of mine victims, and for mine-affected states to establish appropriate and adequate assistance for landmine survivors in areas under state control or under the de facto control of armed non-state actors. Finally, MEPs urge the Council and Member States to speak with one voice at the conference.

In the accompanying resolution MEPs, however, raised a number of financial control issues where improvement is needed, focusing in particular on problems occurring with funds administered by the Member States. The resolution is highly critical of the "shared management" of EU funds, where the Commission decides on funding but delegates the actual payment and control to the Member States. This is the case in particular with agricultural expenditure and the structural funds. MEPs point out that where fraud and irregularities are not discovered or reported, it is the EU budget which bears the cost and not the Member States. The Member States should therefore bring their supervisory control systems up to par and the Commission should ensure that these systems are working properly. Member States and Commission should set up a single audit strategy for the shared management programmes. The Commission should also be tougher in launching infringement procedures and following them through. MEPs
