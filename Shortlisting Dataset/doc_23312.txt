Reply (19 April 2010) The European Parliament and the Council adopted on 23 April 2009 a package of legislation (‘the Energy/Climate package’) which is aimed at implementing the EU's independent commitment to reduce its emissions by 20 % by 2020 compared with 1990. The package comprises inter alia a revision of the Emissions Trading Scheme Directive Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community. OJ L 140, 5.6.2009, p. 63. and what is called the Effort Sharing Decision Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community's greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020. OJ L 140 of 5.6.2009, p. 136. . Possible decision-making on a higher target will take place in accordance with Article 28 of the revised ETS Directive and Article 8 of the Effort Sharing Decision. As regards the internal EU burden-sharing of climate finance, so far two meetings of the Friends of the Presidency Working Group on this issue have taken place. Their work is on hold until the European Council determines its position on the global financial mechanism 6721/1/10 REV 1. .
