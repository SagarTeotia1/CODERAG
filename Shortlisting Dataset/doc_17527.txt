end of 2001 and on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the intermediate results of the multi-annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets at 30 June 2002 ( COM(2002) 446 - COM(2002) 483 - 2002/2262(INI)) Doc.: A5-0332/2003 Procedure : Own-initiative report Debate : 23.10.2003 Rapporteur Patricia McKENNA (Greens/EFA, Dublin) is not sorry to see the end of the Multi-Annual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs), which were intended to reduce Community fleets from 1997 to 2002, but which fell far short of achieving this aim. In tabling a non-binding resolution on the Commission's annual report on the results of these programmes on behalf of the Fisheries Committee, Ms McKenna regrets the fact that the programmes failed to bring the European fishing fleets into a sustainable balance with the available resources. She stresses that only four Member States (Denmark, Spain, Finland and Portugal) had met all their individual objectives by June 2002. Too little attention is paid, the rapporteur says, to fishing methods and to the commitment of producer organisations. She calls upon the Commission and the Council to develop a programme that will, finally, bring the EU's fishing capacity into line with resources, without exporting vessels to other parts of the world where there is already an excess. What is needed is the development of fleets that provide a maximum of employment while not further depleting fish stocks or damaging the marine environment. Youth and Education Erasmus Mundus: opening up Europe's universities to the world Marielle DE SARNEZ (EPP-ED, F) Report on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through co-operation with third countries (Erasmus Mundus) (2004-2008) (8644/1/2003 – C5-0294/2003 – 2002/0165(COD)) Doc.: A5-0336/2003 Procedure : Co-decision (2nd reading) Debate : 20.10.2003 On behalf of the Culture Committee, Marielle DE SARNEZ (EPP-ED, F) is tabling a number of amendments at second reading to a decision setting up a new EU higher education programme - Erasmus Mundus, increasing the budget to €230 million. Whereas the existing Erasmus programme promotes university exchanges within the European Union, Erasmus Mundus seeks to open up Europe's universities and higher education establishments to students throughout the world. The programme will cover a five-year period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008. At first reading in April 2003, Parliament called for the budget of €200 million suggested by the Commission to be increased to €300 million provided this did not affect existing programmes and was within the limits laid down by the financial perspective. However, in its common position in June, the Council put forward a figure of €180 million. The Culture Committee proposes, following lengthy talks with the Council, to set the budget at €230 million. The Culture Committee hopes this figure will be accepted by the Council and that the co-decision procedure can thus be concluded at second reading without going to conciliation. The programme will provide grants for more than 4,000 postgraduate students from non-EU countries other than the EEA/EFTA
