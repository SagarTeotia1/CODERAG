of the overall EU targets for 2050; considers that the Commission should take measures if national targets are not met; 14. Stresses that increasing resource efficiency through, for instance, waste recycling, better waste management and behavioural change plays a very important role in the pursuit of the EU’s strategic objectives for CO2 emissions reduction; 15. Reiterates the importance of providing incentives for public and private investments geared to designing and developing easily replicable technologies to improve the quality of energy saving and efficiency; 16. Recalls that electricity grids will have to be upgraded and developed, in particular to transport renewable energy produced in areas with major potential, such as offshore wind energy in the Northern Sea and solar energy in southern Europe, and to accommodate the decentralised production of renewable energy; 17. Invites the Member States and the Commission to invest more in the energy infrastructure necessary for the transformation to a sustainable economy; emphasises that Europe should be at the cutting edge in the development of standards and interoperable energy-related Internet technologies and energy-efficient ICT applications, in particular smart grids, the full and timely deployment of smart home systems such as smart meters designed to benefit the consumer, and modernising and developing an interconnected European electricity supergrid and LNG infrastructures; emphasises, with regard to inter-regional connections, the need to launch an investment plan based notably on the European Energy Infrastructure Package to secure the diversification of energy supply sources; calls on the Commission to propose practical solutions for the efficient integration of large amounts of renewables by promoting market rules that allow for efficient and transparent international power exchange; calls therefore for the swift integration and uptake of cross-border electricity markets; recognises the urgent need for a long-term vision given the many years required to build energy infrastructure with a long lifetime; welcomes the focus on energy infrastructure in the proposed Connecting Europe Facility; 18. Calls for assurance that Article 10(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading will be applied, in particular with regard to investment in R&D; requests that a report be sent to Parliament; 19. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to push for a more rapid implementation of the G20 agreement on removing fossil-fuel subsidies; stresses that, in order to have the desired impact, implementation has to be internationally coordinated; 20. Notes the roadmap’s conclusion that the power sector should decarbonise almost completely by 2050 (93%-99% emissions reduction); recognises that from an EU industrial perspective, first movers on low-emission technologies have a competitive advantage in today and tomorrow’s low carbon world; notes that emission reductions should therefore be achieved in a way which does not harm the EU’s competitiveness and addresses the risk of carbon leakage, especially in energy-intensive sectors; 21. Notes the shift in sustainable scientific and technological innovation away from Europe to other parts of the world, which may lead to the EU losing its technological leadership in the field and turn it into a net importer of these technologies and related finished products; emphasises, therefore, the importance
