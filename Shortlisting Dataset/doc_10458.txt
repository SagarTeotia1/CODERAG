Question for written answer P-000961/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Ildikó Gáll-Pelcz (PPE) (3 February 2012) Subject: The ongoing excessive deficit procedure against Hungary and its possible future impact With regard to the statement made on 24 January by Olli Rehn, according to which Hungary needs to take further steps in order to achieve its deficit targets, otherwise the Commission may initiate sanctions, I would like to ask the following: 1. Why does the Commission fail to recognise that large-scale structural changes — which, besides healthcare, education and public administration, have also affected the Hungarian pension system — fundamentally help make a previously unsustainable system stable and predictable in the long term in addition to making a one-off contribution to reducing the budget deficit? 2. In the case of other countries (e.g. Greece, Spain, Portugal), wage and pension reductions and privatisation — which are also basically one-off adjustments — were approved. Why, then, are the same measures taken by Hungary subject to negative judgment? For me this is clearly an application of double standards. In your answer would you please make it clear that this judgment does not result from antipathy for the country but is due to obvious economic reasons. 3. Will you please give an example, in terms of economics, of a country that would be able to put itself on a path towards growth by implementing only austerity measures and, in addition, even has to put up with the sanction of the withdrawal of growth-promoting cohesion funds. 4. Within the euro area the deficit of numerous countries is above the 3 % ceiling. In your opinion, which economy can be viewed as more stable: an economy which, with just one-off adjustments, is heading towards the 3 % level, or which without such measures remains with a deficit of 8-10 %?
