WRITTEN QUESTION P-4347/05 by Francisco Assis (PSE) to the Commission (16 November 2005) Subject: Free gifts offered with food products Children are more vulnerable than adults to advertisers' persuasion and sales techniques. Sales of food products containing free gifts or mini-toys (as in the cases of chocolate eggs, crisps, etc.) take advantage of this: a free gift worth almost nothing in monetary terms is more appealing to a child than the product itself, and it is the gift that conditions the decision to buy. The problem is compounded by the fact that free gifts and mini-toys can lead to accidental suffocation, as children tend to put both edible and inedible objects from the same package into their mouths indiscriminately. In the US, the sale of food products with free gifts is illegal on safety grounds. We may conclude that there are European children who have died from fatal accidents involving asphyxia from such gifts who would still be alive today had they been living in the US. What action will the Commission take to strengthen safety standards in this area?
