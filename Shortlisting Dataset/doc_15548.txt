) Section III - Commission Draftsman: Jutta D. Haug SUGGESTIONS The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Notes that the practical impacts of the new multi-annual financial framework become evident in the Preliminary Draft Budget for 2007; notes that reconciling policy objectives with the funds made available in the financial framework poses a considerable challenge; demands that, in view of the tight financial framework, especially in the field of environmental protection, consumer health and food safety, Member States make full use of their national possibilities and close possible loopholes; 2. Considers the situation particularly worrying in the public health and food safety policy area, where the two agencies still in their development phase, EFSA and ECDC, take up most of the available funds, thus leaving the new Health Programme clearly worse off than in 2006; deplores that the position expressed by Parliament in its first reading of the Health Programme whereby the programme should be given a financial and political priority has not been respected by the Commission, but acknowledges the constraints caused by the narrow margin in Heading 3b; 3. Emphasises the asymmetry introduced by the Commission after the agreement on the new EU multiannual financial framework in the allocation of Heading 3b appropriations between the Health Programme and other actions in the same Heading which is not in line with the principles of prioritising, proportionality and equitable distribution; 4. Points out the considerable divergences in appropriations between the original Commission proposal for the Health Programme (€ 969 million) and its revised proposal (€ 365.6 million) which corresponds to a 62% fall in appropriations and which, moreover, fails to take into account the position adopted by the European Parliament at first reading to increase appropriations for the Health Programme by 55% , i.e. to € 1 500 million, despite its awareness of limited funding; 5. Calls for a review of the distribution of appropriations with a view to increasing Health Programme funds, so as to meet the requirements resulting from the enlargement of the Union and the challenges in this sector; 6. Draws attention to the general problem relating to the decentralised agencies, which are naturally entitled to have proper financing in order to carry out their tasks, but at the same time leave less and less money for other Community activities; calls for careful scrutiny of the tasks of the agencies, the activities carried out by the Commission and the activities financed from multi-annual programmes, in order to avoid any overlapping and to ensure that the necessary tasks are carried out in the most cost-efficient and rational way; points out that the receipt of fees for administrative costs generated by applications for authorisations could cover part of the funding of the agencies; 7. Points out that the newly adopted (paediatric medicines) and forthcoming (advanced therapy medicinal products) legislation and other new policies, such as activities relating to pandemics, will increase the workload and tasks of
