Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (19 May 2006) The Commission is currently finalising the selection process of 2006 LIFE nature projects, among which there is a project submitted by the Junta de Andalucía entitled ‘Conservation and reintroduction of the Iberian lynx in Andalucía’. This project was included on the list of selected projects submitted by the Commission and approved at the last meeting of the Habitats Committee, on 25 April 2006. However, the revision phase of the projects is still ongoing. If revision for this project were to conclude positively, the signature of the grant agreement would take place in June 2006. Long-term conservation needs for this species require a holistic approach, and the involvement of various stakeholders, ranging from public administrations to research institutes, universities, hunting associations, farmers’ associations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), etc. The ongoing project co-financed by LIFE, also mentioned in the question, meets this requirement. The new project, currently under examination, proposes a similar approach, involving a very wide range of stakeholders. Conservation of the Iberian lynx could clearly also benefit from funding by private stakeholders. When it comes to European Union funds, the species has already benefited or could benefit, inter alia , from rural development as well as structural funds. Synergies and complementarity of the various possible sources of funding should be ensured by the Spanish authorities.
