f an alternative technical solution as referred to in Article 11(5a) is implemented, that date may be changed in accordance with the procedure specifi ed in Article 17(2). Justification Under the current legislation the migration was to have been completed by 30 September 2009 or, subject to the extension available through comitology, by 30 June 2010 at the latest. The Commission has invoked this provision and put back the date to 20 June 2010. The sunset clause should be respected. The new date should be in line with the current forecasts that SIS II will become operational by the end of 2011. The Commission should be accorded the degree of flexibility required to enable it to set a later date under a comitology procedure and hence cover the possible need to switch from SIS II to an alternative scenario if the test results are unsatisfactory. Amendment 8 Proposal for a regulation – amending act Article 1 – point 3 a (new) Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 Article 11 – paragraph 5 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (3a ) Article 11 (5) is replaced by the following : “ 5. The switchover foreseen in the migration process shall be carried out after the validation mentioned in Article 8(7) and after the European Parliament has delivered a favourable opinion on the basis of the information on the test results provided by the Commissi on in accordance with Article 55 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006. ” Justification Matters relating to SIS II have fallen under the codecision procedure since 1 January 2005. The migration process is being financed from the EU budget, for which Parliament shares the responsibility. It follows that decisions concerning the migration should no longer be taken by the Commission and/or Council alone; on the contrary, Parliament should participate in the decision-making. Amendment 9 Proposal for a regulation – amending act Article 1 – point 3 b (new) Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 Article 11 – paragraph 6 (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (3b) In A rticle 11 , the following paragraph is added: “ 6 . The development of SIS II may be achieved by implementing an alternative technical solution. ” Justification Article 11, which describes the different stages of the migration, should contain a reference to a possible alternative scenario, in case the SIS II project proves not to be feasible. Amendment 10 Proposal for a regulation – amending act Article 1 – point 3 c (new) Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 Article 14 – paragraph 6 (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment ( 3c ) In A rticle 14, the following paragraph is added: " 6 .
