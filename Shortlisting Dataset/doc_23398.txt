WRITTEN QUESTION E-2285/07 by Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) to the Council (27 April 2007) Subject: Tallinn monument On 2 April 2007, the Council replied to my Question E‑1328/07, invoking Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and stating that the Council had not discussed the subject raised in the question. 1. Does the Council mean by this answer that it does not intend to discuss the matter referred to in E‑1328/07? 2. If so, can the Council explain why it does not consider itself concerned by a subject of major importance which could set a precedent for similar incidents?
