Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (26 March 2008) The Commission underlines that the Greek legislation implementing Directive 2001/23/EC Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses.OJ L 82, 22.3.2001. could apply in case of privatisation. The aim of Directive 2001/23/EC is to provide for the protection of employees in cases of transfer of undertaking business, or part of an undertaking or business, in particular to ensure that their rights are safeguarded. To this end, the directive provides in the main that (a) the transferor's rights and obligations arising from an employment relationship existing on the date of a transfer are transferred to the transferee, (b) the transfer is not in itself to constitute grounds for dismissal by the transferor or the transferee and (c) workers' representatives have certain rights to be informed and consulted. The Commission underlines that it is, in principle, up to the competent national authorities, and notably national courts, to ensure the respect of national and Community legislation. Concerning ‘universal service’, it is up to the national authorities to determine the need to impose Public Service Obligations (PSO) within the framework of EC Regulation No 2408/92 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes, OJ L 240, 24.8.1992. . According to the circumstances and under strict conditions, these PSOs can be restricted to a single operator. Any Community operator can apply to these PSOs.
