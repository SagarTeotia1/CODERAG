Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (6 June 2008) 1. The Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities DG drew up a document accompanying the 2008 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion adopted by the EPSCO Council on 29 February 2008. With regard to the issue of street children, this supporting document stresses (page 31) that the issue is being addressed by means of various strategies in the Member States, for example the United Kingdom (strategy on young runaways), Ireland (Youth Homelessness Strategy), Italy (centres for combating child begging) and Bulgaria and Hungary (social services for street children, street social work and district social work). 2. As part of the Community action programme ‘Progress’, the Commission is currently supporting the project ‘Dynamo International — Street social work in Europe because the street does exist’ (www.travail-de-rue.net), the objective of which is to increase the amount of professional social work on the streets and improve its quality. In particular, it seeks greater recognition of and support for street social work, better integration programmes for vulnerable young people and a bridging of the gap between adults and young people. Planned measures include sharing experiences on good practice, drawing up methodological guidelines on street social work and drafting recommendations to improve the social inclusion of vulnerable young people.
