ORAL QUESTION H-0141/02 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Konstantinos Alyssandrakis to the Commission Subject: Changes to the staff regulations of European Union officials The Commission's proposals to amend the staff regulations of European Union officials have caused deep concern. According to their trade unions, the proposals change the very nature of the civil service, call into question fundamental democratic principles governing the recruitment, career development and independence of civil servants, will cause chaos in the institutions by recategorising some 40 000 officials and jeopardise the interests of the general public. Does the Commission consider that the rules which apply to private enterprise can and should also apply to public service? What are its reasons for amending the staff regulations of officials and, in particular, their career scales? What is its response to the criticism that its proposals will result in the privatisation of a significant part of the civil service and create a network of patronage and favouritism? Finally, why does it not take seriously into account the counter-proposals of a large section of the trade unions with whom there is no real dialogue?
