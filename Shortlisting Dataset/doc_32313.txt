Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (10 April 2006) Point 5(2) of Annex II to Commission Directive 2000/56/EC Commission Directive 2000/56/EC of 14 September 2000 amending Council Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences, OJ L 237, 21.9.2000. lays down the minimum criteria with which vehicles used for tests of skills and behaviour must comply. It states that, for Category C, the vehicle must be equipped with a gearbox having at least eight forward ratios. It would appear that vehicles in this category currently being manufactured do not always comply with this requirement. The trend is, in fact, more towards having fewer gearbox ratios, or even towards the marketing of automatic heavy goods vehicles. The Commission is aware of the problems raised by the Honourable Member and recognises that the link between gearboxes in general, irrespective of the licence category concerned, and the definition of test vehicles used for the purpose of obtaining a particular licence, merits closer inspection. This can be done as part of the Commission’s ongoing work to harmonise driving tests in the Community and to bring examination requirements into line with current road traffic demands as well as with market trends for the various types of vehicle. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that this matter is not urgent, as the final paragraph of the above point 5(2) provides for a ten-year transition period, i.e. until 2013, during which time current test vehicles may still be used. There are, therefore, no grounds for believing that all category C test vehicles must have at least eight forward ratios from July 2007. Contrary to what is stated by the Honourable Member, the Driving Licence Committee did not take a decision on this matter at its meeting on 1 February 2006 but held a discussion, as is shown by the summary record sent to the Parliament on 9 February 2006.
