importance of ownership, the involvement of national parliaments in drawing up Country Strategy Papers has, in practice, been poor; finds it regrettable that the Commission has not adequately implemented the provisions of Articles 19, 20 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 on consultation with non-state actors and local authorities; 5. Notes that a ‘pro-growth’ strategy should not be confused with a long-term development strategy that entails the financing of long-term objectives such as health, education, access to energy in rural areas, support for small farmers, etc.; 6. Finds it regrettable that, in response to its resolutions highlighting non-observance of the requirement laid down in Article 2(4) of the regulation to fulfil the ODA eligibility criteria, the Commission amended or withdrew only three of 11 draft implementing measures concerned; 7. Finds it regrettable that the committee set up under Article 35 of the DCI did not react to Parliament’s resolutions signalling that the Commission had exceeded its implementing powers; notes with concern that the substantive scrutiny work carried out by Parliament did not receive any echo from the representatives of the Member States in the DCI Committee, and urges the Member States to assume their responsibilities and to ensure, in close collaboration with Parliament, that the measures proposed by the Commission comply fully with the DCI prescriptions; 8. Requests the Commission to indicate, in order of priority and with their respective weight, the criteria it has used for the allocation of funds between the DCI countries and regions and to the various sectors of activity within each geographic and thematic programme; 9. Considers that many country and regional strategy papers do not allocate sufficient resources to the DCI’s overarching goal of poverty eradication in the context of sustainable development, and that many documents do not indicate clearly how far the proposed actions will contribute to the MDGs targets; 10. Draws particular attention to the ODA eligibility requirement for the geographic programmes under the DCI and urges the Commission and the EEAS to ensure full compliance with this legal obligation in every case; 11. Points out that policy coherence for development, development ‘ownership’ and the non-fragmentation of aid are essential for ensuring aid effectiveness; Perspectives for the future: principles 12. Stresses that the EU continues to need a specific financing instrument for development cooperation, which targets exclusively developing countries and explicitly pursues the objectives defined in Article 208 TFEU; insists that the annual figures for ODA in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) period should increase in real terms to reach the collective target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2015; 13. Emphasises that full compliance with ODA criteria, and in particular with the OECD/DAC requirement that ‘each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective’ See OECD/DAC: ‘Reporting Directives for the Creditor Reporting System’. , must remain a condition for all measures to be funded as part of geographic programmes under the new instrument; calls for a more stringent ODA quota for thematic programmes than under the current DCI,
