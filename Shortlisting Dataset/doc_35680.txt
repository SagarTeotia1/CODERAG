Reply (1 September 2006) On 12 June 2006 the Council adopted a common position with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999, and on 8 June, after having arrived at a general approach, it requested the assent of the European Parliament on the text of the Council Regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The answer to the questions above is therefore subject to the final shape of the texts after adoption of the abovementioned regulations by the European Parliament and by the Council according to the respective procedures. While the Commission in its proposal, and afterwards the Council in the proceedings have not dealt with ‘metropolitan regions’, particular emphasis is nevertheless put on ‘urban areas’ within the European Union. The answer will therefore deal with this particular issue. In this context, except for several references to sustainable urban development within the regulations, the attention of the Honourable Member may be drawn, in particular to the following provisions: — Article 37(4) of the draft Council regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 which stipulates the obligation for an operational programme to contain for the convergence and regional competitiveness and employment objectives information on the approach to the sustainable urban development, where appropriate; — Article 37(6) of the draft Council Regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 which provides in addition that operational programmes may also contain for the convergence and regional competitiveness and employment objectives the list of cities chosen for addressing urban issues and the procedures for sub‑delegation to urban authorities, possibly by means of a global grant; Moreover, Article 8 of the common position adopted by the Council on 12 June 2006 with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999 is entirely dedicated to sustainable urban development and stipulates that: ‘In addition to the activities listed in Articles 4 and 5 of this Regulation, in the case of action involving sustainable urban development as referred to in Article 37(4)(a) of Regulation (EC) No …/…, the ERDF may, where appropriate, support the development of participative, integrated and sustainable strategies to tackle the high concentration of economic, environmental and social problems affecting urban areas. These strategies shall promote sustainable urban development through activities such as: strengthening economic growth, the rehabilitation of the physical environment, brownfield redevelopment, the preservation and development of natural and cultural heritage, the promotion of entrepreneurship, local employment and community development, and the provision of services to the population taking account of changing demographic structures.
