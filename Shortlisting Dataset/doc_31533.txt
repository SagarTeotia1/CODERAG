WRITTEN QUESTION E-2336/08 by Emmanouil Angelakas (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 April 2008) Subject: Uncontrolled marketing of food supplements in the European Union There have been numerous announcements recently by national medicine agencies and the EMEA (European Medicines Evaluation Agency) concerning the uncontrolled marketing of food supplements. Many of these products are manufactured in countries outside the EU, imported illegally into the EU and, typically: — have not been authorised by the relevant medicine agencies, — contain active substances above the permissible limits laid down by Directive 2002/46/EC OJ L 183, 12.7.2002, p. 51. ; — in many cases they make false therapeutic claims, in some cases they contain substances which are not listed on the label, e.g. anabolic substances, substances to treat erectile dysfunction, etc. 1. Has the Commission estimated the extent of this state of affairs in terms of the number of packages and turnover and, in particular, the percentage of these products imported from third countries, e.g. China? 2. What measures will it take to control these illegal imports and to provide information to inadequately informed consumers? 3. Given the vague classification of these products into various categories (food supplements, nutraceuticals, functional foods, novel foods, and foods for special medical purposes), does the Commission plan to supplement or amend the existing legislation on the authorisation and marketing of such products?
