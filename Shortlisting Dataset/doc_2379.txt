2004/C 51 E/069 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1060/03 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (28 March 2003) Subject: Financing of Swedish buffer funds A debate is under way in Sweden concerning the formation of buffer funds which, in the event of Sweden joining EMU, would be used to make adjustments during periods of economic instability and insecurity by, for example, lowering employers' contributions. The buffer funds require extensive resources if they are to be able to represent any significant adjustment mechanism in the future. What is the Commission's view of the possibility of financing the funds with the aid of monetary resources from the Swedish Central Bank, Riksbanken?
