WRITTEN QUESTION E-2239/04 by Brice Hortefeux (PPE-DE) to the Commission (29 September 2004) Subject: Anti-terrorism policy Recent events in Iraq and North Ossetia have led to debate on the EU’s anti-terrorism policy being re–opened as a matter of urgency. The number of targets for acts of terrorism is growing and the lack of a common anti–terrorism policy is weakening the EU, rendering it unable to take concerted action in response to imminent danger. Mr Javier Solana has already drawn up a European Security Strategy, and I understand that an action plan against terrorism also already exists. However, with these ‘theoretical’ measures piling up and no increase in information–sharing – something which has been criticised on many occasions – there is room for scepticism with regard to just how effective these measures are on the ground. Does the Commission not think it is high time we pooled our efforts, especially as regards information–sharing and border controls? Lastly, in the current geopolitical climate, would it not be more sensible to start working towards establishing a partnership with the representatives of moderate Muslims, rather than shilly–shallying over the axis of evil?
