studies have shown that there is no evidence for the claim that reducing dismissal protection and weakening standard employment contracts facilitates employment growth; points out that the example of the Scandinavian countries shows clearly that a high level of dismissal protection and employment standards is fully compatible with high employment growth; 14. Notes that certain forms of non-standard contracts, depending on how well they are embedded in labour and social security law, as well as the provision of lifelong learning and training opportunities, can contribute both to improving the EU’s economic competitiveness and also to for catering for different needs of workers, bearing in mind the stage of life they are at and their job prospects; at the same time recognises that non-standard forms of work must go hand in hand with support for workers who find themselves in situations of transition from one job to another, or from one employment status to another; also notes that in order to make this transition rapid and sustainable, it is necessary to focus on active intervention allowing workers who re-enter the labour market to be entitled to some level of income support during the period strictly necessary for them to become more employable through training and requalification; 15. Stresses that the Green Paper should focus on labour law itself; 16. Regrets the Commission's focus on individual labour law, and urges the Commission to focus on and promote collective labour law as the means to increase both flexibility and security for workers and employers; 17. Firmly believes that any form of employment, whether non-standard or otherwise, should carry with it a core of rights regardless of the specific employment status, which should include: equal treatment, workers’ health and safety protection and provisions on working/rest time, freedom of association and representation, collective bargaining, collective action, and access to training;at the same time stresses that these matters should be adequately enforced at Member State level, taking into account the different traditions and social and economic circumstances in each country; underlines that European legislation is not in contradiction to national legislation, but should be viewed as complementary; 18. Notes that a fundamental part of labour law in many Member States, and as enshrined in the Treaty, is the right to take collective action, and that the Commission has stated in proceedings before the Court of Justice that the specific form of some Nordic collective actions is in accordance with the EC Treaty, and requests the Commission to respect collective agreements as a specific type of labour law as recognised by the Court of Justice; 19. Requests that all workers have access to the same level of protection and that certain groups are not excluded by default from the broadest level of protection, such as is currently often the case for seafarers, workers on vessels and offshore workers as well as workers in road transport; requests that efficient legislation should apply to all persons regardless of the place where they work; 20. Considers that excessive administrative burdens can deter employers from taking on new workers even during times of
