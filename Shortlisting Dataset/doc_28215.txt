Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (21 October 2010) Following a Commission consultation ‘Consultation of the social partners concerning violence at the workplace and its effects on health and safety at work’ (C/2004/5220 of 17 January 2005). in accordance with Article 154 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), on 26 April 2007 the European social partners BusinessEurope, the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME), the European Centre of Employers and Enterprises (CEEP) and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) concluded a Framework Agreement on harassment and violence at work http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/dsw/public/actRetrieveText.do?id=8446 . The aim of the Agreement, in which the social partners agreed on a ‘description’, not a definition, of harassment, is to increase awareness and understanding of the issue among employers, workers and their representatives, and to provide them with a framework for identifying, preventing and managing problems of harassment and violence at work. Under the Agreement, companies are to adopt a policy of zero tolerance and draw up procedures for dealing with cases of harassment and violence. In accordance with Article 155(2) TFEU, the European social partners opted for an ‘autonomous agreement’, in other words an agreement to be implemented by their member organisations by April 2010 in accordance with the procedures and practices specific to management and labour and the Member States. The Agreement provides that they are to present an implementation report one year after the deadline. The Commission considers that the Agreement contains positive points for preventing all forms of violence and harassment at work. It rightly refers to the EU framework directive on health and safety at work Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1. , which makes it a duty of employers to ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work, and to the EU legislation on combating discrimination and promoting equal treatment of men and women Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22; Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16; Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 15. , which prohibits harassment in connection with discrimination. On the expiry of the deadline for implementation, the Commission will monitor the Agreement to assess the extent to which it has contributed to achieving the Union's objectives. Before evaluating the need for further policy measures in the case in point, the Commission will therefore draw the lessons from the implementation of the European social partners’
