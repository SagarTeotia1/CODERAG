to tackle this problem, Q. whereas Austria has since 2000 changed its national Unfair Commercial Practices Law, and whereas Section 28a thereof now states: “It shall be prohibited to advertise, in the scope of business and for the purpose of competition, for registration in directories, such as yellow pages, telephone directory or similar lists, by way of payment form, money order form, invoice, offer of correction or similar manner or to offer such registrations directly without unequivocally and also by clear and graphic means pointing out that such advertisement is solely an offer for a contract”, R. whereas such practices have been applied for a number of years, creating numerous victims and significantly damaging and distorting the internal market, 1. Expresses its concern at the problem raised by the petitioners, which appears to be widespread and of a cross-border nature and which has a significant financial impact, notably on small businesses; 2. Considers that the cross-border nature of this problem imposes a duty on the Community institutions to provide an adequate remedy to victims, such that the validity of contracts concluded on the basis of misleading advertising can be effectively contested, annulled or terminated, and such that victims may obtain reimbursement of the money paid by them; 3. Urges victims to report cases of business scams to national authorities, and calls on Member States to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with the know-how needed in order to enable them to file complaints with governmental and non-governmental authorities, by ensuring that communication pathways are open and that victims are aware that advice is available so that they can seek appropriate guidance before they settle fees demanded from them by misleading business-directory companies; urges Member States to set up and maintain a centralised database of these complaints; 4. Regrets that, despite the widespread nature of these practices, EU and national legislation does not appear to be adequate when it comes to providing a significant means of protection and an effective remedy, or is not being adequately enforced at national level; regrets that national authorities also seem to be unable to provide a remedy; 5. Welcomes the efforts made by European and national business organisations to raise awareness among their members, and calls on them to intensify their efforts in collaboration with grass-roots organisations so that fewer people become victims of misleading business-directory practices in the first place; expresses concern that some of these organisations have consequently been pursued through the courts by the misleading business-directory companies specified in their awareness-raising activities on the basis of alleged defamation or similar accusations; 6. Welcomes the action taken by certain Member States such as Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom, but most notably by Austria, in trying to prevent business-directory companies from engaging in misleading practices; considers, however, that these efforts remain insufficient and that there is still a need for the coordination of control at an international level; 7. Calls on the Commission and on Member States to step up their efforts, in full cooperation with national and European business representative organisations, to
