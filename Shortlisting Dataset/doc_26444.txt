do with the concept of Wider Europe . On 1 May 2004, the EU will have 10 new members, totalling 25, a population of 451.5 million and new geographic frontiers. Hence new neighbours, new interests and new problems to solve. However, the question "what is Europe" is not a "question for each generation" to define as it was implicitly said in the Agenda 2000 . The EP in both occasions - i.e. Agenda 2000 and Wider Europe - has adopted a broader view of EU interests and options, taking account of its history, commitments and place in an interdependent world. The second reason for paying attention to this proposal is the future Constitutional Treaty. According to the Convention's text, the EU's External Policy will have to be different and its instruments for its pursuit enlarged and deepened. The loans, credit or aid will be different forms of EU assistance to third countries, a necessary complement to pursue an EU external policy. Hence the need to define the EIB's mandate broadly today to take account of tomorrow's needs.

The third reason for considering carefully the proposal is its misconception of Wider Europe. Table 1 shows the various Council Decisions amending the basic Decision 200/24/EC and the ceiling of credits accorded to regions and countries. The draftsman seeks to amend the proposal under consideration, and the justifications added to the proposed amendments make the case for them. The fourth reason is institutional in nature, the decision making procedure. The Council has insisted on having as a legal base a Treaty article that would give power to Council to do "what it deems correct". Hence the EP has always been granted consultation . This means that if the EP gives its opinion (whether it approves, rejects or accepts it with amendments) the Council would be able to dismiss it and decide "whatever it pleases".
