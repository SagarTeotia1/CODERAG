Question for written answer P-010307/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (8 November 2011) Subject: VP/HR — Improper German arms exports to Mexico The German Coordinating Committee for Human Rights in Mexico has detected a sharp jump in arms exports to Mexico since 2007 http://esp.mexiko-koordination.de/component/docman/doc_view/64-diagnostico-exportacion-de-armas-19102011-1.html?Itemid=53 and condemned torture, which is practised widely and systematically and goes unpunished, and the fact that the arbitrary detention of leaders and members of social movements, forced disappearances, the murder of journalists, of which there have been numerous cases, and other human rights violations all occur as a matter of routine. The committee points out that the increase in the quantity of weapons sold is so glaringly obvious that it must be linked to the export licence which the German Government granted in summer 2006 to the German-based company Heckler & Koch. There have been substantial sales to municipal police forces in Chiapas, Chihuahua, Guerrero, and Jalisco. Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP requires Member States to ‘deny an export licence if there is a clear risk that the military technology or equipment to be exported might be used for internal repression’, which, as defined in the Common Position, includes ‘torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, summary or arbitrary executions, disappearances, arbitrary detentions and other major violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms …’. Is the Vice-President/High Representative aware of the above report? Will she take action against Germany for its failure to comply with Criteria Two and Three of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP? Will she take the diplomatic steps required to make Mexico review the current situation and ensure respect for human rights?
