WRITTEN QUESTION E-1022/08 by Giuseppe Gargani (PPE‑DE) and Antonio Tajani (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (29 February 2008) Subject: Ban on exclusive mandates The Italian national laws No 248/2006 (Article 8) and 40/2007 (Article 5) forbid insurance companies to draw up exclusive agency contracts in the field of damage insurance. According to the Italian Government, the aim of this measure is to implement Article 81 of the Treaty and provide an incentive to competition. In reality, legislation of this nature is contrary to Community law and does not exist in any other Member State. In particular, it is in breach of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 1. (Article 3), which states that national legislation cannot outlaw agreements which are not forbidden under Article 81(1) of the Treaty, or which meet the conditions of Article 81(3) or are governed by an exemption regulation. In Community law, Article 81(1) has never applied to agency agreements proper, under which the agent is merely a physical extension of the company with which he forms an indivisible unit (Commission communication of 13 October 2000 — guidelines on vertical restrictions). In any case, vertical agreements are now covered by the exemption regulation No 2790/1999 OJ L 336, 29.12.1999, p. 21. . The breach involved of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 appears particularly grave: with this regulation, the European Council (see Recital 8) has, for the first time, activated Article 83(2)(e) of the Treaty, making it mandatory for national legislation to be in close coordination with the Community competition rules. The Italian law banning exclusive mandates in the field of damage insurance constitutes, therefore, a serious breach of the primacy of Community law and represents an obstacle to the establishment of a European market in insurance. On 13 December 2006, the Italian insurance companies, through their professional association (ANIA), forwarded the Commission a complaint against this legislation. Subsequently, on 12 November 2007 ANIA formally asked the Commission to take a position on the complaint, but no reply has yet been received. Can the Commission state its position on this Italian legislation in relation to EC law, and explain why, after more than a year, ANIA has received no reply to its complaint?
