Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (28 October 2010) Bioenergy is expected to contribute about half of the effort needed to meet the EU's 2020 renewable energy targets. Already today, bioenergy constitutes the largest part of the renewable energy mix, and around 5 % of the final energy consumption is from biomass resources coming from agriculture, forestry and waste. The Commission has received most, but not all, National Renewable Energy Action Plans, and is currently analysing these to form a coherent view of each Member State's plans to develop the sector. The Plans which have been submitted are available at: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/transparency_platform/action_plan_en.htm
