WRITTEN QUESTION E-5292/07 by Sebastiano (Nello) Musumeci (UEN) to the Commission (26 October 2007) Subject: Construction of a regasification plant at Melilli (Sicily) The company ‘Ionio Gas s.r.l.’ has applied for authorisation to build a regasification terminal for liquefied natural gas in the industrial zone of the Sicilian town Melilli. The project consists of three underground tanks with a capacity of about 150000 m ³ each. The plant would be built near the residential centre of the town and in the vicinity of the Megara Iblea archaeological park and the protected area ‘Saline di Priolo’. Italian Law No 741 of 10 December 1981 classified this site as a ‘high seismic risk zone’. In view of the objective danger the construction of the plant poses for the health of the population of Melilli and in view of the fact that Article 23 of decree-law No 334 of 17 August 1999 transposing Directive 96/82/EC OJ L 10, 14.1.1997, p. 13. has not been respected, since the population concerned was not able to offer its opinion, whereas Article 13, paragraph 5, of the directive envisages such a procedure, can the Commission say whether: — it does not consider, in view of the many blatant violations of Community law throughout the procedure and the dangers inherent in the presence of the installation in question, that it should prevail upon the Italian authorities to ban the construction of the regasification plant at Melilli?
