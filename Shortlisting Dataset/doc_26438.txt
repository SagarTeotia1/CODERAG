the 10 acceding countries will no longer be part of these loans and guarantee arrangements as of 1 May 2004. The amount of loans signed with the Accession countries amount € 2 127 million (31 December 2002). 11. It should be said from the start that the revision comprises very significant changes in the regional distribution of the lending ceilings for different countries and/or regions. 12. At present, the total lending mandate (ceiling) which is authorised looks as follows: (€ million) Central&Eastern Europe (CEEC) 9 280 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, FYROM and Rumania + the Accession countries Mediterranean 6 425 Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and Gaza/West-Bank Latin America and Asia 2 480 Countries covered by ALA regulation South Africa 825 Turkey "Customs Union facility" and "Earthquake facility" 1 050 Pursuant to decisions 1997/786/EC and 2000/788/EC Baltic Sea Basin of Russia 100 Northern Dimension, decision 2001/777/EC Total lending mandate 20 060 13. It should be noted that around € 8 000 million worth of loans had actually been signed as of 31 December 2002 (the Commission should provide an update of this figure for 31 December 2003). This means that about 40% of the lending mandate had been used up at that time. 14. With accession, and with this proposal, the Commission now suggests a number of important changes, which are not really illustrated very clearly in the document. The Commission refers mainly to a "new geographical distribution of the current mandate" without really pinpointing the more detailed consequences for the countries covered by the different geographical ceilings. At first sight, these do not seem to change much, but the truth is that considerable changes are proposed. These changes need to be illustrated in a clear manner. 15. Turkey will be moved from the Meda envelope to the CEEC envelope. At the same time, the name of this envelope will be changed to "South Eastern Neighbours". The share of Turkey in the current Meda mandate, to be transferred, is € 2 085 million. This is consistent with the agreement to finance expenditure for Turkey from the pre-accession strategy. 16. To transfer to the Meda envelop all of the additional space under the lending ceiling ("surplus margin"), which will be created when the 10 accession countries are lifted out from the mandate. This additional space or "surplus margin" amounts to € 2 180 million. In what could be seen as a lack of transparency, the Commission refers to this as "to redefine the new lending mandate for Meda...". and only dedicates a few lines to this important issue. The addition to the Meda envelope would be used to reinforce the foreseen lending under the FEMIP facility (Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership). 17. To extend the lending mandate- in line with the Neighbourhood Policy- to Russia and the WNIS, Western New Independent States, (Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus), with a new envelope of € 300 million. A substantial part of this € 300m ( ECOFIN has already adopted conclusions indicating a preference for € 500m)
