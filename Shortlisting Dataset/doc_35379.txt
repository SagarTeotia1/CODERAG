Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (16 January 2012) The economic operators had a long period to comply with the requirements that entered into force on 1 January 2012, and many of them have amended their cages in the meantime. The Commission's role is to ensure that all Member States ensure full compliance by all operators. For this reason, the Commission has already officially contacted all those Member States, which according to the current data, do not seem to be compliant as of 1 January 2012. These investigations may lead to infringement proceedings and referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union. If a Member State is held non-compliant by the Court and does not implement the respective judgment, the Commission shall in a second referral to the Court, under Article 260 of the Treaty, specify the amount of a lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by the Member States concerned which it considers appropriate in the circumstances. If the Court finds that the Member States concerned have not complied with its judgment it may impose a lump sum or penalty payment on it. Eggs produced in non-compliant systems are illegal as of 1 January 2012. The Commission has repeatedly discussed with Member States actions to achieve compliance Article 11 describes the Comitology procedures applicable to implement Directive 1999/74/EC or to modify non-essential elements thereof. Directive 1999/74/EC does not provide any powers to the Commission to introduce a specific sanctioning system for the failure to introduce un-enriched cages.
