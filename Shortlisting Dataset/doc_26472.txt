{ "context": [ [ "Mirror support cell", [ "In astronomy, a mirror support cell - more commonly mirror cell - is a component of a reflecting telescope that supports the mirror in place to hold optical alignment, allow collimation adjustment, and protect it from falling out.", " The common usage of the word denotes the cell that holds the primary mirror (M1), however technically it could also be used to denote the support assembly (usually called a \"spider\" or \"strut\") for the secondary mirror (M2) or other mirrors." ] ], [ "Curved mirror", [ "A curved mirror is a mirror with a curved reflecting surface.", " The surface may be either \"convex\" (bulging outward) or \"concave\" (bulging inward).", " Most curved mirrors have surfaces that are shaped like part of a sphere, but other shapes are sometimes used in optical devices.", " The most common non-spherical type are parabolic reflectors, found in optical devices such as reflecting telescopes that need to image distant objects, since spherical mirror systems, like spherical lenses, suffer from spherical aberration.", " One advantage that mirror optics have over lens optics is that mirrors do not introduce chromatic aberration." ] ], [ "Dielectric mirror", [ "A dielectric mirror, also known as a Bragg mirror, is a type of mirror composed of multiple thin layers of dielectric material, typically deposited on a substrate of glass or some other optical material.", " By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, one can design an optical coating with specified reflectivity at different wavelengths of light.", " Dielectric mirrors are also used to produce ultra-high reflectivity mirrors: values of 99.999% or better over a narrow range of wavelengths can be produced using special techniques.", " Alternatively, they can be made to reflect a broad spectrum of light, such as the entire visible range or the spectrum of the Ti-sapphire laser.", " Mirrors of this type are very common in optics experiments, due to improved techniques that allow inexpensive manufacture of high-quality mirrors.", " Examples of their applications include laser cavity end mirrors, hot and cold mirrors, thin-film beamsplitters, and the coatings on modern mirrorshades." ] ], [ "Integrated Science Instrument Module", [ "Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) is a component of the James Webb Space Telescope, a large international infrared space telescope planned for launch in 2018.", " ISIM is the heart of the JWST, and holds the main science payload which includes four science instruments and the fine guidance sensor.", " ISIM is the spacecraft chassis and instruments that take the light from the main mirror and convert that into the science data that is then sent back to Earth.", " The other two major sections of the JWST are the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) (mirror and their structure) and the Spacecraft Element (SE), which includes the Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield.", " ISIM has a mass of 1.4 metric tons (tonnes) (1.54 US tons).", " The infrared camera instrument integrated with ISIM passed its thermal tests in early 2016.", " ISIM underwent intense thermal cold testing in
