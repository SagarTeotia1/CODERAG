Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (19 December 2005) The Commission is examining complaints by licensed gambling operators and other service providers against a number of Member States including the ones that the Honourable Member had referred to in his question. The Commission will make every effort to process them in a timely manner. In relation to the meeting of the College of Commissioners on 12 October 2005, the Honourable Member is correct in noting that infringement complaints relating to gambling were not considered on that occasion.
