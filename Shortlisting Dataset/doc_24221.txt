Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (11 May 2011) The Commission has been aware of the issue of cigarette smuggling in the Member States, including Romania, and the issue of external border controls in this matter, especially at the eastern border. Smuggling of cigarettes is a global phenomenon, requiring global solutions. The fight against this type of fraud is a shared responsibility and requires actions at all levels, i.e. from the Commission, the Member States and the neighbouring countries. On the Commission’s side, it would refer the Honourable Member to its replies to previous parliamentary questions, in particular Questions E‑11191/10 by Mr Obermayr, E‑0583/11 by Mr Karas and E‑1503/11 by Mr Dess http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/home.do?language=EN which detail the actions of the Commission. In particular, the Commission is examining additional actions to tackle illicit trade in cigarettes at the EU’s external borders, in close cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member States. The focus will be on additional measures supporting enforcement capacity, strengthening the disincentives to smuggle and raising awareness about the consequences, strengthening operational cooperation, including shared intelligence, and enhancing international cooperation, especially at the eastern border.
