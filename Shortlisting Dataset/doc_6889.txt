relevant are the abovementioned Directives 89/391/EEC and 98/24/EC, for which Germany has communicated to the Commission national transposing measures. In implementation of Directive 98/24/EC, the Commission has adopted Directive 2000/39/EC of 8 June 2000 establishing a first list of indicative occupational exposure limit values OJ L 142, 16.6.2000 . . It should be noted that, for these indicative occupational exposure limit values, Member States shall establish national occupational exposure limit values, taking into account the Community limit value, determining its nature in accordance with national legislation and practice. Directive 2000/39/EC contains some limit values on organic chemicals, some of which may be volatile compounds. These limit values are however higher than 200 micro grams. A full list of EU occupational exposure limit values can be found on the website of the Commission at http://europa.eu.int/comm/employment_social/health_safety/docs/oels_en.pdf It is up to the Member States to ensure adequate controls and supervision of national transposing measures. This control and supervision is, in the case of occupational health and safety legislation, normally carried out through the national labour inspectorates or other bodies with similar responsibilities regarding specific problems or sectors of activity. Also, it should be highlighted that national courts can be seized as regards the application of national health and safety legislation according to existing national procedures. Within this context, the rules on burden of proof fall within the competences of the Member States. The Commission is not aware of any such limit value, as the one to which the Honourable Member refers, in the EU environmental legislation nor does the Commission have any plans to establish such a limit value for the time being.
