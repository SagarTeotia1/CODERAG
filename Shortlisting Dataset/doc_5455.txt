2002/C 205 E/275 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1016/02 by Dirk Sterckx (ELDR) to the Commission (8 April 2002) Subject: Application of the strawberry regulation to France's obstruction of rail freight transport through the Channel Tunnel Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 OJ L 337, 12.12.1998, p. 8 . , the so-called strawberry regulation , provides for a number of measures in response to serious obstacles to the free movement of goods in a Member State. France has been obstructing the free movement of goods by rail through the Channel Tunnel for months now. What measures has France taken to comply with its obligations under this regulation? Has France taken all necessary and proportionate measures to put an end to this unacceptable obstruction of the free movement of goods? Bearing in mind the Commission's relatively adverse assessment of this regulation, does it not regard the regulation as inadequate, and would it not be appropriate to tighten up its provisions so that in future such situations as this one, which undermine the principle of the internal market, can be remedied more quickly?
