Question for written answer E-007849/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Catherine Stihler (S&D) (31 August 2011) Subject: Formula 1 moving to pay-per-view Formula 1 broadcasting in the UK is about to switch from terrestrial broadcasting that is free for all to all races being broadcast on a Sky TV pay service and only at most half of the races being shown for free on the BBC. Can the Commission comment on whether there is any legislation to prevent Formula 1 being broadcast on a paid platform?
