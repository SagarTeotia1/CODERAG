Question for written answer E-012005/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kathleen Van Brempt (S&D) (16 December 2011) Subject: Reducing catches of seabirds in fishing gear The European Commission has been preparing a communication on an EU action plan for reducing catches of seabirds in fishing gear. In its answer to Question E‑008118/2011, the Commission stated that it intended to adopt this communication in December 2011, i.e. by the end of this month. Can the Commission confirm that this deadline will still be met? Article 5 of the Birds Directive places an obligation on Member States to take ‘the requisite measures to establish a general system of protection’ for all seabird species naturally occurring in EU waters. Article 5(a) in turn requires Member States to prohibit ‘deliberate killing or capture by any method’, i.e. including deliberate killing or capture in fishing gear. The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that the term ‘deliberate’ as used in the equivalent provision of the Habitats Directive includes not only intentional killing or capture but also those cases where there has been mere acceptance of the possibility of killing or capture Case C‑221/04 Commission v Spain [2006] ECR I‑4515, paragraph 71. . It is logical that this broad interpretation should also apply to the term ‘deliberate’ as used in Article 5(a) of the Birds Directive and hence that killing or capture of seabirds in fishing gear must be prohibited even where such killing or capture is unintentional and instead arises merely because the person committing the act has accepted the ‘possibility’ of its happening. Given the EU’s exclusive competence in the area of fisheries conservation, can the Commission confirm that the objective of the forthcoming communication on seabird by-catch will be in line with the high level of protection granted to seabirds under Article 5, including Article 5(a) in particular, of the Birds Directive?
