WRITTEN QUESTION E-6126/09 by Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) to the Council (8 December 2009) Subject: EU subsidies for mining Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002 on state aid to the coal industry expires on 31 December 2010. The European Union has, on various occasions, acknowledged its dependency on energy sources from outside its borders. On 29 November 2000, the Commission approved a note referring to the Green Paper ‘Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply’ to promote indigenous energy sources, especially those required for generating electricity. In Spain today, more than 10 000 people are employed directly, and 30 000 indirectly, in jobs linked to coal production, particularly in Asturias and in Castilla and León. The sector has been modernised in recent years to cut CO 2 emissions through research into clean coal burning. Spain has a CO 2 capture plant in León. Coal is the only primary source of fossil energy that is plentiful in Europe. Bearing in mind that coal is considered as a strategic sector: Is the Council planning to retain mining sector subsidies? Since the reasons behind Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002 still exist, is the Council planning to prolong this regulation? What action has the Council taken to ensure that a sector on which thousands of jobs depend continues to receive assistance? What specific measures is the Council thinking of adopting to ensure that the European Union is self-sufficient as regards its energy supply? What has been done to promote the consumption of indigenous coal?
