Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (21 March 2002) The Spanish authorities have sent the Commission an application for part-financing from the Cohesion Fund for a project for a centre for the treatment of solid urban waste ( Centro de Tratamiento de Residuos Urbanos de Gomecello ) in the province of Salamanca. The Commission recently received the further information it had requested from the national authorities, concerning in particular whether or not an environmental impact assessment had been carried out in accordance with Council Directive 97/11/EC amending Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 . . The Commission will take no decision on part-financing until it has thoroughly considered this information. The Commission would also point out that, under Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 establishing a Cohesion Fund OJ L 130, 25.5.1994 , as amended by Regulations (EC) Nos 1264/1999 and 1265/1999, OJ L 161, 26.6.1999 . , any project receiving part-financing from the Fund must comply with Community law, including law on the protection of the environment. The facts referred to by the Honourable Member do not enable the Commission to assess compliance with the obligations imposed by Council Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment OJ L 158, 23.6.1990 . . It would also point out that citizens' rights in this respect are protected by national law on freedom of information.
