Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (28 January 2009) The Honourable Member requests the Commission to confirm or to deny reports that the Irish Government has offered to buy millions of euros of wasted pork stocks from processing plants, in light of the recent dioxin scare, and to comment upon whether such a move would be in keeping with the EU rules on state aid and competitiveness. At the last European Council of 11 and 12 December 2008, the Council invited the Commission to support farmers and slaughterhouses in Ireland by way of co-financed measures to remove relevant animals and products from the market. On 17 December 2008, Ireland submitted a notification concerning special measures relating to meat products of animal origin from pigs following the dioxin contamination in Ireland. The Commission examined this notification in the light of the applicable EU state aid rules, and in particular in the light of Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty concerning aid designed to make good damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences. In this context, the Irish authorities gave their assurances that no overcompensation would be granted to the beneficiaries of the measure. The decision authorising this state aid scheme was adopted on 24 December 2008. In addition to the support granted under the above state aid scheme, the costs of the purchase and destruction of the stocks of the primary producers will be co-financed under Art.191 of Council Regulation 1234/2007 OJ L 299, 16.11.2007. . In particular, the draft regulation states that the Community shall provide part-financing equivalent to 50 % of the expenditure for the disposal of i.a. fresh, chilled or frozen pig meat coming from animals slaughtered no later than 6 December 2008 in Ireland and which is stored in Ireland either in the slaughterhouse, or outside the slaughterhouse under the responsibility and the control of the slaughterhouse.
