sum to former employees instead of preserving their rights. This sum should be equivalent to the value of the vested pension rights and should be paid to the worker as long as it does not exceed the threshold established by the Member State. Gradual improvement of the transferability of vested pension rights The Parliament took a more cautious approach to the transferability of pension rights and spoke against the Commission's proposal to include this right into the new directive. The Commission proposed that workers should be able to transfer their vested rights to their new employer. In some countries like Spain and Finland a transfer of occupational pension rights is currently not possible at all. In others such as Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Sweden transfer is internally possible, but cross-border transfer might be hindered by taxation rules or is totally forbidden by law in order to prevent tax evasion. MEPs state that when introducing new supplementary pension schemes, Member States should endeavour to gradually improve the transferability of vested pension rights. They also ask the Commission to draw up a report, no later than five years after the directive takes effect, on the conditions for transferring capital representing workers' supplementary pension rights. This report should be the basis for proposing any amendments to this directive. 20070615IPR07896 Freedom of movement of persons, social protection: improve the portability of supplementary pension rights in order to facilitate worker mobility Text, as adopted by the EP on 20 June, will shortly be available here EN 1 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5283092 EN 2 LINK /activities/expert/ta/calendar.do?language=EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
