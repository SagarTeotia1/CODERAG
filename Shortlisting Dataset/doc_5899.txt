Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (21 May 2008) The Commission would like to stress the importance that all clinical trials, irrespective of where they are conducted, comply with the ethical principles enshrined in Community legislation. It is committed to promoting the same high level of protection of subjects participating in clinical trials, wherever they are done. 1 and 2. The Commission confirms, as outlined in its answers to the previous Written Questions E‑1805/06 and E‑0777/07 by Mr van den Berg and E‑2357/07 by Mrs Corbey and Mr van den Berg, that medicinal products reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) can be granted a marketing authorisation by the Commission only if they are based on clinical trials conducted in compliance with the requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC Directive 2001/20/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, OJ L 121, 1.5.2001. and related implementing legislation. Article 3 of Commission Directive 2005/28/EC Commission Directive 2005/28/EC of 8 April 2005 laying down principles and detailed guidelines for good clinical practice as regards investigational medicinal products for human use, as well as the requirements for authorisation of the manufacturing or importation of such products, OJ L 91, 9.4.2005. , in particular, lays down that clinical trials shall be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. Article 8 subparagraph 3 (ib) of Directive 2001/83/EC Directive 2001/83/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 311, 28.11.2001. also requires a statement by the applicant to the effect that clinical trials carried out outside the European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. This statement includes a list of the trials involved, the countries where they were carried out and the ethical standards on the basis of which they were conducted. Consequently, results from clinical trials that do not meet these requirements cannot be legally used by an applicant to justify its application for a marketing authorisation. Similarly, marketing authorisations may be suspended or revoked where any infringement of the EU requirements on clinical trials is discovered. Community legislation already provides for a number of control mechanisms to verify compliance with Directive 2001/20/EC, such as penalties and inspections. For example, Commission Regulation (EC) No 658/2007 Commission Regulation (EC) No 658/2007 of 14 June 2007 concerning financial penalties for infringement of certain obligations in connection with marketing authorisations granted under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of Parliament and of the Council, OJ L 155, 15.6.2007. foresees, for medicinal products authorised by the Community, financial penalties in case of infringements of various obligations, including failure to comply with clinical trials requirements. Sites where clinical trials are conducted — including in third countries — can be inspected by the competent authorities of Member States. The EMEA
