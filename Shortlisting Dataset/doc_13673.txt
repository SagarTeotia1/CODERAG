December; the other on Friday 12 December. Commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol for reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions run to 2012. It is the EU's aim to ensure that the Poznan Conference will mark an important step in building a post-2012 framework on climate protection. The Conference, hosted by the Government of Poland, will bring together representatives of over 190 countries, along with observers from intergovernmental and nongovernmental organisations. 09:00 19:00 Poznan, Poland Other events Seminar for journalists on the Working Time Directive The proposed revision of existing legislation on working time takes into account recent case law from the European Court of Justice regarding on-call time. It mainly concerns derogations to the applications of the maximum weekly working time and the possibility not to apply these limits if the worker agrees to opt-out (a clause used mainly in the UK). The seminar, organised by the European Parliament's press service, takes place a few days before the debate in plenary and in the middle of negotiations with Council aiming for a compromise. After the vote in plenary, if no agreement is reached, a third phase of this co-decision procedure is launched: - conciliation, which implies further negotiations over a few weeks and is the last chance to reach agreement. The aim of this seminar is to exchange views between Members of Parliament and journalists on the revision of the working time directive, so participants can explore the political views on this issue and better understand how decisions are taken in the European Union.
