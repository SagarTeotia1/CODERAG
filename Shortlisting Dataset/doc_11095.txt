Answer given by the Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (17 February 2012) Since 2011 there have been important improvements in the seismic network. In particular, the sea level network has been improved in several countries, including France, Italy, Portugal, Greece and Turkey. In order to complete full coverage of the Mediterranean Sea, it would be necessary to add at least 20-30 tidal level gauges which would be distributed in the areas most lacking them. There are currently about 100 sea level gauges in the North-eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean area (http://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org/map.php). Unesco has the overall coordinating role and Member States are responsible for setting up national tsunami warning centres, including a sufficiently wide network of online sea level monitoring systems. The Commission contributes to Unesco's efforts of setting up the North East Atlantic and Mediterranean Tsunami Early Warning System (NEAMTWS) by financially supporting the establishment of 3 seismic sensors in Tunisia, and will continue in 2012 by financially supporting the establishment of three new sea level sensors in locations to be identified in close cooperation with Unesco. At the moment there is no deep sea level measurement or GPS measurement available in real time for operational purposes.
