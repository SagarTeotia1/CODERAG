PRESS KIT EUROPEAN COUNCIL 8-9 DECEMBER Institutions 2011-12-09 - 09:28 John SCHRANZ BXL (+32) 2 28 44264 STR (+33) 3 881 74076 PORT (+32) 498 98 14 02 EMAIL econ-press@europarl.europa.eu With the Eurozone crisis looming larger than ever, the European Parliament will be looking ahead to the coming months with apprehension, but also a determination to play an active role in efforts to emerge from the crisis and build a more sustainable economic system for the future, based on democratic procedures. Parliament will be scrutinising the discussions on a fiscal compact and any possible changes to the Treaty very closely. Over the coming months, a large majority in Parliament will push for changes which preserve the EU of 27 and strive to ensure that they are carried out in accordance with Community law. It will also be keen to see that any actions initially taking place outside the EU Treaty will be integrated into EU law at a later stage. New Treaties and treaty change will not be a silver bullet. Many other areas require a serious rethink, and as in 2011, Parliament will be pushing for reforms which produce credibility. Over the coming months Parliament, as a co-legislator, will be heavily involved in shaping the latest proposals from the Commission on extra budgetary surveillance, and credit rating agencies, among others. Work on these proposals has already begun in Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee under the stewardship of Jean Paul GAUZÈS (EPP, FR) and Elisa FERREIRA (S&D, PT) for the two budgetary surveillance proposals and Leonardo DOMENICI (S&D, IT) for that on credit rating agencies. The three draft reports are scheduled to be presented in February. Parliament will also be giving its opinion on the Commission proposals on Eurobonds (rapporteur: Sylvie GOULARD (ALDE, FR)) and a financial transaction tax (rapporteur: Anni PODIMATA (S&D, EL)). 2012 will also be the first year in which the "six pack" economic governance rules begin to bite. These rules were considerably strengthened thanks to Parliament, which for many months battled with attempts of certain Member States to water down the procedures for enforcing sanctions. Parliament also was in the driving seat when it came to increasing the transparency of the new economic governance system and the accountability of the various players involved. As the events of recent weeks show, much more needs to be done to improve democratic accountability and Parliament will continue to be in the front line of fighting for this.
