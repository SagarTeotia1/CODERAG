Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2012) State aid procedures are governed by the Council Regulation No 659/1999 OJ L 83, 27.3.1999, p. 1 . It is the duty of Member States to duly notify to the Commission any aid that they intend to grant and to collaborate with the Commission and provide all the necessary information for its investigation. The Commission can receive information from any interested party and have a series of contacts with a number of parties after the opening of an in-depth investigation. However the Commission addresses its decision only to the Member State granting the aid. In the case of Dexia, three Member States (Belgium, France and Luxembourg) were subjects of the state aid investigation. For Belgium, the interlocutor of the Commission was not Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene but rather representatives of the Belgian government. The Commission services have had regular contacts at technical level with the Belgian authorities and their representatives, as is the case for any state aid investigation. In addition, Commissioner Kroes had direct contacts with the Belgian Finance Minister Mr Reynders as well as with the French Finance Minister Ms Lagarde. In the latest stage of the procedure C 9/2009, which led to the Commission decision of 26 February 2010 OJ L 274, 19.10.2010, p. 54. , she had a meeting with Mr Reynders (in January 2010) and two telephone calls with Ms Lagarde (in February 2010). She also had two telephone contacts with Mr Dehaene Member of the European Parliament. , (December 2009, February 2010) and briefly met him in the European Parliament in January 2010. Discussions between Commissioner Kroes and Mr Dehaene did not substitute for the official procedural channels with Belgium, and Belgian representatives were fully aware of these informal discussions. Commissioner Kroes also had a meeting with the European Workers Council of Dexia in February 2010. There are no minutes of the telephone conversations between Commissioner Kroes and Mrs Lagarde and Mr Dehaene.
