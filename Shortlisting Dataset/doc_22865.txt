agreements 16. Considers the conclusion and effective implementation of comprehensive, ambitious and balanced EU-Latin America partnership agreements fostering respect for the human, economic and social rights of the population and mutual sustainable development as well as a reduction in social inequalities, as a complement to WTO multilateralism, to be a strategic objective in an international context marked by ever-greater interdependence and by economic growth and the emergence of new economic powers and a growing number of challenges at world level; 17. Proposes, accordingly, that in the economic and commercial field the creation of the Euro-Latin American global interregional partnership area should be based on a model which is compatible with both the WTO and regionalism, to be applied in two stages: (a) a first stage involving the conclusion, at the earliest opportunity, of the negotiations on the EU-Mercosur, EU-Andean Community and EU-Central America Interregional Partnership Agreement and the deepening of the existing EU-Mexico and EU-Chile agreements; (b) a second stage, to be completed in 2012, involving the conclusion of a global interregional partnership agreement ensuring legal and institutional support and full geographical coverage for the various strands of the strategic partnership and providing for the free movement of persons and biregional trade through a deepening of both the integration agreements within Latin America and the Union's partnership process with all countries and regional groupings; 18.

Calls on the Lima Summit for this Agenda to include the adoption of a limited number of clear, firm and verifiable undertakings in all these areas that are liable in themselves to lend fresh impetus to the Strategic Partnership and substantially to improve the living standards of its citizens on both sides of the Atlantic; recommends that specific attention be paid to reducing social inequalities and to integrating groups that are in a marginal social position and lacking in opportunities, and first and foremost indigenous communities; 20. Considers it fundamental for the two regions to include the objective of social cohesion in a permanent, cohesive and practical manner in all their joint initiatives and programmes; maintains that the Euro-Latin American partners are engaged in a common project in which a market economy and social cohesion should not be opposing forces but should complement each other; 21. Recommends that the Lima Agenda for the eradication of poverty, inequality and exclusion include specific measures such as: – joint actions towards the common objective of achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015; – use of the Financial Instrument for Development Cooperation in a manner tailored to the real needs on the ground, with this mainly concerning those emerging and middle-income countries for which cooperation in the areas of technology, higher education and innovation, and economic cooperation, is of particular importance; – the gradual use of resources under the EU Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights for assistance and
