Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (21 April 2006) A European directive Council Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic, OJ L 235, 17.9.1996. sets the maximum authorised weights in international traffic. A Member State may not reject or prohibit, for reasons relating to their weights, vehicles in international traffic complying with the limit values specified by the directive. The weight limits range from 18 tonnes to 44 tonnes, depending on vehicle configurations. The directive also sets the maximum authorised single non-driving axle weight to 10 tonnes. The directive does not prevent Member States from imposing different limits for domestic traffic only, or lower limits to the weights and/or dimensions of vehicles on certain roads or civil engineering structures irrespective of the state of registration of such vehicles. This weight limitation, to which the Honourable Member may refer, is geographically limited and does not, as a rule, concern the major European or national trunk routes. Therefore, the Commission does not hold the opinion that such limitations, important to maintain the safety of infrastructures, have a noticeably negative effect on transport efficiency or emissions. The Commission does not intend to propose an amendment to the directive for the time being.
