Question for written answer E-006593/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) and Oriol Junqueras Vies (Verts/ALE) (4 July 2011) Subject: Monitoring the state of Galician zoos The Commission's answer to Question E‑000172/2011 on keeping animals in zoos does not appear to properly address the matter raised, or only partially, since it only mentions cetaceans. In its answer the Commission does, however, say that it is willing to examine any possible failures of transposition or implementation of Council Directive 1999/22/EC on zoos, particularly in relation to the licensing and inspection of such establishments. Have the Spanish Government or the regional authorities provided any details concerning this matter? Does the Commission intend to request more detailed information? What type of evidence does the Commission require?
