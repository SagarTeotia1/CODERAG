ORAL QUESTION H-0109/05 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Bairbre de Brún to the Council Subject: Electronic bugging of MEPs' offices As the Council should be aware, a sophisticated covert listening device was recently discovered in my constituency office in Belfast, and the British media reports that an admission has been made that this device was placed with the authorisation of British Intelligence. Does the Council think that Member States acting in such a manner are showing due regard for democratic principles and the integrity of this institution? Does the Council accept that the constituency offices of Members of this House merit the same respect as offices based in the institutions? Will the Council give its opinion on the ethics of a listening device being planted inside offices that I use and also contact the British Government about this incident?
