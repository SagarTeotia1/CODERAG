Answer given by Mrs Fischer-Boel on behalf of the Commission (26 August 2005) The Commission takes note of the Honourable Member’s statement that he did not make any kind of accusation against a Commission official in his Oral Question H-0341/05 Answer given on 10 May 2005. . The framework for the sensitive mobility policy of the Commission was originally laid down in the Commission decisions describing Internal Control Standard No 5 of 13 December 2000 and 18 December 2001. The guidelines for how this control standard should be implemented were outlined in September 2003 and were as follows: Post occupied for more than seven years at 31 December 2003 — financial post: mandatory mobility by 31 December 2003 — other sensitive posts: mandatory mobility by 30 September 2004 Post occupied for more than five years at 31 December 2004 and thereafter — all posts: mandatory mobility by the end of the relevant calendar year. The official in question was transferred to a post in the Agriculture and Rural Development DG (DG AGRI.C.3) (Common market organisation for olive oil, textile plants and sugar) on 16 May 2002. This post, dealing with technical and economic matters concerning agro-monetary questions, outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, was considered sensitive and therefore subject to compulsory mobility by 31 December 2007. Meanwhile, the official in question has already moved, having left DG AGRI on 16 June 2005 to go to DG ADMIN (Administrative affairs, audit and anti-fraud) following an application in January 2005, well in advance of the five year benchmark. Before 16 May 2002, the official in question was a legal adviser within DG AGRI.B.1 (Agricultural law). Legal advisers are not considered sensitive posts by DG AGRI since their tasks are limited to giving legal opinions. However, in this specific case, the official in question was assigned to this post for just under five years and, as such, within the benchmark range which subsequently became applicable. In implementing Control Standard 5, the Commission would like to assure the Honourable Member that it applies a very broad definition of sensitivity covering not only financial and appointing powers, but also access to sensitive information, influence on decisions, contacts outside Commission and exposure to pressure.
