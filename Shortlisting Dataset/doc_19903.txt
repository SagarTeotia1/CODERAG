Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2011) Strong support for the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a central element of the European Union’s policy towards the western Balkans. The Tribunal was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 (1993) for ‘the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia’ . Through its essential contribution to justice in the conflicts of former Yugoslavia, the Tribunal has been instrumental in the restoration of peace and a pre-condition for a lasting reconciliation in the region. The tribunal performs its mandate according to the highest standards of international law and in full transparency. A wealth of information and the full proceedings of the ongoing Trial of Radovan Karadzic can be easily accessed on the Tribunals website www.icty.org. The trial commenced on 26 October 2009. On 1 and 2 March 2010, the accused made his opening statement and the Prosecution began presenting evidence on 13 April 2010. It is estimated that the prosecution case will be completed between the end of December 2011 and mid‑April 2012. The Commission does not comment on the proceedings of a United Nations Tribunal.
