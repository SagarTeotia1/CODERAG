sets out to clean up production processes by proposing solvent emission reduction plans as an alternative method of compliance to the conventional use of pollution abatement equipment. The Commission therefore proposes to introduce maximum limits for the use of solvents in specific categories of coatings, in two phases (2007/2010) so as to reduce total VOC emissions by 295 kilotonnes by 2010, for the two sectors taken together (decorative paints and vehicle refinishing). Rapporteur's position The rapporteur welcomes the Commission's proposal, which is based on overriding considerations of environmental protection and public health protection for European citizens, to which the EU has a duty to respond; the proposal is part of a comprehensive body of legislation (National emission ceilings and IPPC). Your rapporteur also welcomes the efforts made by this sector of industry to reduce voluntarily the quantities of solvents required to produce coatings. This effort, prompted by the industry's awareness of environmental concerns and by market forces, has brought about a situation in which today approximately 70% of decorative paints are water-based. In view of the complex nature of the chemical processes resulting in the creation of tropospheric ozone and the need to take a broad view of this issue, the rapporteur would like to draw attention to the following points: - a targeted measure of this kind by the Commission should take greater account of the present and future technical feasibility required to achieve the targets set, all the more so when the major risk is that VOC emissions might be increased rather than reduced; - the question of technical feasibility is closely linked to that of paint quality, particularly for a number of specific applications which have not only a decorative but also a protective role for wood and metal and are used for both private and public purposes; - quality is determined by long-term resistance to weather and contact with human beings or machines. Over a given period of time, reducing paint quality as defined above would involve increasing the number of applications required to ensure its protective and decorative functions; - in terms of quality there is a point at which reducing the quantity of solvents for most categories of coatings covered by the scope of the directive becomes counterproductive, creating a serious risk of causing an increase in VOC emissions, which is exactly the opposite of what the present proposal sets out to achieve; - the hoped-for shift to water-based paints does not completely solve the environmental problems as these products contain other substances with a not insignificant environmental impact, for example anti-bacterials, precisely because the quality is not up to the standard of solvent-based paints. Consequently, the problem will not be resolved but merely displaced. Amendments Your rapporteur therefore proposes seven amendments designed to clarify various definitions contained in the directive; these concern industrial practices (amendments 2 and 3), existing international or Community law (amendments 6, 8, 11) and the correction of technical errors in the Commission proposal (amendments 9 and 10). In line with the argument set out in this explanatory statement, the rapporteur has
