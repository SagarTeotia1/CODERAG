Question for written answer E-000201/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (18 January 2012) Subject: Reasons for the failure to complete the 2007 and 2008 annual programmes addressing illegal immigration in Greece According to the Commission’s reply to my previous question (E‑010361/2011) concerning the take-up rate of European funds to deal with illegal immigration in Greece, it would appear that the first annual programmes, for 2007 and 2008, have not yet been completed. The Commission, therefore, is not in a position to evaluate the overall level of implementation of programmes and the general take-up rate of funds by Greece. Will the Commission answer the following: 1. What are the reasons for the serious delay in closing the first annual programmes for 2007 and 2008? When are they expected to be completed? 2. Does the Commission consider that this delay will impact on the take-up of Community funds for immigration in Greece and on the implementation of projects under the 2011 and 2012 annual programmes?
