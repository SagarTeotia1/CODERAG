Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (22 June 2009) The Commission recommendation Commission recommendation of 17 January 2001 on the maximum permitted blood alcohol content for drivers of motorised vehicles (OJ L 43, 14.2.2001, p. 31). on combating drink-driving provides in particular for close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States to ensure that the Member States forward data on all alcohol-related road accidents. The use of these data is then coordinated within the framework of the CARE http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/observatory/statistics/care_en.htm (Community Road Accident Database) programme to monitor the effectiveness of road safety policy. Increasing and improving data collection in the Member States will therefore undoubtedly contribute towards achieving the goal in question. Moreover, one of the five priority themes of the Commission's Alcohol Strategy, adopted in 2006, was the need to reduce injuries and deaths from alcohol-related road traffic accidents. The introduction and enforcement of frequent and systematic random breath testing was highlighted in the strategy as an example of good practice. Nonetheless, the adoption of the Irish Bill to make alcohol and drug testing at the scene of accidents compulsory is the sole responsibility of the Irish Government.
