Question for written answer E-009949/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (7 November 2011) Subject: Neglected diseases carried by illegal migrants According to the KEELPNO (Infection Control and Disease Prevention Centre), almost one in two illegal migrants (47 %) is suffering from tuberculosis, which had at one stage been eradicated in Greece but is now severely affecting its illegal migrant community. A very high percentage (35.29 %) of migrants are infected with hepatitis B. Numerous illegal migrants (60 %) in the Evros area have been diagnosed as suffering from typhoid fever, which is highly infectious, being transmitted rapidly through food and drink. KEELPNO specialists describe illegal migrants as ‘walking time bombs’ in public health terms, being highly mobile and likely to transmit illnesses to broad swathes of the population. Malaria is now increasingly taking hold in Greece, a total of 57 cases having been registered by the centre since the beginning of the year, half of them in the last three months. The report goes on to point out that this is the first time since the disease was eradicated in Greece (1974) that so many cases of malaria have been recorded among Greek citizens, including those who have never travelled to areas in which it is endemic. 25 migrants suffering from malaria have been registered by the centre (18 from Pakistan, five from Romania, one from Afghanistan and one from Morocco). In view of this: — Has technical assistance been sought from the Commission in dealing with this threat to the Greek population? — Will it take account of this particular situation in connection with the projected migrant centres? — What action does it advise the Greek Health Ministry to take in order to contain the problem effectively?
