WRITTEN QUESTION P-1052/09 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (17 February 2009) Subject: Tackling the financial and economic crisis Like other parts of the world, Europe is affected by an unprecedented financial and economic crisis. Everywhere, plans are being launched with the aim of restoring confidence in the financial system and its functioning. Some of these plans tend towards protectionism, which gives rise to the following questions. 1. What measures will the Commission take to identify and, where appropriate, combat protectionist measures by third countries which restrict European export opportunities in violation of WTO or other agreements? 2. What measures will the Commission take to examine the recovery plans of the Member States or their regions and, inter alia , to combat state aid which distorts competition? 3. Does the Commission recognise the danger posed by multinationals if they play off against one another the various EU Member States where they operate? What measures is the Commission planning to combat distortion of the internal market due to national recovery measures?
