Question for written answer E-010178/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Elżbieta Katarzyna Łukacijewska (PPE) (8 November 2011) Subject: Bee health projects under the seventh framework programme The EU is providing support under the seventh framework programme for projects focusing on the health of honey bees and other pollinating insects. One of the aims of the Bee Doc, Cleanhive and STEP projects and the Coloss COST action is to develop new diagnostic tools, with a view to mitigating the decline of the bee population. Can the Commission say: — how much funding has been allocated to these projects; — how Poland compares with the other Member States as regards implementation of the projects?
