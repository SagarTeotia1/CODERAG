Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2008) Infringement proceedings No 2006/0780 related to Ireland's failure to notify measures by 18 August 2006 for the transposition into national law of Council Directive 2003/72/EC. The directive was transposed into Irish Law as the ‘European Communities (European Cooperative Society) (Employee Involvement) Regulations 2007 (SI No 259 of 2007)’ and the implementing measures were notified to the Commission on 7 June 2007. As a result, the proceedings against Ireland were terminated and the infringement case was closed by the Commission on 11 December 2007.
