Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (14 December 2011) 1. In accordance with the information available to the Commission, an epidemic of African swine fever is ongoing in the South-Western part of Russia. 2. The Commission shares the concerns on the disease situation in Russia. In relation to this, the Commission has adopted Decision 2011/78/EU Commission Decision 2011/78/EU of 3 February 2011 on certain measures to prevent the transmission of the African swine fever virus from Russia to the Union, OJ L 30, 4.2.2011. , which foresees that vehicles used for transport of pigs into Russia and re-entering the Union from Russia have to be cleansed and disinfected. 3. The Commission has also raised this issue with the Member States' competent authorities on several occasions, to ensure that reinforced controls are put in place at the EU borders to prevent any possible African swine fever virus introduction, and asked them to rehearse all the mechanisms foreseen in the EU legislation Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down specific provisions for the control of African swine fever and amending Directive 92/119/EEC as regards Teschen disease and African swine fever, OJ L 192, 20.7.2002; Commission Decision 2003/422/EC of 26 May 2003 approving an African swine fever diagnostic manual, OJ L 143, 11.6.2003. in case of outbreaks in the EU. In addition, the Commission is also providing technical and scientific assistance to Russia and other countries in the region to help them in controlling and eradicating the disease.
