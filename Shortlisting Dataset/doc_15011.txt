WRITTEN QUESTION E-3031/08 by Christofer Fjellner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (27 May 2008) Subject: GSP rules for Vietnam Since the Commission is currently reviewing its Generalised System of Preferences in order to adapt technical details in the GSP I provisions, I would grateful if the Commission could clarify the following with respect to Vietnam. On 21 December 2007, the EU Commission proposed that tariff preferences for shoes from Vietnam that come under Section XII of the Combined Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature (CN) be withdrawn from the EU's Generalised System of Preferences as of 1 January 2009. Under the current rules, the EU Commission can only withdraw tariff preferences for Section XII products if the imports in question account for less than 50 % of the value of all GSP imports into the EU from Vietnam. Can the Commission explain why Section XII imports of shoes from Vietnam have fallen? Can the Commission describe what effect the EU's antidumping tariffs on shoes have had on imports of shoes into the EU from Vietnam? Can the Commission also say what method has been used to calculate the value of Vietnamese shoes exported to the EU?
