Question for written answer E-011248/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Ulrike Rodust (S&D) (13 January 2011) Subject: Monitoring the impact of cormorants on inland fishing As the Commission is aware, cormorant management in the EU entails conflicts of interest between fisheries and bird conservation, a subject mentioned by Parliament in its resolution of 4 December 2008. According to my information, the economic effects of the growing cormorant population have not been determined all Member States and regions. Data on cormorant distribution and numbers and the related trends in the individual Member States should be gathered by a standard method in order to provide a meaningful basis for assessment of the damage caused by cormorants on account of their fish-eating. In addition, figures, broken down in detail, must be compiled on the state of commercial inland fishing with a view to establishing the connection existing at EU, national, and regional level with the cormorant population trend. Other adverse effects on inland fishing, that is to say, those which cannot be attributed to cormorants, should likewise be systematically gauged. 1. Does the Commission have Europe-wide data, broken down by region, for the years 2000 to 2010 on the cormorant population trend, including data on breeding pairs, breeding success, total numbers, food, and hunting and scaring tactics? 2. Does it have figures for the years 2000 to 2010 on inland fishing catches (including pond cultivation)? 3. Does it have data covering the above period on other factors, not attributable to cormorants, which have reduced inland fishing yields? 4. If the answer to the above questions is no, why is the Commission failing to gather these data? 5. In principle, does the Commission have any data on the damage to inland fishing caused by cormorants?
