provisions. The organiser shall, in any case, request that certification prior to submitting statements of support for verification in accordance with Article 9 . 2. Prior to initiating the collection of statements of support from signatories, the organisers shall ensure that the online collection system used for that purpose complies with the provisions of paragraph 4. The organisers may, at any time, ask the relevant competent authority of the Member State in which the data collected is or will be stored, to certify that the online collection system complies with those provisions. The organisers shall, in any case, request that certification prior to initiating the collection of statements of support. The organisers shall make a copy of the certificate issued in that regard publicly available on the website used for the online collection system. Within six months following the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall make available an open-source software incorporating some of the technical and security features necessary for compliance with the provisions of this Regulation regarding the online collection systems. The software shall be freely made available to organisers. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament of the state of progress in the creation of the open-source software by no later than three months after the entry into force of this Regulation. Justification In order for the open-source software to guarantee that the online collection of signatures is simple, unified in all the Member States and respects the data protection requirements, the Commission should inform the Parliament on the progress made. This should be done before the open-source software is definitely made available. This would enable to point out problems in order for the Commission to correct them. The online collection of signatures should be facilitated by the Commission by making available an open-source software. It is more appropriate to request the certificate for online collection systems prior, and not after, the collection of signatures. Moreover, this certificate should be made public on the website so that citizens know that they can trust the system.
