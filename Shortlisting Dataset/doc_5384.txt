WRITTEN QUESTION E-4695/08 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (8 September 2008) Subject: European consumers' health guarantees in respect of imported fishery products Various European associations of fishery producers are perplexed and extremely worried by the fact that third country fishery companies and products are banned from the US market by the FDA, while these selfsame companies and selfsame products nonetheless enjoy authorised access to the EU market. The lists in question can be checked and compared on the websites of the FDA and SANCO. Given the high technical and sanitary standards we believe the EU enjoys, and the demands made of our own producers, this disparity with regard to criteria is truly remarkable; it is a source of concern not only for health but also for commercial reasons, given the possibility of unfair competition. 1. Is the Commission aware of this disparity between EU and US criteria? What are the reasons for it? 2. What guarantees do European consumers enjoy with regard to products and companies banned in the USA but allowed in the EU? 3. Do the same technical and sanitary requirements and controls thereof apply to European products, and imported products? 4. What kind of controls, over and above the checks carried out by the Member States in themselves, does the Commission carry out to assess these imported products? 5. How many checks has the Commission made this year? Which fishery products were rejected, and where did these products originate? 6. To what extent does the Commission use the parameters laid down by the FDA in the USA as a point of reference?
