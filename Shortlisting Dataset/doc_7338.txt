Question for oral answer O-000086/2011 to the Commission Rule 115 Claude Moraes , Rosario Crocetta , Rita Borsellino , Sylvie Guillaume on behalf of the S&D Group Subject: Response to the migration flows in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean The wave of political revolution in North Africa has been accompanied by migration flows as people flee instability and violence, particularly in the case of Libya. So far these movements have been horizontal rather than vertical and mainly affect the region itself (Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria). However, some 7 000 Tunisians are also reported to have arrived on the shores of Lampedusa. Given that these movements put solidarity under pressure, both towards neighbouring countries and within the EU, we would like to ask the following questions: – What does the Commission plan to do in order to help the countries of the region to manage the situation and support those who are stuck in the region and who might require international protection? – Given the critical situation of migrants in Lampedusa and Evros, what does the Commission intend to do in order to make Italy and Greece enforce the 2001 Temporary Protection Directive and the 2003 Reception Directive? – Given the particularly vulnerable situation of unaccompanied minors reported to have arrived in Lampedusa, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure the adequate protection of this group? – What does the Commission intend to do regarding the relocation of refugees in the EU and between the Member States, particularly regarding applicants who require international protection? – What does the Commission intend to do to establish more systematic solidarity mechanisms among Member States in order to resettle migrants arriving in the Mediterranean region? – In the longer term, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure that the EU common asylum system becomes a reality by 2012?
