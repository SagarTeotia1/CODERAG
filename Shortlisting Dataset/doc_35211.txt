Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (22 September 2005) The remaining grounds of the infringement procedure referred to by the Honourable Member 1997/4703. concern, first of all, the conformity with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC Council Directive of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, OJ L 175, 5.7.1985. as amended by 97/11/EC Council Directive of 3 March 1997, OJ L 73, 14.3.1997. ) of Irish legislation dividing decision-making responsibilities between Irish planning authorities and Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency and, secondly, practice of Irish decision-making authorities of sometimes seeking important environmental data from developers through conditions in development consents rather than through the information-gathering stage of a prior environmental impact assessment (EIA) Case reference 1997/4703. . An application has not yet been lodged with the European Court of Justice.
