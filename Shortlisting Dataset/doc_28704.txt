Question for written answer E-003171/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (31 March 2011) Subject: Impact of the decline in predatory fish species Has the Commission commissioned any research, either internally or externally, on the wider impact of the decline in predatory fish species that is occurring across the world’s oceans, including the possibility that this decline may be responsible for an increase in algae deposits? It is believed that over sixty million sharks a year are now being killed. Does the Commission have comparable figures for the different species of tuna being killed, or the rapidity of the decline in the tuna stock worldwide? The Commission will be aware that it is increasingly common, at least in the Pacific, for shark fishermen to slice off the fins of the shark before allowing the shark to descend, helpless, to the ocean floor. Is the EU party to any international convention that outlaws such practices, and requires the shark to be killed before it is dismembered in this way? Is the recent declaration of the European Parliament likely to have any impact on this cruel and unnecessary practice?
