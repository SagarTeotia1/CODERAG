Question for written answer E-6094/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE) (27 July 2010) Subject: Information, deletion-request and complaints procedures (TFTP) On 1 August 2010 the EU-US Agreement on the Processing and Transfer of Financial Message Data from the EU to the US for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) comes into force. Do the rights to information and deletion set out in the agreement refer to all data transferred to the US or only to the data extracted in the US? How exactly can EU citizens determine what bank data concerning them have been saved in the US? How can EU citizens find out whether non-extracted data about them have been transferred to the US? Which authorities will handle information, deletion-request and complaints procedures in the US and the EU? Will special forms be required or an administration fee charged? What are the estimated costs of information, deletion-request and complaints procedures? Who will be required to bear these costs? What must EU citizens do if they wish to object to the fact that their data have been saved? To what extent do the rights to information apply to data transferred before 1 August 2010?
