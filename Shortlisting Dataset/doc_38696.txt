mid-2008 prices rose steeply, followed by a sharp increase in consumer prices; notes that this steep increase in basic commodity prices was followed swiftly by a sharp fall in commodity prices to unsustainable levels; remains concerned that food prices may surge again as the global economy recovers, as many of the structural problems, including lack of investment and high demand in certain regions, persist; 5. Notes with concern the escalating costs of farm inputs (increases in prices of fertilisers, seeds, etc.) which have translated into a rise in costs for which not all farmers (particularly in the livestock sector) have been equally compensated and which has significantly eroded any potential increase in farm incomes stemming from higher commodity and food prices, thus lessening the stimulus to increase sustainable agricultural production; is concerned that dramatic increases in input prices could result in less use of inputs and potentially reduced output, which would exacerbate the food crisis in Europe and the world; 6. Points out that the price volatility of recent years - both the highs and the lows - has made guaranteeing food security a particularly elusive goal; stresses that if farmers do not receive a fair price for their produce they will cease production; points out once again that EU farms produce between 17 % and 30 % of the world's wheat, milk and beef; stresses that maintaining viable farms in the EU will be of paramount importance for food supplies in the EU and throughout the world in the years to come; 7. Draws attention to the longer-term structural causes at play in the recent increase in prices of agricultural commodities, including steadily rising global demand and sustained reductions in investment in productive agriculture; notes that, among these factors, the increase in the price of energy, and in particular in the oil price, has had a major impact on global agricultural production (due to increasing production and food-distribution costs) and on the frequency of food crises in poor countries (owing to higher food transport costs within those countries); 8. Notes that to feed a world population expected to surpass 9 billion in 2050 agricultural output will have to increase by 70 % between now and then; points out that over 860 million people globally suffer from chronic hunger; notes that the World Bank predicts that the surge in food prices and the current fuel and food crisis will push an additional 130-155 million people into deeper poverty compared to 2008; 9. Believes that the CAP should remain the cornerstone of EU food-security policy and that it should be further adapted to meet food-security concerns in Europe and at world level; cautions against the dismantling of market-support measures and cuts in farm-support payments in the light of the extreme volatility of commodity prices and, hence, farm incomes; 10. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and solidarity and the need to refrain from taking unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations which endanger food security; calls for balanced trade agreements, as they are an essential
