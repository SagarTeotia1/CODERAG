Question for written answer E-000306/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Elżbieta Katarzyna Łukacijewska (PPE) (19 January 2012) Subject: Youth Opportunities Initiative Under the European Union’s multiannual financial framework for the period 2007-2013, the European Social Fund (ESF) was allocated EUR 76 billion, some two-thirds of which is earmarked for issues relating to education and employment. Towards the end of December last year the Commission published a communication on the Youth Opportunities Initiative which focused on the issue of unemployment among young people and ways of combating this problem. Given that EUR 30 billion of the funds available under the ESF is still unused, are there any priority measures under which it is possible to finance paid apprenticeships and traineeships for young people, as recommended for all the Member States, in order to improve their chances of subsequently finding employment? If this is not possible, is the Commission considering making it so under the new multiannual financial framework for the period 2014-2020?
