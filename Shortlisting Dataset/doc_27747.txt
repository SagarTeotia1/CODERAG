Answer given by Mrs de Palacio on behalf of the Commission (4 October 2004) The new Guidelines Decision No 884/2004/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, OJ L 167, 30.4.2004 . for the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), adopted by the co-legislators in April 2004, include 30 priority projects. The dates of completion indicated are based on national planning objectives, following the commitment expressed by Members States under the High Level Group on TEN-T and in the Council. According to the Guidelines, ‘European Coordinators’ may be designated to facilitate the implementation of cross-border project sections, integrated evaluation procedures are recommended allowing all border regions to be consulted, and appropriate measures may be taken if projects face significant delays. For parts of the three projects mentioned, the Member States concerned have submitted proposals for Community funding of European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS)-related projects, which are currently evaluated on the basis of the conditions and criteria of Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 of 18 September 1995 Amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 laying down general rules fort he granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks, OJ L 143, 30.4.2004 . . The financial structure of projects is the responsibility of the Member States concerned. In the case of upgradings of existing lines, the potential for PPP seems relatively low. All cross-border sections of priority projects are potentially eligible for EU co-financing up to 20 %, according to the amended Regulation (EC) No 2236/95. Regarding the cross-border sections of the connections between Luxembourg-Metz, and Metz–Saarbruecken, the need for increasing co-financing still has to be verified. The improvement of the Trans-European railway network plays a significant role in the European transport policy White Paper, "European transport policy 2010: time to decide" COM(2001) 370 final. . The extended impact assessment of the new Guidelines SEC (2003) 1060. Extended impact assessment of the proposal amending the amended proposal for a decision amending Decision No 1692/96/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the trans-European transport network. shows the importance of the development and interoperability of the TEN-T priority projects, contributing to modal rebalance. The expected date of completion for project 28, Eurocaprail, is based on the national objectives. Belgium is examining alternatives for the Brussels-Luxembourg section. Completion of the project will ensure better insertion of the areas concerned in the European railway network, contributing to connectivity and modal rebalance. In this context, and in the framework of the preparation of the new financial perspectives 2007-2013, the Commission proposed, on 14 July 2004, an increase of the maximum rate of funding from the TEN-T budget up to 50% for cross-border priority sections and projects linked to the deployment of interoperable systems, of safety and security, as an incentive in exceptional cases, together with an increase of the total TEN-T budget.
