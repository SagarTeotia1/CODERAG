ORAL QUESTION H-0661/06 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Danutė Budreikaitė to the Council Subject: EU gas market In its work programme on energy policy, the Finnish Presidency of the Council intends to concentrate mainly on relations with third countries and EU-Russia dialogue. This is understandable in view of the EU’s reliance on imported energy supplies. The programme provides for the implementation of an effective internal market for electricity and gas, which would help the EU to become more competitive and more secure. However, is Finland aware that, with a view to creating an internal market for energy, the advisory group of electricity and natural gas regulatory bodies, which advises the Commission, decided to create four Regional Energy Market projects (North-East, North, South and South-East)? Not one of these projects includes the four Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland itself. What steps does the Presidency intend to take in order to stimulate the genuine creation of a single, rather than a fragmented, energy market?
