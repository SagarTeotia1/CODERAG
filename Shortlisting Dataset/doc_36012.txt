ORAL QUESTION H-0544/08 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Marco Pannella to the Commission Subject: Human rights and Vietnam Over the last few years, Vietnam has experienced a significant economic boom which has been supported by (amongst other things) the EU's development-aid and financial-support policies. The growth in the country's GDP has been matched by an increase in human-rights abuse. In particular, over 250 Montagnard political prisoners who were arrested in 2001 and 2004 have yet to be released, whilst a growing number of Khmer Kampuchea Krom are seeking asylum in Cambodia on account of religious persecution. Given that the Commission is making efforts to ensure that its development policies are more consistent with human rights, can the Commission consider itself satisfied with the impact which its support has on the situation of ethnic and religious minorities, immigrant workers and democracy activists in Vietnam? Does the Commission not think that it should check that the Vietnamese Government complies with the legal obligations which it assumed when it signed the cooperation agreements and ratified the international conventions on civil, political, social and economic rights?
