Reply (17 February 2005) As regards the question presented by the Honourable Member, it is noted that the European Union does not conduct, and has not conducted, any crisis management operations in Kosovo. On 9 April 2001 the Council had an exchange of views on the issue of depleted uranium (DU) munitions in the light of scientific evidence compiled by various international organisations. At the end of this exchange of views the Presidency summarised the discussion as follows : ‘The Council noted the work by various international organisations (UNEP, WHO, NATO, Ad hoc Group of experts set up by the Commission) on the possible health and environmental impact of exposure to depleted uranium in ammunition used in the Balkans. In these detailed and objective examinations, there exists no scientific evidence to link the use of depleted uranium with various illnesses suffered in the population or among those who served in conflict areas. However, due to the apparent health and environment problems in the region, the Council should remain committed to following possible further investigations closely and re-examining the issue if appropriate at a future stage. The Commission is already addressing some of the environmental problems in the region through ongoing projects. The Council encourages the Commission to take into account findings from the reports on depleted uranium, as well as the overall situation concerning environment and health issues, as the Commission draws up new country strategy papers for all the countries in the Western Balkans.’ Since the deliberations of 9 April 2001, the Council has not addressed the issue of depleted uranium.
