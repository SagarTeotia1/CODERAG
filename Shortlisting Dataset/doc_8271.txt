Question for written answer E-003681/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Debora Serracchiani (S&D) (14 April 2011) Subject: Children banned from Ryanair flights Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, a low-cost airline, has just announced that he is considering introducing the first ‘child-free’ flights. The idea arises from a survey of 1 000 customers in Europe which found that passengers would prefer there to be no children on board and would even be prepared to pay extra for child-free flights. The ban on children flying contravenes Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for action to combat discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. Does the Commission consider that the ban referred to above contravenes Article 10 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, from which it is clear that the Union aims to combat any form of discrimination based on sex, race, ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation? Does the Commission intend to: 1. step in to prevent any such ban being imposed, and 2. make sure, in future, that any prohibitions imposed are consistent with the European Union’s fundamental rights and values?
