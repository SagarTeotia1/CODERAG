Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2010) As the Honourable Member knows, Catalunya Caixa is the result of the merger of three Catalan savings banks (Caixa Catalunya, Caixa Manresa and Caixa Tarragona), which benefited from a capital injection provided by the Fund for the Orderly Restructuring of Banks (‘FROB’) in March 2010. The fact that Catalunya Caixa benefited from the FROB entails a number of obligations and limitations in, inter alia , the ordinary running of its business, among which is the obligation to refrain from ‘aggressive commercial practices’. The Commission is aware of the situation described by the Honourable Member and has engaged in a dialogue with the Spanish authorities in order to understand all the elements surrounding the commercial offer described. The Commission will analyse the issue and will monitor the respect of all behavioural commitments (and in particular the engagement regarding the aggressive commercial and marketing strategies) as established in the Decision No 28/2010 ‘Recapitalisation measures in favour of the banking sector in Spain’ http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/register/ .
