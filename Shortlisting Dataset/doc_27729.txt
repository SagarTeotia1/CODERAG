Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (21 February 2012) Reduction of nutrient inputs to the sea is one of the priority areas under the environmental pillar of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region. The project ‘Cleaner Waste Water’ strengthens work under Helcom Helcom (Helsinki Commission) is the governing body of the ‘Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area’. related to waste water treatment plants around the Baltic Sea. However, it is the obligation of each Member State to ensure the infrastructure for waste water. For some Member States which discharge into the Baltic Sea the transition periods (2015) given by the Accession Treaty have not expired. The progress in the implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC can be taken from http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-urbanwaste/implementation/implementationreports_en.htm Macro-regional projects on sustainable agriculture were established on policy issues, on concerns about animal waste as a pollution source of the Sea, and for advice to farmers. It is on the basis of results of those projects that the Commission encourages the Member States concerned to streamline some measures or activities of the future rural development programmes of the macro-region. The Commission is confident that the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region helps speed up cross-border actions and projects to improve waste water treatment and agricultural practices thereby promoting a transnational approach to eutrophication.
