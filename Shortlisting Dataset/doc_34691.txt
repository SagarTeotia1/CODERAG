2004/C 782 E/188 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3329/03 by Antonio Tajani (PPE-DE) to the Commission (12 November 2003) Subject: Eurobarometer poll according to which Israel is the greatest threat to world peace According to the Eurobarometer poll commissioned by the Commission, EU citizens consider Israel to be the country that presents the greatest threat to world peace. Does the Commission know what the criteria were for the wording of the questions? Is the Commission aware of the fact that in the answers offered to those questioned two democratic countries, the United States and Israel, were put on the same level as dictatorships and theocratic regimes that deny freedom? What steps will the Commission and its President Romano Prodi take to prevent the European institutions from legitimising thoughtless initiatives which may aggravate tension in Europe and the Middle East? What steps will the Commission take to prevent leaks of information on such sensitive subjects, as in the case of the findings of the Eurobarometer poll published in EL País ? Does the Commission not consider that Europe, mindful of the tragedy of the Holocaust, should take on greater responsibility for the quest for peace in the Middle East?
