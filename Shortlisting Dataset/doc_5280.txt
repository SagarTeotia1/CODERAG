Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (16 April 2007) The Commission sees the fight against climate change as one of its core policy priorities. The European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) is the Commission's main instrument for the EU's domestic coordinated climate policy. The ECCP includes in particular the emissions trading, measures covering energy supply and demand, energy efficiency in end-use equipment and industrial processes, transport, agriculture, forestry and research. Information providing an overview of the main policies and measures currently under implementation is published online (see web links below http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/pdf/eu_climate_change_progr.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/pdf/reducing_emissions_energy_transport.pdf ). The Kyoto Protocol with its commitments until 2012 is an important step to tackle the problem of climate change, though it is not sufficient. As outlined in its communication ‘Limiting global climate change to 2° Celsius: The way ahead for 2020 and beyond’ COM(2007)2 final. the Commission, and subsequently endorsed by the Environment Ministers of all Member States, believes that an international agreement should lead to a 30 % cut in collective greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries by 2020. To underline its commitment EU Environment Ministers decided that the European Union should commit to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 independent of an international agreement. In 2005, the second phase of the ECCP was launched addressing issues such as energy efficiency, energy supply, aviation, agriculture and forestry, non CO2 gases, carbon capture and storage, CO2 and cars, and the role of the EU in reducing vulnerability and promoting adaptation. Furthermore, the Commission's communication ‘An energy policy for Europe’ COM(2007)1 final proposes a number of specific targets and a concrete, wide ranging action plan for implementation which has been broadly endorsed by the EU Energy Ministers. The Commission is proposing measures to further reduce its emissions by saving 20 % of energy consumption by 2020, to increase the share of renewable energy to 20 % by 2020, to increase the share of biofuels by 10 % and to put in place a system of incentives for sustainable production of biofuels, to develop and deploy zero emission fossil fuel fired power plants, to improve the functioning of energy markets and increase competition, to improve the security of supply and to improve cross-border interconnectivity of electricity and gas networks.
