Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (28 April 2010) The feasibility of setting up a Caspian Development Corporation is currently being studied and this phase is expected to be finished in the middle of 2010. The concept must then be discussed at a political level with foreign partners and then a decision taken on whether to go ahead or not. When that decision is taken, the Commission will take into account the facts on the ground, the evolution of the markets and the current outlook for gas demand within the European Union. The CDC is a joint project that has been undertaken with the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is also involved, as are commercial interests and civil society. The CDC study is financed through a multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank, with the participation of the European Investment Bank (EIB), the World Bank and the Commission. The total contribution of the Commission to the trust fund is EUR 5 million which, besides the study on the CDC, will mainly be used to finance technical studies necessary for related gas infrastructure. The Commission's contribution to the CDC study represents only a small amount, below EUR 400 000 .
