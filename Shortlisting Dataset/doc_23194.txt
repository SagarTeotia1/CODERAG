Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2012) High Representative/Vice-President (HR/VP) Ashton is fully aware of the foiled assassination plot to kill the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the United States, as publicly announced by the United States authorities on 11 October 2011. HR/VP issued a public statement on 12 October 2011 in which she expressed very grave concern at the alleged participation of the two Iranian nationals and expressing her disquiet at the fact that formal charges have been brought against an alleged member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. Should the allegations brought against this person be proven true, then his actions would constitute a major breach of international law. The Council decided, on 21 October 2011, to subject five persons to restrictive measures aimed at combating terrorism. As a result, any financial assets of these individuals held in the EU are frozen, and no funds may be made available to them. The Council has not decided to impose restrictive measures on the Iranian commercial airline, Mahan Air. As mentioned above, restrictive measures have already been imposed by the EU on some members of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Quds Force have both been designated by the EU.
