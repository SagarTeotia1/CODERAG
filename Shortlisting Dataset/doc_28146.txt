Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) The Commission is finalising a proposal on this issue. This proposal will be submitted for opinion to the Management Committee for the common organisation of the agricultural markets. The date of implementation of the proposal will take account of the international obligations of the Community and the proposal will foresee that operators have a transition period to adapt to the new rules.
