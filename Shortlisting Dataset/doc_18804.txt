2004/C 84 E/164 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3987/03 by Gerhard Schmid (PSE) to the Commission (7 January 2004) Subject: Galileo There have been reports in the German media (e.g. the ARD news bulletin of 29 November 2003) that the satellite-supported navigation system Galileo will work on a frequency which can easily be interfered with by the American military at any time. Without consulting Europe, American forces could switch off Europe's Galileo satellite navigation system in the event of crisis or conflict. In addition — according to the reports — the Americans will require the open Galileo signal to be weakened and made qualitatively inferior. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Is this information correct? 2. If so, what is the Commission's attitude to it, and what measures does it envisage taking?
