Answer given by Mr Bolkestein on behalf of the Commission (16 November 2004) The traveller’s cheque is a paper payment instrument which has a complicated handling process. This is the reason why fewer and fewer banks and post offices offer this service. They consider automatic cash dispensers to be a much simpler alternative. It is a commercial choice made by each bank as to whether or not they supply this service. There is, furthermore, no Community legislation in this area. This refusal to accept traveller’s cheques in the single market is not therefore a legal infringement of the internal market rules.
