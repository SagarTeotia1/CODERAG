the use of personal laptops is sometimes limited or forbidden. 4. The evaluation criteria are set out in the Rules for Participation http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/find-doc_en.html , and elaborated further in the work programmes. The criteria used by experts are related to: scientific and/or technological excellence (to the extent that the proposed work is relevant to the call); potential impact and implementation. There is no criterion for ‘innovation potential in individual Member States’. Indeed, research proposals must in most cases be presented by consortia from at least three Member States or countries associated to the framework Programme. 5. The Commission believes that in general a diverse panel of experts leads to higher quality evaluations. Nevertheless, the FP7 rules for submission and evaluation http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/find-doc_en.html state that the paramount criteria for selecting experts are firstly, a high level of expertise, and secondly, an appropriate range of competences. Only if these conditions can be satisfied will the selection also take account of national balance, gender etc. 6. On 8th October 2008, at the invitation of the Member of the Commission responsible for Science and Research, members of the Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee were invited to the evaluation facility (‘Covent Garden’) in Brussels to witness the process for themselves and speak to evaluators and officials. This was considered very informative and useful by the visitors, and subsequently contacts have been made with the Secretariat of the Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) Committee with a view to extending a similar invitation to ITRE members. The Honourable Members would therefore be more than welcome to see at first hand the high degree of professionalism, efficiency and dedication shown by the staff and evaluators.
