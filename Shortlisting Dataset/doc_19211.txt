Joint answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-010525/10 , E-010980/10 , P-010779/10 , E-010696/10 , E-010590/10 , P-010861/10 , E-010982/10 , E-011110/10 , E-010529/10 (31 January 2011) The Commission welcomes the Financial Times ' scrutiny as part of a public debate about the efficiency and effectiveness of cohesion policy. The Commission is aware of the habitual slower take-up at the beginning of a programming period. The most recent data shows, however, that the Commission made more cohesion policy payments in the 4th quarter of 2010 than ever before. The vast majority of the payments made were interim payments, meaning that they are reimbursements of expenditure already made and certified in the Member States. This indicates that, as has been seen in previous programming periods, cohesion policy spending ‘on the ground’ is increasing as the programming period progresses. The absorption (in terms of EU payments to Member States) is now at 21 % for the Cohesion Fund, 22 % for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and 23 % for the European Social Fund (ESF). The most important reasons for slow absorption so far can be summarised: — an option to extend the closure of 2000‑06 programming period was provided to the Member States (in order to combat the financial and economic crisis); therefore, Member States concentrated efforts on closure and absorption of the 2000‑06 allocation — in some cases, a late adoption of the programming documents for 2007‑13 period — the financial crisis and the lack of adequate co-financing (some Member States are cutting public budgets and focusing resources on the most essential public services) — a lack of simplicity with the regulations and implementation rules. To deal with this situation, the Commission has adopted a number of initiatives aimed at simplifying rules which should help to facilitate access to the funds and accelerate investment flows. For example, the Commission implemented measures that made it possible to bring forward to 2009 EUR 6.3 billion of payments, in the form of additional advances, to add to the EUR 23 billion in advances already paid out (in the years 2007 to 2009). This front-loading of resources has helped to tackle immediate cash flow problems at a time when public budgets are under pressure. The Commission is also making significant efforts to try to accelerate implementation, by investing in training and capacity building of national, regional and local officials, and further simplifying procedures. The Commission keeps close bilateral contacts with the managing authorities and encourages them to improve implementation, especially with regards to automatic decommitment targets or the preparation of strategic investment projects. The Member States themselves carried out a number of actions to improve the implementation of cohesion policy programmes. The Commission elaborated a detailed summary of the measures SEC(2010)1291 final of 25.10.2010 — ‘Cohesion policy: Responding to the economic crisis’: A review of the implementation of cohesion policy measures adopted in support of the European Economic Recovery Plan. which is based on the documents provided by the Member States in their 2009 national strategic reports.
