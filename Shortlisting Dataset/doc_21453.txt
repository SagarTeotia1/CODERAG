Question for written answer E-000777/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Dan Jørgensen (S&D) (31 January 2012) Subject: Welfare of pigs It appears from reports by the Food and Veterinary Office that in certain Member States some veterinarians may be inadvertently giving incorrect advice to their pig farmer clients as to the steps they need to take in order to meet the requirements of Council Directive 2008/120/EC. It seems that some veterinarians may be advising clients that the provision of metal chains or plastic chew-toys is sufficient to meet the requirements of paragraph 4 of Chapter I of Annex I to the directive, which provides that pigs ‘must have permanent access to a sufficient quantity of material to enable proper investigation and manipulation activities’. It also appears that some veterinarians may be advising clients that it is permissible to tail-dock even where they have not changed ‘inadequate environmental conditions or management systems’ before docking as required by paragraph 8 of Chapter I. Does the Commission plan to discuss with veterinary bodies the advisability of guidance being provided for veterinarians regarding the steps their clients need to take to comply with the above provisions?
