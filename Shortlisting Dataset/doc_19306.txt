Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (24 May 2007) The Commission is aware about the ‘State of the World's Minorities 2007’ report which shows that the country which made the biggest jump of all is Sri Lanka, which saw a return to conflict last year and which moved 47 places since 2006 to be ranked 14th in 2007. Minority Tamils and Muslims are caught up in fighting between government and rebel forces and also suffer human rights abuses including killings, abductions and disappearances. The Commission is not surprised by the findings of Minority Rights Group International given the appalling consequences which the long-standing conflict has caused to the Tamil and Muslim minorities. In relation to the general human rights situation, the Commission welcomes the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry (CoI) and the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP). However, the Commission shares the analysis of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, on the fact that the CoI and IIGEP have an important role to play but their limitation being that they are set to deal with past abuses; in the dramatic context of Sri Lanka there is clearly also the need to have a forward-looking human rights monitoring capacity [such as a fully fledged United Nations Office of the High Commissioneer for Human Rights (UNOHCHR)] which can deter further violations. For this to be created, the support of the majority of members in the UN Human Rights Council and the agreement of the Sri Lankan authorities would be needed. The Commmission has been, and still is, very committed to promoting good governance and respect for Human Rights in Sri Lanka. The EU has already tabled a resolution on Sri Lanka in the UN Human Rights Council, with mixed results so far. The case of Sri Lanka is expected to come back on the table in the forthcoming June 2007 session, and in that perspective the Commission will strive to develop a consensus for a mechanism to be put in place to ensure human rights monitoring.
