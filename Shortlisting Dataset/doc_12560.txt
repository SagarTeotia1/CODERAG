Question for written answer E-9425/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (11 November 2010) Subject: HST — Galician objections to diversion of funds According to reports in the Portuguese media, the President of the Galician Autonomous Government has written to the Commission President to ask him to reject the request to switch the Community funding intended for the Porto to Vigo high-speed train line to the Lisbon to Madrid line section. Alberto Núñez Feijóo is totally opposed to the Portuguese Government’s request, as he believes that the measure in question would seriously undermine the cohesion and territorial balance of the Iberian peninsula, a goal which the Commission treats as a priority. He considers that the adverse impact would be worsened by the fact that Galicia and North Portugal, which between them have nearly seven million inhabitants, is the only Euroregion without a proper cross-border public transport system. In his letter he maintains that if the Commission were to allow the support to be reprogrammed and the funds transferred to the Lisbon to Madrid high-speed train line, the Galicia-North Portugal Euroregion would be disadvantaged in terms of cohesion and competitiveness compared with other parts of the EU. In the light of the foregoing, what does the Commission think about the complaint from the President of the Galician Autonomous Government?
