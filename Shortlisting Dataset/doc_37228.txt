Joint answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-002302/11 , E-002368/11 (10 May 2011) Marine litter is one of the emerging topics of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive Directive 2008/56/EC, OJ L 164, 25.6.2008. (MSFD) which aims at achieving Good Environmental Status (GES) in European marine waters by 2020. The Commission has established a technical group on marine litter to support Member States in their obligations under the MSFD. Its tasks are dedicated to giving guidance to Member States on the four indicators on marine litter which were in the COM decision on criteria and methodological standards on Good Environmental Status Commission Decision 2010/477/EU, OJ L 232, 2.9.2010. . Those indicators refer to the trends in the amount of litter on the shoreline, in the water column, including micro-plastics and ingested by sea animals. In July 2012 the Member States have to report on the initial assessment of the marine environment, including a determination of Good Environmental Status and establish targets. Ship-generated wastes including oil residues, noxious substances residues, sewage and garbage are regulated by the Marpol Convention and its annexes, most of which have been ratified by the Member States. Furthermore, requirements for port reception facilities have been incorporated in the European legislation by Directive 2000/59/EC Directive 2000/59/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2000 on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues, OJ L 332, 28.12.2000. which entered into force in 2002. The purpose of this directive is to reduce the discharges of the ship-generated waste and cargo residues into the sea from ships using ports in the Union, by improving the availability and use of port reception facilities, thereby enhancing the protection of the marine environment. It applies to all ships, including fishing vessels and recreational craft, irrespective of their flag. The implementation of this directive made a significant contribution to curbing the discharge of ship-generated wastes into the marine environment of the EU. The Commission is currently reviewing the abovementioned Port Reception Facilities Directive in order to address the implementation problems shown by practical experience, assess possible areas for improvement, and with a view to achieving the objective of ‘zero discharges at sea’ from ships calling at EU ports. A new legislative proposal is foreseen and should be adopted by the Commission in the course of 2012. A public consultation will be launched in the months to come. As indicated in the responses to Question E‑000718/2011 by Mr Mölzer, E‑002413/2010 by Mrs Angelilli and E‑000095/2011 by Mr Arsenis http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/ , it will be necessary to focus on all aspects of the waste cycle of plastics and other material in a comprehensive manner in order to be effective. Such an approach should involve all major stakeholders (industry, science, NGOs, institutes, Member States and third countries at EU, regional, national and local level) and consider actions with regard to change in design and production, increased prevention and reduced use, education and awareness raising, research and monitoring, strengthening existing policies and stimulate remediation activities. The Commission is now assessing
