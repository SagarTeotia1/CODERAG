2004/C 70 E/024 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3759/02 by Jan Mulder (ELDR) to the Commission (23 December 2002) Subject: Verification of the origin of ACP sugar In its answer to my Written Question E-2533/02 OJ C 110 E, 8.5.2003, p. 66 . , the Commission states that, while it is perfectly possible to carry out verifications of the origin of ACP sugar, such verifications have never been carried out. The Commission admits that it has no reason to believe that the sugar imported under the Sugar Protocol does not originate solely in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries concerned . The vast difference between the price of sugar on the world market and the price in the European Union certainly constitutes a good reason for the carrying out of such verifications. 1. Why has the Commission never taken the opportunity of carrying out verifications? 2. When does the Commission intend to carry out such verifications? 3. In what way and how often does the Commission intend in the future to verify the origin of imported sugar from the 48 poorest countries (under the Anything-But-Arms proposal and the ACP Sugar Protocol)?
