Question for written answer E-000640/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Fiorello Provera (EFD) (27 January 2012) Subject: Radioactive material stolen from Egyptian nuclear power station On 19 January, the UK’s Daily Telegraph reported that a safe containing radioactive material at the Dabaa nuclear power plant had been seized, while another safe containing radioactive material had been broken open and part of its contents taken. The plant, which is currently under construction, is located on Egypt’s North-West coast. Egypt’s al-Ahram newspaper reported that the government has alerted the security authorities and asked for specialised teams to help search for the stolen material. At least a dozen people were wounded last week when military police tried to disperse residents and protestors who are mainly Bedouin and claim that their land has been confiscated in order to build the nuclear plant. One security force official reported that soldiers and demonstrators hurled stones at each other, and gunfire was exchanged after protestors demolished a wall surrounding the site . Al-Ahram reported that staff at the plant have refused to go to the site because of the worsening security situation. 1. Is the Commission aware of the abovementioned report? 2. Is the Commission prepared to offer logistical support to help the Egyptian authorities locate the stolen radioactive contents? 3. Is the Commission prepared to consult with EU officials in Egypt in order to assess the potential security hazards posed by this incident?
