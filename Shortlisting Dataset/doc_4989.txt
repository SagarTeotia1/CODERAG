Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (17 July 2007) The ‘European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System’ (EARSS), funded (2003-2006) by the EU Public Health Programme, gives an account of antimicrobial resistance in the EU of bacteria responsible for respiratory infections in their 2005 annual report (http://www.rivm.nl/earss). For example for Streptococcus pneumoniae, large differences in the proportion non-susceptible to penicillin (PNSP) were reported in the Member States, ranging from 1 % in the Netherlands (n=802) to 39 % in Romania (n=18), with an average of 10 % (n= 10 741). No consistent trends were observed over time. With regard to resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae against erythromycin, most of the Member States reported between 10 % and 25 % resistance. Dual resistance to penicillin and erythromycin remained below 5 % for most countries, but has reached high levels in France (32 %, n=632) and Romania (31 %, n=13). For most of the countries, no significant changes in dual resistance were observed. The level of use of antibiotics in the EU is monitored by ‘European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption’ (ESAC; http://www.esac.ua.ac.be), funded (2004-2007) by the EU Public Health Programme. Data on consumption in 2003 for 20 Member States show an average consumption of about 20 Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per 1 000 inhabitants per day, ranging from 9.78 (The Netherlands) to 31.4 (Greece) DDD/1 000 inhabitants/day. The DDD is a standardised indicator developed by the World Health Organisation and reflects the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults.
