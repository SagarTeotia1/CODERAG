Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (2 February 2011) The ageing of Europe's population, which the scale of immigration is insufficient to offset, is the inevitable result of rising life expectancy and falling birth rates. The percentage of older people is therefore increasing while the total population remains roughly constant. One emerging challenge is the retirement of the large cohorts born during the baby boom. The 2008 Demography Report ‘Meeting Social Needs in an Ageing Society’ http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=89&newsId=419&furtherNews=yes. presents these developments and discusses them in greater detail. In March 2011 the Commission plans to publish its third 2010 European Demography report which among other things will contain an update of the latest demographic trends and how the crisis has affected families. 1. The Commission October 2006 communication on Europe's demographic future ‘The demographic future of Europe: From challenge to opportunity’ (COM(2006)571) at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52006DC0571:EN:NOT outlines a comprehensive strategy for tackling population change. The Commission believes that, despite the current crisis, the approach advocated is still valid, as the 2009 Ageing Report ‘Dealing with the impact of an ageing population in the EU’ (COM(2009)180) at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52009DC0180:EN:NOT stresses. It also considers that promoting the concept of ‘active ageing’, which allows older people to realise their full potential and remain active members of society, is crucial to dealing with the consequences of a rapidly changing population-age structure. It has proposed that 2012 be designated European Year of Active Ageing Commission proposal (COM(2010)462) at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010PC0462:EN:NOT with the aim of encouraging policy-makers and stakeholders at all levels to take action to foster active ageing. 2. The 2009 Ageing Report (Economic and budgetary projections for the EU‑27 Member States (2008‑60)) http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication_summary14911_en.htm discusses the specific challenges that ageing poses for the welfare State. In addition, under the Open Method of Coordination in the social protection and social inclusion fields, the EU supports, monitors and assesses the impact and implementation of national reforms to develop adequate retirement pensions and accessible healthcare services and ensure their long-term sustainability http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=750&langId=en . The Commission has also published a Green Paper on Pensions http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=89&newsId=839&furtherNews=yes to launch an open debate on whether and how the EU level pensions framework should be developed to best support Member States in their task of ensuring they provide their citizens with adequate, sustainable and safe pensions — both now and in the future. On the basis of the replies received, the Commission will present a follow-up White Paper in the course of 2011. The new Commission EU 2020 strategy adopted in 2010 by the Member States to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/priorities/inclusive-growth/index_en.htm contains three flagship initiatives that are particularly relevant in order to prepare for demographic change. These three initiatives aim (1) at unleashing the potential of young people (Youth on the Move), (2) at developing individual skills and modernising labour markets (Agenda for new Skills and Jobs) and (3) at ensuring economic, social and territorial cohesion (European Platform against Poverty). 3. Birth rates may be boosted through the removal of obstacles that prevent people from having the number of children they desire. Survey evidence
