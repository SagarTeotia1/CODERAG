Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (31 May 2011) Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for free movement of workers. However, the transitional arrangements in the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania allow the Member States to derogate from that fundamental freedom and restrict access to their labour markets for a maximum of seven years after those two countries joined the EU. Decisions to maintain, or to lift, restrictions on labour market access by Bulgarian and Romanian workers are for the individual Member State, in accordance with the detailed provisions on transitional arrangements in the Act of Accession. A Member State must lift these restrictions by 31 December 2011 unless it informs the Commission by that date that it will continue to apply them because of serious disturbances in its labour market, or threat thereof. In this case, restrictions can apply until 31 December 2013 at the latest. As the transitional arrangements derogate from a fundamental freedom of the EU, and as the conditions for derogations from fundamental freedoms must be interpreted strictly, the Commission expects the Member States to provide a full justification with data and convincing arguments for the existence of any such serious disturbance of the labour market, or threat thereof. This notification does not require the Commission's assent so restrictions will continue to apply simply upon timely notification. The Commission will ask for further clarifications if it considers the justifications provided with the notification are not sufficient and will then assess the concrete analysis and arguments brought forward.
