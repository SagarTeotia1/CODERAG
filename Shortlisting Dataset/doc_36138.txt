Question for written answer E-011977/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Paweł Zalewski (PPE) (16 December 2011) Subject: Human rights violations in Azerbaijan According to an Amnesty International report published on 16 November 2011, human rights violations in Azerbaijan have been on the increase ever since demonstrations began in March and April 2011, with Azerbaijani citizens calling for democratic reforms and for human rights to be upheld. A report entitled ‘The spring that never blossomed: Freedoms suppressed in Azerbaijan’ details the wave of intimidations and arrests that followed the protests condemning corruption and the increasing repression of the independent media, NGOs and opposition parties. The EU ought to step up its support for democratic change in Azerbaijan, and dialogue on human rights ought to be intensified within the Eastern Partnership. In the light of the above: — What steps has the Commission taken in response to the recent events in Azerbaijan? — What is the Commission intending to do to combat human rights violations in Azerbaijan?
