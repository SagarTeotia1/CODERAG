Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (28 September 2007) All waste management facilities must conform to Article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive Directive 2006/12/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste, OJ L 114, 27.4.2000. which prohibits environmental damage from such facilities. In addition, incinerators are covered by the directive on the incineration of waste Directive 2000/76/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste, OJ L 332, 28.12.2000. , and other industrial installations, depending on the nature and capacity of the activity, can be covered by the directive concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, OJ L 257, 10.10.1996. . According to this latter Directive, all new installations (i.e. those put into operation after 30 October 1999) must comply with its provisions from the first day of operation. Therefore, installations must have a permit issued in accordance with the procedure laid down in the directive. The permit must contain in particular emission limit values and equivalent parameters and technical measures based on the best available techniques, and suitable release monitoring requirements. Existing installations (those put into operation before the abovementioned date) have to comply with the provisions from 30 October 2007. There is no Community environmental legislation that sets a maximum number of waste treatment units for a given geographical area. Planning decisions of this kind are a matter for the individual Member State concerned. On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, the Commission can not conclude that there is a breach of community legislation.
