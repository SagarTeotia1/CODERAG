the IASCF, and calls, in future for the chairpersons of the IASCF and the IASB to report to the Parliament at least once a year on all matters relevant to Parliament (including work programme, staff decisions, funding and controversial standards); 34. Expresses concern, while supporting the IASB's intention to improve existing standards, that making continual adjustments, and even small changes, can be costly and result in expensive changes for large companies; believes that any changes should only happen when deemed necessary following a cost-benefit analysis; 35. Notes that the IASB is carrying out broad-based consultation and field tests on its exposure draft on a standard for SMEs; requests that more serious attention be paid to the results obtained from such consultations and field testing than has been the case with this exposure draft; underlines that this is necessary if the EU ever should begin considering taking account of the IFRS for SMEs or adopting EU standards for SMEs with the aim of converging with IFRS for SMEs; IFRS for SMEs 36. Considers that there is a widely shared view among SMEs that the standard IFRS proposed by the IASB is far too complicated for SMEs and, in addition, refers in many places to the full IFRS; takes the view that the obligations regarding appendices are too comprehensive and that the effort required is disproportionate in relation to the requirement to provide information; is concerned that the draft was designed with relatively large SMEs in mind (over fifty employees) and asserts that most SMEs are smaller in size; notes that SMEs are also concerned that the IASB intends to change the standard every two years; nevertheless, notes it could be a useful optional transition for larger, expanding SMEs, but underlines that this shall not be a waystation for enforced harmonisation; 37. Underlines that no political mandate has been conferred on the IASB to develop IFRS for SMEs; points out that the Community endorsement procedure applies only to international accounting standards for publicly traded companies and is not envisaged with regard to the IFRS for SMEs; 38. Notes that the endorsement procedure applies only to international accounting standards and interpretations for publicly traded companies; notes further that the endorsement procedure may not be used for the recognition of IFRS for SMEs; 39. Would propose to assess first whether EU SMEs will derive any benefits from a standard developed by the IASB; notes that generally the IASB considers itself as a standard setter in the interest of capital market investors; acknowledges that the IASB confirms in its 'basis for conclusions' that SMEs face different requirements to those for capital market investors; questions whether the balance relating to SMEs is currently sufficient in the IASB; acknowledges though that from other parts of the world there may be a request to develop a standard for SMEs and proposes that a more precise assessment of this demand be undertaken; underlines that this is without prejudice to the EU acceptance of a subsequent standard; 40. Takes the view that promoting (or encouraging) the voluntary use of IFRS is not
