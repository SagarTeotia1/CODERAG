Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (20 July 2010) Directive 2004/18/EC OJ L 134, 30.4.2004. on public contracts allows the contracting authorities to decide on the size of their public contracts, i.e. they can divide the contracts into separate, smaller lots or they can award the entire contract in the form of one main contract only. In any case the decision on whether to divide the contract into lots or to award it as one major contract only, shall not be taken with a view to avoiding application of the directive but shall be based on objective reasons. When it comes to the assessment of the actual tenders, the contracting authority is bound to the requirements established in the tender documents. Only those tenders that fulfil the requirements can be accepted. It may therefore well turn out in a tendering procedure that only one of the tenders indeed fulfils all of the different technical and economic requirements established by the contracting authority. It is not possible to contest, on this basis, the award of the contract to the company which presented this tender. In the absence of any further information, there is, at this stage, no reason for the Commission to take any action to investigate the case.
