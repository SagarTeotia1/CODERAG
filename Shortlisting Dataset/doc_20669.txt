Question for written answer E-010749/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mary Honeyball (S&D) (21 November 2011) Subject: The situation of foreign-language lecturers in Italy The Gelmini reforms have re-interpreted European Court of Justice judgment C-119/04 to the detriment of a number of foreign-language lecturers currently working in Italy. This reform has meant that foreign-language lecturers have lost up to 60 % of their expected salary and face large legal fees to bring their case before the courts. This is all because they are not from Italy. Not only does this contravene some of the most basic elements of labour laws within the European Union, namely, the free movement of labour, but it also contravenes the guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of nationality outlined in the Lisbon Treaty. Can the Commission do something to ensure that the laws of the European Union are enforced and respected in order that EU citizens working in any Member State receive their proper wage and are not discriminated against?
