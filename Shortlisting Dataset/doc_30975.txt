WRITTEN QUESTION E-1727/09 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (17 March 2009) Subject: Adults with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) or attention deficit disorder (ADD) Further to its answer of 20 May 2008 to my Question E‑1192/08 on ADHD or ADD, could the Commission indicate whether the calls for proposals under the Second Programme of Community Action in the Field of Health (2008‑13) and the work programme for 2009 due to be published in early 2009 envisage the possibility of EU support for adults with ADHD or ADD? In Ireland, for example, the services for children with ADHD or ADD finish at age 16 leaving, many with high levels of stress throughout their lives, and there are no medical professionals working in the area of ADHD or ADD and little or no interest shown in this condition. Has the Commission looked at the possibility of EU initiatives aimed at improving services for adults with ADHD or ADD?
