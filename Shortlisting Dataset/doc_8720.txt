MRC under the DCI Regulation Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation, OJ L 378, 27.12.2006. . As regards possible future DCI funding to MRC, the EC would like to see progress made in terms of organisational reforms including monitoring of programme implementation as well as progress made in addressing the needs to develop the river basin in a sustainable manner including proper consultation processes and comprehensive impact assessments. As far as financing under DIPECHO is concerned, the Commission will assess any proposal submitted by MRC in the context of the new DIPECHO Action Plan for 2008‑10 on the basis of past and current performance. All previous MRC interventions supported in this context have been closely monitored, as is the case for all projects funded under this budget line. The Commission will of course continue a close monitoring of the EC‑funded components, should any further support be granted to an MRC programme.
