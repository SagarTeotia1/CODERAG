Question for written answer E-000415/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Filip Kaczmarek (PPE) (27 January 2011) Subject: Smuggling of garlic from China to the EU Since 2009 the EU’s Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has uncovered several dozen cases of garlic being smuggled from China to the EU. The garlic involved has not undergone inspection by the plant health services. Sometimes it contains harmful pesticides, heavy metals and dioxins. Its consumption can cause poisoning, internal organ damage and cancer. The garlic reaches the EU by three routes: via Norway into Sweden, through Egypt, Turkey or Tunisia, and through the EU ports of Hamburg and Gdynia. At the border the garlic is declared as onion, which does not attract an import duty per tonne. In 2009 alone the smugglers earned EUR 15 million from the transport of garlic. Last year the resulting loss to the EU budget was over EUR 20 million. In connection with this, could the Commission answer the following questions: What is the Commission doing to tackle the smuggling of Chinese garlic? How does the Commission monitor whether garlic sold in the EU has the necessary plant health certificates?
