Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2011) The Commission approved the co‑financing of the works for the major project ‘Study, construction and commissioning of the Metro of Thessaloniki’. The funding came from the operational programme ‘Road axis, Ports, urban development’ under the third Community Strategic Framework from 2000‑06. The eligible expenditure for co-financing for the period 2000‑06 amounts to EUR 199 934 184 and the EU assistance set to 50 % of the eligible expenditure which amounts to EUR 99 967 092. The application for co-financing foresaw that this major project would also receive co-financing, after review and possible approval of the corresponding application for co-financing, from the Greek National Strategic Reference Framework programme ‘Macedonia-Thrace 2007‑13’. The envisaged eligible expenditure for the period 2007‑13 amounts to EUR 323 000 000, with the corresponding EU assistance to be set by the corresponding future approval decision. The total cost of this major project was budgeted at EUR 1 184 000 000. The difference between EU assistance and total cost is to be covered by national sources (of which part could be covered by EIB loans). For the period 2000‑06, there is a reference to an approved loan of EUR 650 million, of which 400 million have been disbursed (EUR 100 million in 2008, EUR 100 million in 2009 and EUR 200 million in 2010). The Commission can report the payments against the certified expenditure of undertaken works. With the last expenditure declaration received on June 2010, EUR 202.39 million has been declared as eligible expenditure for the period 2000‑06 for this project and the Commission has therefore reimbursed a total of EUR 99.97 million. Additionally, EUR 62 665 642.43 have been declared as eligible expenditure under the 2007‑13 period and EU assistance at the rate of 82.95 %, as foreseen in the priority ‘Sustainable development and quality of life’ for the region of Central Macedonia has been paid. This is despite the fact that the Greek authorities have still not submitted an official application for the part to be co-financed in the 2007‑13 period As provided by the Council Regulation 284/2009 of April 7, 2009, which amended Council Regulation 1083/2006. In its Recital 8 provides: ‘In order to accelerate the implementation of major projects, it is necessary to allow expenditures relating to major projects which have not yet been adopted by the Commission to be included in expenditure declarations.’ Article 1.4.( c ) of the same Regulation provides on how to treat this expenditure in case that the Commission might not approve the EU's contribution to these Major Projects. . The Commission has not received any official information about any change in the implementation timetable of the project, as no official application for the part to be co-financed in the 2007‑13 period has been received. The Commission will enter into negotiations with the relevant Greek authorities about possible changes of the physical content and the methodology of this project once an official application for the part to be co-financed in the 2007‑13 period has been received. Only then,
