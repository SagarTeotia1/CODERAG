additional measures to support the Member States in the fields of prevention, reforestation, research and civil protection coordination, with a view to strengthening indispensable national and local firefighting resources, developing synergies between existing rural development and structural funds programmes and the Framework Programme on Research; 8. Calls on the Commission to provide specific aid for the farmers affected by the drought (use of intervention stocks, fodder transport aid) and to authorise supplementary national aid; 9. Deplores and highlights the fact that the current reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, uncoupling production aids and willing to deal with any of any of the most negative aspects of the old CAP, will contribute to set-aside and strengthen the trend towards rural desertification and thus encourage conditions favourable to large-scale forest fires; 10. Calls on the Commission to take steps to respect the Kyoto undertakings and develop research into relationship between pollution and climate change; 11. Stresses that this disaster also highlights the fact that the Stability Pact criteria are irrational when they place conditions on major public investment, in a situation which demands such investment, and therefore urges the Commission and Council to revise the Stability Pact; 12. Urges the Commission and Council to discount, as of now, all spending and public investment related to this disaster when calculating budgetary shortfall; 13. Calls on the Governments of the Member States to increase public spending on health and social protection, taking heed of the lessons to be learnt from this summer’s social and health disaster; 14. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Governments and parliaments of Member States and the candidate countries, and to the local authorities of the regions affected.
