ORAL QUESTION H-0486/05 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Luisa Morgantini to the Commission Subject: The technical arrangement on EU-Israel customs cooperation Since the technical arrangement on EU-Israel customs cooperation put into effect on 1 February 2005 was not adopted as a legally binding decision taken under the EU-Israel Association Agreement nor endorsed by the Association Council, is Israel under any legally binding contractual obligation to the European Community to continue implementing the arrangement, or is Israel legally entitled to abandon the arrangement at any time? Since both Israel's exporters and Israel's customs authorities must distinguish between production carried out in occupied territories and production carried out in the territory of the State of Israel in order to implement the technical arrangement correctly, has Israel taken any measure that now legally obligates either its exporters or its customs authorities to apply this distinction?
