health, employment, social services, justice, sports and culture, and also in the EU’s relations with third countries’; welcomes the request to the Commission to ‘undertake concrete steps to make Community instruments and policies relevant for Roma inclusion more effective’; 7. Expresses deep concern that, in view of the urgency of the matter, the European Commission has thus far not responded to its request of 28 January 2008 to prepare a European Strategy on Roma, in cooperation with the Member States, aimed at better coordinating and promoting efforts to improve the situation of the Roma population; 8. Looks forward to the European Commission’s communication to be presented after the next European Summit on Roma inclusion, which will examine the existing policies and instruments to improve Roma inclusion and the factors behind the unsatisfactory progress to date; calls for the communication to include clear objectives and mechanisms for the future designing of policy on Roma; 9. Calls on the new European Commissioners to prioritise the Roma‑related issues covered by their portfolios, while establishing as a priority an effective system of coordination between Commissioners and between Directorates-General to tackle Roma issues at EU level; calls on the Commission to designate one of its Commissioners as responsible for coordinating Roma policy; 10. Encourages the EU institutions to involve Roma communities, from the grassroots level up to that of NGOs participating in international consultation, into the process of developing a comprehensive EU policy on Roma, in all aspects of planning, implementation and supervision, and also to utilise the experiences of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005‑2015, the OSCE Action Plan, and the recommendations of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and Parliament itself; 11. Requests the Commission to take a horizontal approach to Roma issues and to develop additional proposals to deliver policy coherence at the European level regarding the social inclusion of Roma, to prompt Member States to greater efforts to achieve visible results, to encourage a critical analysis of policy failures, to facilitate the exchange of best practices between Member States and to harness all the lessons learnt from the Roma Pilot project, which should feed into the mainstream policies; 12. Encourages the Summit organiser and the EU to define a clear political follow-up to the Summit conclusions, in order to avoid previous situations where neither political conclusions nor concrete proposals were adopted; considers that the Summit should not be declarative in nature but should focus on strategic policy commitments that show a political will to close the gap between Roma communities and majority populations; 13. Urges the Commission and Council to make use of existing initiatives such as the Decade of Roma Inclusion to heighten the efficacy of efforts in this area; 14. Considers it essential that a complex development program be established that targets simultaneously all the related policy areas and makes immediate intervention possible in ghetto areas struggling with serious structural disadvantages; 15. Stresses that anti-discrimination measures alone are insufficient as a means of facilitating the social inclusion of Roma, but that a concerted Community effort on a firm legal basis
