Question for written answer E-001182/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (14 February 2011) Subject: Workplace standards and quality of life for EU citizens in border regions The EU has achieved major advances as regards its citizens' wellbeing, but not everyone enjoys the same standards of living and working conditions. This particularly applies to citizens living in border regions. The situation of certain people living in Catalonia and working in Andorra is giving rise to concern. As is known, Andorra is not part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and operates a welfare system different from that prevailing in most EU Member States. In particular, unemployment benefit does not exist in Andorra. The bilateral convention between Spain and Andorra only covers health services. The EURES programme, promoted by the Commission and the public employment services in the EEA, was created to improve the workings of the European labour market and encourage the international mobility of workers within the EEA. Although Andorra, as a non-EEA member, is not part of that programme, the cooperation agreement which it signed with the European Communities in 2004 includes, in its Article 5, an undertaking to ensure closer coordination in the social field in order to avoid any type of discrimination. This is a sufficient legal basis to enable Andorra to participate in the EURES programme. Given that Andorra is a small country which needs foreign labour to meet its employment requirements, does the Commission not believe that if Andorra became part of the EURES network, the situation of the EU citizens living in the border areas of Catalonia (Spain) and France who work in Andorra would be improved in terms of workplace standards and, therefore, quality of life?
