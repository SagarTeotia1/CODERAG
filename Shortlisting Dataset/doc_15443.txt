a time of austerity across Europe." Daniel Cohn-Bendit ( Greens/FR), also criticised the budget freeze and backed a financial transaction tax to increase the EU's own resources. "If you take 1% of all financial transactions you would have €20-30 billion. It would be a new tax and it would not be for the ordinary man to pay, but for the financial institutions that profit massively from the European Union." Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL/PT), doubted whether European politicians had learned their lessons from the financial crisis and said that Europe needed a real budget in order to solve its problems. He described the Commission budget proposal as a "real freezing of the EU budget". He stressed the importance of the introduction of a financial transaction tax and wondered why it had taken the Commission so many years to come out in support of this idea. Marta Andreasen (EFD/UK), was even more critical. The MFF is "an effective increase of 11%", she said, criticising the proposals as misleading and lacking in transparency. "The previous MFF was supposed to make the EU the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world and look what happened with that...is this supposed to get us out of the current crisis?" 20110701IPR23195 Watch the recording of the debate via the Video on Demand service (VOD) Commission proposal: "A Budget for Europe 2020" The EU budget in your country: new web tool Feature: The battle for the EU's long-term budget EN 1 LINK /wps-europarl-internet/frd/vod/research-by-date?language=en EN 2 LINK http://ec.europa.eu/budget/index_en.cfm EN 3 LINK /en/headlines/content/20110630MUN23022/html/EU-budget-at-glance EN 4 LINK /en/headlines/content/20110429FCS18370/html/The-battle-for-the-EU's-long-term-budget -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
