WRITTEN QUESTION E-1538/07 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (26 March 2007) Subject: Replacement of existing passports in Greece and respect for EU legislation In his answer to my Question E‑0042/07, Mr Barroso clearly states that all EU regulations take precedence over national legislation and have immediate and binding effect. However, the answer provided by the Commission to my Question E‑5711/06 is at odds with the answer provided by the Commission President. It is striking that the answers furnished by the Commissioners directly contradict each other. Furthermore, the Commission is selective in deciding whether a matter falls within its legal remit: this can be seen, for instance, in the case of Greek public sector contract workers; on the other hand, it did not intervene over the selection by the ASEP (Supreme Staff Recruitment Council) of personnel to staff the Greek public sector, even though this has been the subject of a large number of complaints. This selective approach can also be seen in the case of the violation of the property rights of 1.5 million Greeks and other Community citizens who are members of Greek building cooperatives: although the courts ruled in their favour, they are still unable to see the plots of land to which they are entitled. As regards the above two questions and the contradictory answers I have received from the Commission, it should be pointed out that the answer to Question E‑5711/06 may create a precedent which would not be particularly welcome to the EU and its institutions. In view of the above, will the Commission say: Is a Member State able to invalidate Community regulations by national rules? What measures will be taken to ensure that Commissioners do not in future give mutually contradictory answers, which totally confuse not only those familiar with Community law, but also and more importantly, ordinary citizens?
