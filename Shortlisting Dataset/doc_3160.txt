It also urges the Council to improve "EUFOR Althea's oversight of stockpiles in Bosnia-Herzegovina, by accelerating the destruction of stockpiles in the Balkans, and by helping the Iraqi authorities to 'mop up' surplus SALW [Small Arms and Light Weapons] through a large-scale disarmament, demobilisation and integration." MEPs call for engagement in "a dialogue with the USA" to seek "enhanced multilateralisation of the role played by the international community in the country, by using the UN framework." They also call on the "Multi-National Force - Iraq (MNF-I) to engage with the Government of Iraq and account for the situation of the over 24 000 detainees held in MNF-I custody, so as to ensure respect for due process and their basic human rights." MEPs also demand "clear guidelines for the use of private military and security companies by EU institutions," and "urge Turkey to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq and not react to terrorist actions through military actions on Iraqi territory." EU-Iraq relations MEPs call on the Council to "foster the renewal of bilateral political, diplomatic, cultural and economic relations and exchanges between Member States and Iraq," for instance by enlarging the financial envelope of the Erasmus Mundus programme for Iraq. Members also called for increasing "the size, responsibilities and resources of the Commission's delegation in Baghdad."
