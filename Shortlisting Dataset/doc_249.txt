Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (30 January 2007) The Commission is aware of concerns about the situation of stateless residents in Slovenia who have been removed from the population register. However, as regards the specific concerns relating to the conditions of acquisition of nationality in Slovenia raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission can only confirm its answer to the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑1641/03 according to which: ‘a nationality of a Member State is entirely a matter for the Member State concerned … It is therefore for each Member State, having due regard to Community law, to lay down the conditions for acquisition and loss of nationality’. Concerning Croatia, the Commission is aware of there being categories of permanent residents of Croatia who, in the early 1990s, had difficulties acquiring Croatian citizenship. However, the Commission is not aware of such difficulties persisting. As the nationality of a Member State is entirely a matter for the Member State concerned, this issue will not be subject to the accession negotiations with Croatia.
