EUR 57 million to EUR 74 million (+31%). Enlargement 80. This heading decreases from EUR 2, 2 billion in 2006 to a total of EUR 1, 1 billion in the PDB, which can be explained by the part of Bulgaria and Romania previously financed here. When this effect is removed, this heading in fact remains at largely the same level as in 2006. 81. Spending linked to negotiations with Turkey and Croatia is set to increase in coming budgets . Although it is no longer possible to see from the PDB budget lines how much assistance is actually budgeted for these, the Commission indicates in its working document that the increase for Turkey in 2006 did not yet take the intensified activities into account. The PDB 2007 presumably does, but the rapporteur would welcome further clarification. For Croatia, the Commission indicates that funding will remain essentially the same. 82. Also as concerns the Western Balkans, it is difficult see how much is budgeted for any specific country. It should be noted that funds for the EU reconstruction Agency will start to be phased out in 2007 as the EC delegations should now take over assistance from the IPA instrument. Additional information on the funding of this Agency is necessary. Humanitarian Aid 83. This policy area has remained more or less constant over the past three years in terms of appropriations for ECHO, with humanitarian aid and disaster preparedness totalling around EUR 500 million. This has not changed in the PDB. What is new is that Food Aid has been transferred to ECHO and included at EUR 218 million (previously under DG Development). The Emergency aid reserve, in previous years under the old heading 6, is also now included here and endowed with EUR 234 million in the PDB. Heading 5 - Administration 84. This heading concerns aspects related to the human resources and other administrative expenditure. There is a certain continuity in Heading 5 between the new MFF and the previous FP. The PDB presents for 2007 a budget of EUR 7 002 million, which leaves a margin of EUR 112,7 million once EUR 76 million of staff pension fund contributions have been taken into account. 85. The Commission's administrative budget for 2007 is estimated at EUR 4 360 million with pensions and the cost of European Schools included in the total. This represents an increase of 5.2% compared to B2006. Approximately 4% of the overall administrative budget is linked to recruitment for new posts. 86. The increase in appropriations is mainly due to the increase in staff recruited to deal with the increased work-load due to the enlargement. 840 new posts are directly linked to the enlargement (610 for EU-10 and 230 in view of the scheduled enlargement to Bulgaria and Romania (EU-2) on 1 January 2007). These numbers are complemented by 50 external staff (30 for EU-10 and 20 for EU-2) according to PDB document I (page 41). The request is in line with the multi-annual plan on enlargement needs presented by the Commission in its communication "Activities and human
