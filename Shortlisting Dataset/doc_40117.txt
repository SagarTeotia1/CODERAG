WRITTEN QUESTION E-1817/10 by João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 March 2010) Subject: Consequences of the European Emissions Trading Scheme The way in which the European Emissions Trading Scheme has operated since 2005 has led to a real increase in greenhouse gas emissions instead of the intended decrease, partly because of the crisis and the resulting drop in the ‘price’ of carbon on the markets. This real increase has only been obscured by the Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms. 1. What does the Commission have to say on the subject? 2. Does it not consider that the same could happen again and that this market instrument should therefore be abandoned?
