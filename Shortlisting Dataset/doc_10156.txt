for network access, Parliament agreed with the Commission that basic joint principles on access charges are necessary to eliminate existing cross-board trade barriers. MEPs share the opinion that charges or calculation methodologies should offer incentives to investment and keep the transmission systems interoperable. To ensure transparent and non-discriminatory tariffs, Parliament underlined the need for national regulation authorities to publish information relating to the tariff derivation, methodology and structure. Third Party Access standards are essential to ensure equal business opportunities, including new market entrants and small companies, say MEPs. Interoperability between different transmission systems at border points should be ensured by standardised interconnection and operational balancing agreements. The House also adopted an amendment avoiding TSO (Transmission system operators) circumventing the regulation through another company holding monopoly capacity rights. A company with monopoly long term capacity rights and wishing to sell or allocate services to third parties will have the same obligations as the transmission system operator of the pipeline for which those rights are held. Comitology For further adoption of binding guidelines, the draft regulation proposes the comitology procedure. MEPs stress the importance of the Commission consulting the Madrid Forum and European Group of Regulators . The comitology committee will have to consult transmission system operators, network users and gas consumers in delivering its opinion to the Commission. Entry into force The regulation should enter force on 1 July 2005. MEPs believe there should be no individual exceptions to this date.
