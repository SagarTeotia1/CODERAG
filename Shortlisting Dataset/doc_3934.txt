ORAL QUESTION H-0854/06 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Hélène Goudin to the Commission Subject: Euronews The Commission provides substantial sums to finance the TV channel Euronews. Euronews reaches viewers in 121 countries worldwide and its objective is to broadcast news from what is said to be a European perspective. The TV channel has been criticised for being biased and for mainly reporting on the EU from a positive and uncritical perspective. In a press release on 2 October 2006, Euronews announced that viewers in the USA now have access to the channel via an Internet-based TV service. Does the Commission consider that it is appropriate and responsible to use EU taxpayers' money to finance news broadcasts in the USA? What are the Commission's practical motives for financing Euronews? What amount of funding does the Commission provide annually for this controversial TV channel?
