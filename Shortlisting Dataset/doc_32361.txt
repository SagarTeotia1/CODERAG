Reply (6 June 2007) When the Presidency of the Council welcomed the formation of the Palestinian national unity government on 17 March 2007, it mentioned the EU's willingness to cooperate with a Palestinian government that adopted a platform reflecting the principles of the Quartet and to give it its support once more. In the Council conclusions of 23 April 2007, the EU recalled its readiness to work with and to resume its direct assistance to a Palestinian government whose policy and actions reflect the Quartet principles. In that context, the EU continues to closely evaluate the policy and actions of the new national unity government. It has initiated cooperation with members of the government who accept these principles. Mindful of the continuing needs of the Palestinian people, on 23 April 2007 the Council endorsed the extension of the temporary international mechanism (TIM) for a further three months. Moreover, the Council would point out that the EU provided combined assistance exceeding EUR 650 million in the course of 2006.
