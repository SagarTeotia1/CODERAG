information/analyses/systems are needed which cannot always be obtained on the market. The nuclear activities of the JRC aim to satisfy the R&D requirements to support both Commission and Member States . The objective of this programme is to develop and assemble knowledge, to provide input to the debate on nuclear energy production, its safety and reliability, its sustainability and control, its threats and challenges, including innovative/future reactor systems. Justification Same justification as Amendment 4. Amendment 20 Annex 1, Nuclear Activities of the Joint Research Centre, Activities Activities deleted The JRC activities will focus on: Nuclear Waste Management and Environmental Impact aiming to understand the nuclear fuel processes from production of energy to waste storage and to develop effective solutions for the management of high level nuclear waste following the two major options (direct storage or partitioning and transmutation); Nuclear Safety, in implementing research on existing as well as on new fuel cycles and on reactor safety of both Western and Russian reactor types as well as on new reactor design. In addition the JRC will contribute and co-ordinate the European contribution to the Generation IV International Forum R&D initiative, in which the best research organisations in the world are involved; Justification Same justification as Amendment 4. Amendment 21 Annex II, Funding Schemes, 1. Funding Schemes in Fusion Energy 1. FUNDING SCHEMES IN FUSION ENERGY deleted In the field of fusion energy research, the particular nature of the activities in the area necessitates the implement a tion of specific arrangements. Financial support will be given to activities carried out on the basis of procedures set out in: 1.1 The Contracts of Association, between the Commission and Member States or fully Associated Third States or entities within Member States or fully Associated Third States which provide for the execution of part of the EU fusion energy research programme according to Article 10 of the Treaty; 1.2 The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA), a multilateral agreement concluded between the Commission and organisations in, or acting for, Member States and Associated States providing inter alia the framework for further research on fusion technology in associated organisations and in industry, use of the JET facilities and the European contribution to international cooperation; 1.3 The European Joint Undertaking for ITER, based on the provisions of Article 45-51, Chapter 5, Title II of the Treaty; 1.4 International agreements between Euratom and third countries covering activities in the field of fusion energy research and development, in particular the ITER Agreement; 1.5 Any other multilateral agreement concluded between the Community and associated organisations, in particular the Agreement on Staff Mobility; 1.6 Cost -sharing actions to promote and contribute to fusion energy research with bodies in the Member States or the States associated with the Euratom framework programme in which there is no Contract of Association. In addition to the above activities, actions to promote and develop human resources, fellowships, integrated infrastructures initiatives as well as specific support actions may be undertaken in particular to coordinate fusion energy research, to undertake studies in support of these activities, to support publications, information exchange;
