D-BY Presentation and competencies The European Parliament delegation for relations with Belarus, established in 1994, does not have at present official relations with the parliament or the government of the regime in Belarus, due to its failure to conduct free and fair elections, to establish rule of law and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people in Belarus. However, the delegation maintains an active and close dialogue with the representatives of the democratic opposition, of the independent nongovernmental organizations and of the civil society of Belarus. Due to the repeatedly refused entrance visas by the authorities in Minsk, the delegation has been unable to travel to Belarus in recent years, however it meets regularly in Brussels and in Strasbourg to discuss the developments in the EU policy towards Belarus, to assess the political and economic situation in Belarus as well as to provide recommendations to the Council of the EU and the European Commission regarding possible further steps to improve the situation of democracy, human rights and rule of law in Belarus and to move this important neighbouring country closer to the EU. 20071218DDE16023
