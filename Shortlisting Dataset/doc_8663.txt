WRITTEN QUESTION E-2646/05 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE-DE) to the Commission (18 July 2005) Subject: Extension of Erasmus programme to non-EU universities Following the remarkable success of the Erasmus programme, many are now asking when it will be extended to non‑EU universities. In particular, in the US and Latin America numerous possibilities exist which could amply satisfy many university students who might wish to complete their studies at institutions across the Atlantic. Can the Commission give an idea of its expectations on the matter and comment on the possibility of extending the Erasmus programme to universities outside the EU?
