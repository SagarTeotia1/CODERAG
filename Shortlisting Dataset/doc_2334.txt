WRITTEN QUESTION E-0271/07 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (31 January 2007) Subject: Pets and air transport At the present time, the regulations governing the transport of pets by air vary significantly. Some airlines prohibit them, others allow them but charge a freight rate, while others still charge a specific, standard fare. Does the Commission intend to harmonise the regulations governing the transport of pets by air to enable both pets and owners to enjoy tolerable conditions of transport?
