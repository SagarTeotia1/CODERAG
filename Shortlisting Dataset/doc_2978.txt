WRITTEN QUESTION E-6686/09 by Axel Voss (PPE) to the Commission (13 January 2010) Subject: Gas canister system in Europe In many areas of the European Union gas canisters are used in households. Above all, however, they are needed by many Europeans for camping holidays. As there are restrictions on transporting gas canisters because of safety rules, there is often the problem of having to refill them locally. Although a European adapter set has been introduced, there are no uniform rules on possibilities for refilling. Each Member State has adopted different regulations. Often gas cylinders cannot be filled at petrol stations, and it is necessary to look for special centres, which, however, are not to be found in all areas visited. 1. Does the Commission intend to take further steps to bring about harmonisation in this area? 2. Does the Commission not consider it desirable to ensure that gas canisters can be filled in all Member States?
