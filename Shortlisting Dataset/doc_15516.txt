(02 02 09) and the proposed pilot project on " Energy security - biofuels" (06 04 07) each have € 5 million in commitments. Taking these two proposals into account, €29 million would remain for pilot projects in the 2007 budget. 14. The European Parliament did not agree to either of these Council proposals at the 14 July conciliation. Further, they strongly criticise the Council for making proposals that would use up such a significant proportion of the commitment appropriations available as regards an aspect of the budget procedure that has traditionally allowed the European Parliament room to come forward with its own proposals. Amounts available - preparatory actions 15. For PAs, the IIA sets a limit of € 50 million for commitments for new PAs in any given budget year and an overall limit of € 100 million for total annual commitments. The Council's DB did not change the PDB 2007 as regards PAs. Commitments appropriations for PAs total € 3.3 million. This leaves € 46.7 million for new PAs in the 2007 budget and a margin of € 96.7 million beneath the overall commitments ceiling. Proposals for the 2007 budget procedure 16. In terms of the approach to PPs and APs for the 2007 budget, paragraph 23 of the mandate report, adopted in the committee on budgets for the July 14 conciliation, "considers that rationalisation and concentration should be an objective for the 2007 budget" in order to ensure a better level of implementation of EP proposals by the Commission. Furthermore, following the priorities set out in paragraph 6 of the APS resolution ( A6-0154/2006 ), it seems logical to follow a thematic approach in selecting particular PPs and PAs. III - PPs and PAs from previous budget procedures 17. As noted in the introduction, this section of the working document has been prepared under the authority of Gianni Pittella, general rapporteur for Budget 2006. The 2006 budget includes about 35 pilot projects and preparatory actions, some continued from 2005 and, others, created in 2006. It is naturally not possible to give comments on all the projects in this report. The rapporteur would therefore like to highlight the annexed overview tables provided by the Commission and the Parliament's secretariat and focus on a few selected projects that were much discussed in the 2006 procedure. 18. Members will find in annex 1 the table on PP/ PAs provided by the Commission. It should be noted that for most PP/ PAs, the preparations leading up to a grant payment, following a call for proposals, will be at least 6 months or so. In the cases of procurement (calls-for-tender) the procedures will be even longer and seldom leading to any payments or not even commitments, in the first year. The rapporteur however recalls the early cooperation with the Commission on PP/PAs in the 2006 procedure and expects that this will be reflected in the results and implementation figures at the end of the year. 19. The purpose of this document is not to discuss PP/PAs for 2007 but, for consistency, the rapporteur considers
