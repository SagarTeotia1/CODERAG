WRITTEN QUESTION E-1038/05 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE) to the Commission (16 March 2005) Subject: Community funding for the outer harbour of A Coruña In its reply to written question P-0063/05 the Commission said that it had not yet received the Spanish Government’s amended proposal adapting the original proposal to the financial framework of the Cohesion Fund, nor any request to include the project in the operational programme for Galicia. 1. Has the Commission already received the new proposal from the Spanish Government adapted to the financial framework of the Cohesion Fund? If so, can it state the date and the amount? Is it confined to Cohesion Fund co-financing or does it extend to other funds? If so, which ones and for what amount? 2. Bearing in mind the amount left over and the commitments for projects already approved, are approximately EUR 950 million still available out of the allocation for Spain under the Cohesion Fund until the end of the period (2006)? If not, can the Commission say what new approved projects have reduced this amount?
