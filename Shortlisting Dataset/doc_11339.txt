Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (15 March 2012) The EU has been active funding international NGOs working on the removal of unexploded ordnances, arms and ammunition scattered in former areas of fighting. The EU is equally making use of ongoing EU‑funded projects with civil society in Libya to raise awareness regarding disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration among civil society actors and, through them, the population at large. At the same time it regularly discusses the disarmament process with the authorities directly. The EU supports the current efforts undertaken by the interim government in bringing the country through the difficult process of transition towards the election of a National Council scheduled for June 2012. Beyond tackling the most pressing humanitarian needs, the EU is already preparing both immediate measures to support the stabilisation priorities of the Interim Government as well as longer-term support programmes. Already nearly EUR 30 million has been made available, in addition to EUR 80.5 million for humanitarian assistance. The EU remains committed to helping Libya and other countries in the region undertake a process of democratic transition. The EU regularly discusses the developing situation in Libya with regional and other international partners as part of its general dialogue with them.
