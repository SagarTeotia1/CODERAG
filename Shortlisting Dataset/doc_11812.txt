WRITTEN QUESTION E-2614/04 by Umberto Guidoni (GUE/NGL) and Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (25 October 2004) Subject: On-the-job fatalities Every day and increasingly frequently accidents occur at the workplace. Every day, more and more people are being killed, seriously injured or disabled. In Italy alone there are now four industrial deaths a day. These industrial accidents are due on the one hand to failure on the part of businesses to comply with requirements concerning the safety of workers, and on the other hand to the hectic increase in the pace of work and in workloads. It is for these reasons that such accidents are called ‘omicidi bianchi’ (white collar killings) in Italy. Since the Commission needs legal bases on which to take action in this area, it might view the differences between Member State provisions in this area, including those in respect of criminal liability, as resulting in the distortion of competition rules. What action will the Commission take to harmonise legislation on safety at the workplace, the criminal liability of negligent employers who cause on-the-job fatalities and compensation for victims' families, in order to put an end to these killings?
