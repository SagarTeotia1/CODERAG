Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (7 July 2006) The effectiveness of the protection of Natura 2000 sites is related to a number of factors, notably the extent to which sites have been formally recognised under Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. and Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. as well as the adequacy of the content and application of the relevant national implementing legislation. With regard to the recognition of Natura 2000 sites, the Commission has been closely involved with the Member States in the evaluation of their national site proposals. Commission Decision 2004/813/EC of 7 December 2004 adopting, pursuant to Council Directive 92/43/EEC, the list of sites of Community importance for the Atlantic biogeographical region OJ L 387, 29.12.2004. assures the application of the protection regime of the directive to a large number of Natura 2000 sites for both Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Commission has also evaluated the content of national implementing legislation in respect to both Ireland and the United Kingdom and has made representations to the authorities of both Member States requesting improvements in this legislation including with direct relevance to Natura 2000 protection. Article 17 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC requires Member States to report on their implementation of measures under the directive. The next report, due in 2007, will include national assessments on the conservation status of species and habitat types and should provide an important basis for assessing the contribution of Natura 2000 to their maintenance or restoration to favourable conservation status. The Commission will carry out a comprehensive review of this information to assess the effectiveness of implementation.
