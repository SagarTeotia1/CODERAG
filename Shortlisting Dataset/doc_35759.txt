Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (14 November 2003) According to the information available to the Commission, the measures already adopted by the Union in the wake of the Erika and Prestige accidents do not apply to shipments of end-of life ships. However, the commitment made in Johannesburg to protect our vulnerable marine environment and the experience learned from the Erika , Prestige and Tricolor disasters should lead us to a precautionary approach. Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community applies to all shipments of waste, and thus also to these end-of life ships. According to information submitted to the Commission, the end-of life ships are intended to be recovered in the United Kingdom. According to the Regulation, the countries involved in such a shipment, i.e. the countries of dispatch, destination and transit, all have to consent to the shipment. It thus follows that all the competent authorities involved can oppose the shipment. A pre-condition to receive a consent from the competent authorities, in particular that of destination, is that the treatment facility is authorised and has adequate technical capacity to treat the waste in question under conditions presenting no danger to human health and to the environment. The Commission has received a complaint in this regard and is investigating the complaint as a matter of urgency with the United Kingdom authorities. The latest information at the Commission's disposal would suggest that the United Kingdom authorities are currently evaluating the situation with regard to the permit of the receiving company. Finally, should the end-of life ships be intended for disposal, Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 provides that the Community only imports the waste concerned if the exporting country does not have the capacity to treat the waste itself.
