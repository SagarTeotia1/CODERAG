WRITTEN QUESTION E-4843/08 by Colm Burke (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 September 2008) Subject: Aquaculture zonation plans The LIFE programme was designed to ensure a sustainable balance between human activity and protection of natural habitats, with both socioeconomic and environmental benefits accruing. As part of this, aquaculture zonation plans (AZPs) were to be drawn up and completed by national competent authorities in order to ensure this balance. I therefore ask the Commissioner to furnish me with the following details; — In what form was the Irish Government informed of the availability of funding for AZPs? — Was the Irish Government informed as to the time-limit put in place as regards applying for and drawing down funding? — What amount of funding was applied for by the Irish Government, and what amount of the total available was returned unspent by the Irish Government? — What was the maximum funding available to the Irish Government for the completion of these plans? — How many completed AZPs were returned to the Commission by the Irish Government? — Of these plans, were any carried out and completed for the area of Castlemaine Harbour in Co. Kerry, Ireland?
