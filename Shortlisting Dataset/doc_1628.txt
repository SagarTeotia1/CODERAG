WRITTEN QUESTION E-3912/07 by Avril Doyle (PPE‑DE) and John Bowis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (1 August 2007) Subject: Biodiversity — controlling the spread of invasive alien species Further to the resolution adopted by the European Parliament in May 2007 on ‘Halting the Loss of Biodiversity by 2010’ ( P6_TA(2007)0195 ), we would like to draw attention to paragraph 46 of that resolution which states the following: ‘Highlights the fact that immunocontraception (IMC) could play a decisive role in the control of mammalian IAS and notes the important research currently underway in this field; urges the Commission to allocate financing for European research into immunocontraception (IMC) and to issue a call for project proposals; notes that the LIFE + Programme is one existing framework that could be utilised to better effect to encourage action on IAS.’ Given the clear political will on this issue, can the Commission state whether specific funds will be made available through FP7 or LIFE+ for work to be done on IMC to control invasive animal species and whether a call for project proposals to that effect will be issued?
