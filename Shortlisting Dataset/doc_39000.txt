Reply (1 June 2006) The various actions conducted by the European Community in the field of culture already represent a policy in its own right. Cultural aspects have to be taken into account in the Community's other policies in order to promote the diversity of its cultures. It is only natural that these actions should be carried out in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in as much as the relevant provisions of the Treaty provide that the Community should contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity. Within this context, the value of the actions undertaken in the field of culture has been widely recognised by the different stakeholders concerned.
