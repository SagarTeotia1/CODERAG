Question for written answer E-8675/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 David Casa (PPE) (26 October 2010) Subject: Traineeships and internships MEP Emilie Turunen’s Draft report on promoting youth access to the labour market, strengthening trainee, internship and apprenticeship status (2009/2221(INI)), tabled on behalf of the EMPL Committee, claims that there is a tendency to abuse young workers who take part in traineeships and internships across the EU. It can be argued that various organisations see such activities as an opportunity to obtain inexpensive temporary labour rather than an opportunity to train and subsequently retain young workers. The draft report suggests that a system should be put in place to regularise such activities within a framework that would limit abuse. One solution could be that of introducing a voluntary code of conduct and subsequently accrediting those organisations that adhere to the code, thereby giving internships or traineeships at such organisations more value. Is the Commission considering such an initiative? What legal concerns are there in relation to the implementation of such a code of conduct? With respect to the principle of subsidiarity, is it best implemented and supervised at EU rather than domestic level?
