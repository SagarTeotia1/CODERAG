WRITTEN QUESTION E-6897/08 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (22 December 2008) Subject: Illegal exploitation of patent rights by Samsung In the United States, Kodak has accused Samsung, the technology leader, of violating US patent legislation. The Korean company is being accused, in particular, of making unauthorised use of image-capture and data compression and conservation technologies for its mobile phones and wireless applications. Samsung is also the target of another accusation from Spansion, which claims that it is guilty of patent infringement on certain components of flash memories in mobile phones, mp3 players and digital cameras. Flash memories are contained in virtually all electronic equipment and are one of the most important segments of the semiconductor industry, with total revenues of around 130 billion since 2000, making them a leading market. Given that Samsung also operates in Europe, with a sizeable share of the market (and sizeable profits), does the Commission not consider that it should carry out an investigation, alongside that of the International Trade Commission, to check whether there has in fact been a violation of intellectual property rights? If so, what measures will it take to restore normal market conditions?
