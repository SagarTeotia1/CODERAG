cases and urges the Commission to draw up a harmonised compensation application form, in all Community languages, which could be used for communication between the various Member State authorities. Convention on child custody to enter into force as soon as possible Marie-Thérèse HERMANGE (EPP-ED, F) Report on the Commission proposal for a Council decision authorising the Member States to ratify, or accede to, in the interest of the European Community the Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (the 1996 Hague Convention) ( COM(2003) 348 – C5-0302/2003 – 2003/0127(CNS)) Doc.: A5-0319/2003 Procedure : Consultation Debate : 21.10.2003 Reporting for the Citizens' Rights Committee, Marie Thérèse HERMANGE (EPP-ED, F) will be tabling non-binding amendments seeking to ensure that the Hague Convention on child custody in the event of divorce enters into force as soon as possible. Many, if not most, problems relating to child abduction and rights of access arise in countries outside the European Union. The incorporation of the Hague Convention into EU law will therefore make a real contribution to strengthening Community law on child protection, the rapporteur says. Budgets Successful enlargement - the priority for 2004 budget Giovanni PITTELLA (PES, I) Report on the Structural Funds: trend in outstanding commitments and requirements for 2004 (2002/2272(INI)) Doc.: A5-0286/2003 Procedure : Own-initiative report & Jan MULDER (ELDR, NL) Report on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2004 ( C5-0300/2003 – 2003/2001(BUD)) Section III – Commission Doc.: A5-0349/2003 Procedure : Budgetary & Neena GILL (PES, West Midlands) Report on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2004 ( C5-0300/2003 – 2003/2002(BUD)) Doc.: A5-0350/2003 Procedure : Budgetary Debate : 21.10.2003 For the Budgets Committee, Jan MULDER (ELDR, NL) and Neena GILL (PES, West Midlands) are putting forward draft resolutions at first reading of the 2004 EU Budgets. The main concerns of MEPs have not changed since the drafting of the 2003 budget: they stress above all that the Community must have sufficient funding to make a success of enlargement. Main points of the Mulder resolution on the general budget (Section III - Commission) Regarding agricultural expenditure (former Heading 1), far more emphasis should be placed on the environment. Greater transparency is needed, both on the origin of products and for consumer information. Funds should be earmarked for estimating whether the eradication of contagious animal diseases can be covered by an insurance system, as already happens in some Member States. Animal welfare is an area that continues to trouble MEPs, who wish to keep the distinction between export refunds for live cattle and export refunds for beef meat. Structural measures (Heading 2) are to receive increased payment appropriations, despite the endemic problem of "outstanding commitments". Parliament still awaits information from the Commission as to what payments can still be made under the Structural Funds and what funding will be lost. The problem of the outstanding commitments is dealt with in a separate report by Gianni PITTELLA (PES, I), which will
