WRITTEN QUESTION E-5760/08 by María Sornosa Martínez (PSE) to the Commission (27 October 2008) Subject: Environmental reports in Valencia It has come to my attention that, in some cases, environmental impact statements (EIS) have not been published in the Official Journal of the Valencian Regional Government — e.g. the Official Journal of 2 September 2008, which contains environmental impact statements adopted in November 2006, or in other words almost 2 years previously. Those statements set out the environmental requirements that must be fulfilled by, amongst others, property developers involved in any urban development project. This practice could obscure information on the EISs adopted, and might therefore constitute a violation of the right of access to environmental information. Does the Commission not consider this to be a potential infringement of Community legislation? Does it not feel this to be in breach of the Aarhus Convention?
