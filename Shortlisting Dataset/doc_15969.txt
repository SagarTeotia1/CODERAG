The House confirms its objective is to have a multiannual financial framework for the period after 2006. MEPs recall that the EU Treaty does not provide for any legal obligation to have a financial perspective. The House also recalls that an agreement between Parliament and the Council is necessary in order to have a financial perspective beyond 2006, as the two institutions are placed on an equal footing. MEPs call on the European Council to instruct the forthcoming Presidencies to continue the inter-institutional dialogue through regular consultations with Parliament, with a view to ensuring that a successful conclusion is reached on this matter, preferably under the Luxembourgish Presidency. Parliament insists that the timetable for decision-making procedures should be such as to avoid any breaks in the multiannual programmes and the rate of commitment and payment of appropriations, such as those that occurred at the beginning of the current financial perspective period. Finally, MEPs demand that monthly trialogues be organised to ensure an effective exchange of information on the ongoing internal discussions leading to the respective common positions, including, in due course, on the issue of own resources.

The biometric data will ensure that a person presenting a passport is in fact the person to whom the passport was originally issued. However, the EP believes that the implementation of biometric elements must not infringe upon privacy and data protection rights. This is why the EP opposes the setting up of a central database of European Union passports and travel documents
