Question for written answer E-010311/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (14 December 2010) Subject: Failure to market the substance Fludrocortisone in Portugal No drugs are available on the Portuguese market containing the active substance (INN) Fludrocortisone, a synthetic corticosteroid (mineralcorticoid) which is generally used to replace the hormone aldosterone in the treatment of Addison's disease. Since Addison's patients have to take Fludrocortisone daily in order to contain the disease, Portuguese patients are obliged to go to Spain to acquire it, and are indeed advised to do so by the health professionals. This is neither a new nor a particularly expensive medicine. A single package of 40 pills Fludrocortisone pills (marketed by Merck S.L. under the brand-name Astonín) may be acquired on prescription in Spain for EUR 4.68 (https://sinaem4.agemed.es/consaem/especialidad.do?metodo=verPresentaciones&codigo=48921). — Is the Commission aware of this situation? — In view of the powers conferred on the Union by Article 6 TFEU in the area of the protection and improvement of human health, what measures does the Commission believe it could consider with a view to protecting the right of Portuguese Addison's patients to obtain the medicines necessary for their treatment in Portugal, and, in particular, ensuring that Fludrocortisone is available on the market?
