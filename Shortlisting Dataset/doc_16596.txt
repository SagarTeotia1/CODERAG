Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (28 February 2007) The World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) sets out in Article 3 that all subsidies within the meaning of Article 1 are prohibited if they are contingent upon export performance or contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods. They are deemed to be specific in accordance with Article 2.3 of the agreement. No exception is provided. However, the agreement on agriculture provides special rules for agricultural products. 1 and 3. WTO Members are required to notify their specific subsidies (including those falling under Article 3 ASCM) to the WTO. The EC do not keep a database of specific subsidies granted by other Members. Members' subsidy notifications are however available on the WTO website at http://www.wto.org/gen_home.asp 2 and 3. As there is no obligation on WTO Members to notify subsidies to the WTO which are not specific, there are no data available. However, the WTO Secretariat's ‘World trade report 2006: Subsidies, trade and the WTO’ provides extensive information about subsidies at different levels of geographical and sectoral disaggregation granted by WTO Members. This report does not distinguish between permitted and prohibited subsidies and is available at http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/world_trade_report_e.htm.
