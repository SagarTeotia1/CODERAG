Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (14 June 2010) By Decision 2006/923/EC OJ L 354, 14.12.2006, p. 42 . , the Commission granted EUR 8 417 million to Portugal to establish a ‘clear cut belt’ area in the area of Setubal, i.e. a zone free of coniferous trees that are susceptible to pinewood nematode. An advance payment of EUR 2 million in 2007, followed by a balance payment of EUR 4 741 million in 2008, i.e. a total of EUR 6 741 million, were paid to Portugal linked to the creation of the clear cut belt. The reason for which Portugal did not request the totality of EUR 8 417 million granted by Decision 2006/923/EC is that the financial documentation submitted by Portugal in 2008 did not, for certain categories of expenditure, provide enough paid bills to reach the initially foreseen co-financing.
