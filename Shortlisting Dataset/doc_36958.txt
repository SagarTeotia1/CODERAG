Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2012) The EU supports developing countries mainly through support to health sector reforms and health systems strengthening at country level in addition to thematic support addressing core health issues (as human resources for health, sustainable financing, access to medicine and so on). EU support to the global health initiatives (GF/GAVI) complements this strategy. Support to the health sector is about EUR 600 million per year, not counting general budget support which can also serve the same objectives. EU support for the fight against HIV/AIDS is mostly channelled through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) in its fight against poverty-related diseases. So far more than EUR 922 million has been disbursed to GFATM. HIV/AIDS represents 54 % of the GFATM portfolio by disease and the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa regions represent 56 % of the GFATM portfolio by region. This support is complemented by about EUR 250 million for HIV/AIDS over the last decade, more than two thirds of which goes to sub-Saharan Africa, to help organisations at country level run activities to complement the main country policy. Moreover, during the Sixth and Seventh Research Framework Programme (2002-2011), a total EU contribution of EUR 205 million was given to collaborative research on HIV/AIDS and an additional more than EUR 110 million to a European and Developing Countries Trial Partnership (EDCTP) specifically with sub-Saharan Africa.
