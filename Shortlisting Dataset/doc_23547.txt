Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2009) Under EU consumer protection law, and in particular under Directive 2005/29/EC Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 149, 11.6.2005. on Unfair Commercial Practices, traders selling second-hand cars to consumers must not mislead them as regards the main characteristics of the car and must not omit material information consumers need to take their purchase decision. For example, omitting to inform a consumer that a car was involved in an accident might constitute a misleading omission under the directive. However, it is exclusively the task of the national authorities and courts to apply the national laws implementing the directive, to assess whether the omission of certain information constitutes a misleading practice on a case by case basis. On the other hand, consumer-to-consumer sales are not covered by this directive and the Commission does not intend to take a view on private commercial initiatives of the kind mentioned by the Honourable Member.
