efforts should be made towards this type of complementary accreditation or assessment by an international agency listed on the European register, which should accordingly be promoted by the Member States. F. European dimension The European added value of QA/accreditation will emerge only from closer cooperation between the Member States and their agencies. Your rapporteur therefore supports cooperation on QA/accreditation, which represents an important step on the way to mutual recognition of educational and training qualifications. At the same time she stresses the need for the national QA and accreditation systems to mesh in with the corresponding European accreditation mechanisms. The objective of mutual recognition of QA systems and QA and accreditation assessments can only be achieved in the long term if the necessary trust is created between the competent agencies. The cooperation objectives of the EU Member States should be set as clearly and as ambitiously as in the Bologna process, not least with regard to dual diplomas and access to the European labour market.
