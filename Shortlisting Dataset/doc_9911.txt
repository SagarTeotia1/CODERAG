to more equity investment, which would both signal the EBRD's willingness to promote the development of local firms in the medium and long term with much needed risk capital and to develop public markets for such investments with increasing local participation; 14. Recommends that the EBRD pursue an integrated approach designed to help entire value-added chains – from the processing of raw materials to the sale of the product at local level – get established, and thus contribute to the promotion of regional economic and social flows; 15. Recommends that the EBRD take account of the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, as added to by the conclusions of the Göteborg European Council, when considering, monitoring and assessing the projects it finances; 16. Calls on the EBRD to step up its investment in municipal projects, particularly where better utility services for the public, at reasonable prices, can be achieved by improving the management of public utility companies; 17. Recommends that the EBRD make more resources available for the internal development of technical know-how relating to industry, with the aim of developing its staff's ability to identify promising projects with certainty and of having solid expertise available for the companies financed by the Bank, especially as (quite correctly) many of its staff come from the client countries on short term contracts and whose return to their own country will be of significant benefit; 18. Recommends that the EBRD use its experience in dealing with firms with liquidity problems to provide competent support for firms which, through no fault of their own, are suffering losses owing to the weakness of economic activity; 19. Calls on the EBRD to check, in connection with projects leading to rationalisation measures (especially in the production sector), whether local social security systems are sufficiently well-developed to provide for large numbers of temporary unemployed; calls on the EBRD to link restructuring measures to micro-loans and risk capital for those starting up businesses and made redundant by rationalising industries; 20. Recommends that the EBRD extend its network of local representations and set up regional offices, especially in Russia and the Ukraine, where there are huge regional disparities; 21. Applauds the thorough critical assessment process , which is carried out by the EBRD project evaluation department after projects are completed and which measures development of competition, enlargement of the market, development of institutions, knowledge transfer, demonstration effects and standards of sound business management; calls on the EBRD to include effects on employment as an additional criterion in project assessment; 22. Considers that the EBRD, by concentrating projects in one region, can create cluster synergy effects which increase the value of each individual investment made; advises the EBRD to implement such a strategy in a number of particularly needy areas, but also to build on already successful or nascent clusters wherever they are located so that their success can ripple outwards; notes that Kaliningrad is now expected to need extra support when the Baltic States become members of the EU because of its extreme poverty and serious concerns about rising crime; 23.
