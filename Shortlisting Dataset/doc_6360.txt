WRITTEN QUESTION E-3847/05 by Diana Wallis (ALDE) to the Commission (21 October 2005) Subject: Joint consumer actions in EU cross-border cases Will the Commission acknowledge that the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C- 89/91 ( Shearson Lehman Hutton , [1993], I-139) is having a detrimental effect on the ability of EU consumers to seek redress as a class by means of the assignment of their individual actions to a consumer association? Does the Commission agree that, under that judgment, an association is unlikely to be able to benefit from the legal order which is more favourable to consumers, as set out in the Brussels Regulation and the Lugano Convention, and that this creates a discrimination between consumers who may have ordered goods or services within their own Member State and those who have taken advantage of the internal market and done the same via another Member State? On the basis that the Commission acknowledges that there is a problem, as evidenced by cases currently pending in the Austrian courts of which the Commission is aware, what action does the Commission intend to take?
