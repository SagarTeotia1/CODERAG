ORAL QUESTION H-0220/03 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Camilo Nogueira Román to the Council Subject: Administering Iraq, in the event of a post-war US and UK occupation of the country What position would the European Council take should the USA and UK occupy Iraq? Would the European Council’s position be, as it must, that the administration of Iraq by the USA and UK is illegal and contrary to international law? Would the European Council demand that this role be played by the UN, on a transitional basis, in order to transfer the government of Iraq to the Iraqis themselves?
