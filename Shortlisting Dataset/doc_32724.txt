Question for Question Time H-0641/2010 to the Commission Part-session: January 2011 Rule 116 Andreas Schwab (PPE) Subject: EU funding for Chinese State-owned construction firms A 50 km section of the A2 motorway between Warsaw and Lodz is currently being built in Poland. Funding for this project is being provided through the EU’s Structural Funds and a loan from the EIB. Poland’s Department for National Roads and Motorways awarded the contract to build this motorway section to a consortium of Chinese State-owned construction firms known collectively as ‘COVEC’. In the face of competition with European construction firms, the prices quoted by the Chinese tenderer were less than half the contracting authority’s cost estimate and one third less than the price quoted by its nearest competitor. The Chinese tenderer was allowed to take part in this invitation to tender even though, for the most part, European firms are excluded from procurement procedures in China and the Chinese market remains firmly insulated from virtually any foreign competition in the construction industry. Will the Commission use all legal means available to it on the basis of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), which the EU has signed along with a number of non-Member States? In the Commission’s opinion, should China, which has not signed the GPA, be dealt with in the same way as a GPA signatory country? What is the Commission doing to convince China that it should accede to the GPA?
