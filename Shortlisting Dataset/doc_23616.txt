2004/C 782 E/083 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2711/03 by Kathleen Van Brempt (PSE) to the Commission (11 September 2003) Subject: Free-base nicotine American scientists from the University of Oregon (Oregon Health and Science University) have measured the free-base nicotine content of cigarettes. The tobacco industry has so far refused to make these figures public. Free-base nicotine causes the addiction to cigarettes. The higher the free-base nicotine content, the quicker smokers get their nicotine kick. According to the researchers, some brands are up to 20 times more addictive than others. The American brand American Spirit, for instance, contains 36 % of free-base nicotine. The Marlboro brand contains 10 % free-base nicotine, Gauloises Blondes 7,5 % and in Camel cigarettes researchers found 2,7 % free-base nicotine. Is the Commission aware of this research? What conclusions does it draw from this new data? What does the Commission think of the Netherlands proposal that tobacco manufacturers should be required to publish all their ingredients? Does the Commission support the proposal that cigarette packets should indicate which ingredients are addictive?
