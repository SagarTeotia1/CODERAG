safeguards have been strengthened further in this directive. Article 31(4) of Directive 2004/38/EC provides that the host Member State may exclude the individuals concerned from its territory pending the redress procedure against the expulsion decision, but it may not prevent them from submitting their defence in person, except when their appearance may cause serious troubles to public policy or public security. Article 32 of Directive 2004/38/EC provides that persons excluded on grounds of public policy or public security may submit an application for lifting of the exclusion order after a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances, and in any event after three years from enforcement of the final exclusion order which has been validly adopted in accordance with Community law, by putting forward arguments to establish that there has been a material change in the circumstances which justified the decision ordering their exclusion. The Member State concerned shall reach a decision on this application within six months of its submission but while their application is being considered, the persons concerned shall have no right of entry to the territory of the Member State concerned. The information provided in the written question is not sufficient to conclude whether or not Cyprus has properly complied with the above provisions of Community law in this particular case. In order to examine that, Mr Gray should provide us with a more detailed description of the whole case.
