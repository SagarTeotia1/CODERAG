Question for written answer E-009344/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jens Rohde (ALDE) (18 October 2011) Subject: Exemption from value-added tax (VAT) for Danish clubs and societies On 1 December 2010, in its Green Paper, the Commission called on the Danish Government to do away with VAT exemption for non-profit-making and charitable clubs and societies run by volunteers, since it considers that the practice distorts competition. A number of Danish sports clubs run the risk of having to close down if the Commission does not accept their VAT-exempt status. According to the Danish Sports Federation (DIF), this will have serious consequences for some of the smaller clubs, since they will have to increase membership fees, losing members in the process. In addition, it is already very difficult to attract volunteers to run sports clubs. The prospect of having to produce complicated VAT accounts will make this even more difficult, in particular as regards filling the posts of chairman and treasurer. Of the 1 400 clubs which took part in a DIF-conducted survey, one in three replied that changing the rules would mean more hours of work for volunteers running clubs. More than one in five clubs took the view that paid staff would have to be recruited in order to produce VAT accounts. For the time being, therefore, the Danish Government is refusing to act on the Commission’s call for VAT exemption to be done away with. Does the Commission take the view that abolishing VAT exemption for Danish sports clubs will not harm the smaller clubs? Would the Commission be willing to abandon its call if in its view, as a result of ending VAT exemption for volunteer-run sports clubs, members and volunteers would demonstrably be lost, thus harming sport at local level?
