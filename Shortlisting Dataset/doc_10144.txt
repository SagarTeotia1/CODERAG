They take especially into account the concerns related to land purchase with LIFE financing and the avoidance of double funding. The amendments are part of a first reading compromise package reached between the rapporteur, chairperson of the Environment Committee Caroline JACKSON (EPP-ED, South West), major political groups and the Council. LIFE III expires on 31 December 2004. There is a need to extend the existing instrument in order to ensure continuity until a new approach is developed in view of the new post-2006 financial perspective. The extension will cover 2 years and include certain modifications to the existing Regulation. The geographical scope of LIFE is not modified (EU and some countries on Mediterranean and Baltic Seas and in central and east European accession candidate countries). The participation of the Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus would be considered later. The compromise adopted says that the grant of assistance in respect of purchase of land shall be subject to the condition that the land is reserved in the long term for uses of land consistent with the objective of LIFE. Member States must ensure the long-term reservation of such land for nature conservation purposes. The compromise sets the budget to €317.2 million, which is the amount proposed by the Commission. However, the budgetary authority shall authorise annual appropriations within the limits of the applicable financial perspective.
