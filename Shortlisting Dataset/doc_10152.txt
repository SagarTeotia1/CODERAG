The Programme covers a period of four years from the 1st of January 2005. The programme is worth some €163 million. Parliament acknowledges the importance of the objectives of the eContent programme as set out but clarifies the objectives and in some cases limit the scope of the wording to for instance, areas of public interest, such as public sector information, learning content, scientific and scholarly content, and content from cultural institutions. As to the financial framework for the implementation for the period from 1st January 2005 to 31 December 2008, the House agrees with the Commission's figure of EUR 163 million, but sets out that EUR 55,6 million should be used for the period until 31 December 2006. Furthermore, MEPs underline that the eContent programme extends beyond the current financial perspective and want to guarantee sufficient funds for the programme beyond 2006.
