Question for written answer E-000425/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (23 January 2012) Subject: Deliberate exploitation of underage refugees by people-smugglers In developing countries people-smugglers deliberately recruit those wishing to leave the country and do not shrink from using force to make people sell their homes and cattle and migrate. They also use as an incitement the EUR 40 pocket money which refugees at the Austrian Traiskirchen camp used to receive monthly for items of daily use and usually sent home to their countries of origin, where EUR 40 is a lot of money and a reason for sending sons to Europe. Austria is now attempting to stop this snowball effect by issuing tokens instead of cash. Since children and adolescents receive preferential treatment, many refugees are made younger — at least on paper — by the smugglers by means of false papers. Determination of age using X-rays could put a stop to this abuse. However, the most recent trend is now to take children from Afghans who are stranded in Greek refugee camps and to put them outside the camp gate in Traiskirchen. The number of ‘unaccompanied minors’ has grown immensely in a very short time as a result. Asylum procedures are settled quickly in the case of children. The adults then follow the ‘anchor children’ — as they are called in technical jargon — in accordance with statutory family reunification. 1. What experiences have other Member States had regarding the snowball effect due to ‘pocket money’ for asylum‑seekers? 2. In which Member States is age already determined by X-rays and in which ones is this still planned? 3. What is the Commission’s position regarding this trend towards exploiting ‘anchor children’, which certainly does not correspond to the intention of asylum laws?
