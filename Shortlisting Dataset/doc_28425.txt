Question for written answer P-011290/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Gianluca Susta (S&D) (13 January 2011) Subject: Funding of local public transport in Italy With regard to Regulation (EEC) No 1191/1969 and Regulation (EEC) No 1370/2007 on action by Member States concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service in transport by rail, road and inland waterway, the Commission has repeatedly stated that since Italy has failed to take advantage of the opportunity to apply for exemptions from that legislation, any national laws that conflict with the Treaty and with the above EU regulations are to be considered null and void. Italy must therefore comply in full with the abovementioned regulations, including the provisions on compensation payments, which must be real and must cover in full the service provided. Can the Commission therefore say whether: — the road service contracts with exclusive rights that have been granted in recent years by the Province of Novara to operators providing services for the same transport links that are already being provided by rail operators are in breach of the above regulations; — such measures, which are actually a kind of dual cross-subsidisation using public funds for the benefit of operators providing two types of service — local public transport and alternative transport — are not to be deemed improper exclusive rights and state aid; — these measures may not, therefore, have caused economic damage to competitor companies, such as the Fontaneto bus company, and have distorted competition?
