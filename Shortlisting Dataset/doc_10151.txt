The Joint European Venture programme was created in 1998 as part of the multiannual programme for SMEs and aimed to stimulate the creation of transnational joint ventures between SMEs within the European Economic Area to help them to internationalise their activities and take full advantage of the Single Market. The joint venture had to be created between at least two SMEs from two different states. Parliament outlines that JEV has fallen short of its objectives. It is expensive, slow and complicated to administer, demand for it has been low and any substantial simplification aimed at improving both its attractiveness and its effectiveness would entail losing the entire unused committed budget of approximately €43 million. Moreover, the existing committed budget cannot be used for projects involving the candidate countries. MEPs therefore support the Commission's plan to phase out the programme as soon as possible on the grounds of poor cost-effectiveness and lack of demand. The JEV programme had gained the reputation of being slow, bureaucratic and very demanding since the creation of a joint venture company is often perceived to be the most difficult and costly form of transnational co-operation between SMEs. Programmes aimed at SMEs, says the Parliament, should seek to address efficiently market failures in the access of SMEs to risk capital through enhancing participation of both private and public actors. Lastly, the House also calls on the Commission to present an annual report to Parliament and Council on the implementation of the multiannual programme for SMEs as well as overall reports for 2005 and 2006 when the programme is due to end. Paul RÜBIG (EPP-ED, A) thanked the Commission and Council for enabling this decision to be reached in less than four months and in one single reading.
