the dialogue on Human Rights between the EU and the DPRK. It calls on the government of the DPRK to fulfil its obligations under human rights instruments to which it is a party and ensure that humanitarian organisations, independent human rights monitors, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief have free access to the country. MEPs welcome the agreement between the World Food Programme and the government of the DPRK to support 1.9 million of the most vulnerable people, especially women and young children. They deplore, however, the ongoing and unnecessary suffering of the North Korean people as a consequence of the government’s policies, stressing that there should always be targeted and fair distribution of food in the country. They urge the government of the DPRK to end discrimination in its distribution of food in favour of high-ranking Workers’ Party officials and military, intelligence and police officers. Parliament calls on the government of the DPRK to hand over finally and completely all information on the citizens of South Korea and Japan who were abducted during recent decades, and immediately to release those abductees still being held in its country. It also calls on the government of the People’s Republic of China to stop repatriating North Korean citizens to the DPRK, where, regardless of their reasons for leaving, they face harsh treatment, ranging from detention to torture, long prison terms and even executions. Finally, MEPs call on the Republic of Korea (ROK) to assume its responsibility for North Korean refugees in China and on the government of the ROK to allow them to travel to South Korea. 20060609IPR08847 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
