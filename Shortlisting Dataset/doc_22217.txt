Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (26 February 2010) The working processes of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are based on extensive consultation and advice by expert bodies. An efficient execution of those processes is essential to ensure the highest quality of the different kinds of documents produced by EASA. This is reflected in the European common rules for aviation safety Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the Parliament and of the Council of February 2008 on common rules in the filed of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC, OJ L 79, 19.3.2008. which provide for all opinions of the Agency addressed to the Commission in preparation of proposals for basic principles, applicability and essential requirements to be produced in all official languages of the Union. The possibility to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with all stakeholders concerned before such opinions are prepared is of high importance. Proposals presented for consultation purposes before the elaboration of Agency opinions are produced only in one of the working languages listed in Regulation No 1/1958 of the Council Council Regulation No 1 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community, OJ 17, 6.10.1958, p. 385, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006, OJ L 363, 20.12.2006. . It is, however, usual practice to inform in detail the various stakeholders at national level in cooperation with national authorities concerned. Such practice ensures that, on the one hand, the industry concerned is informed and can present its comments in its own language and that, on the other hand, the rulemaking process which as such includes a process of consultation is not unduly delayed for lack of translation.
