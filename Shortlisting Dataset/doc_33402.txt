Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (2 July 2010) The Commission has monitored the use of the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in all Member States of the European Union and of EFTA on a regular basis since its introduction and continues to do so. Each year the members of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security Systems are requested to reply to a questionnaire on the EHIC which contains a question on the number of EHICs issued. In 2009 the total number of EHICs in circulation was estimated at 188 million, which shows that more than one third of people in the European Union have an EHIC. That number is growing every year. The Eurobarometer survey on pensions and the EHIC carried out in September-October 2009 reports that 56 % of respondents throughout the EU are aware of the EHIC. The findings also show that the majority of respondents with an EHIC always carry it with them when travelling around the EU. The Commission considers the EHIC a success for people in the EU. It has received no complaint regarding the quality of the healthcare delivered to EHIC holders. However, certain difficulties relating to the recognition of cards and its acceptance are still reported. The Commission therefore continues to inform the public on the rights of holders and healthcare providers under the EHIC. One example is the information campaign on the EHIC which the Commission carried out from May to June 2009.
