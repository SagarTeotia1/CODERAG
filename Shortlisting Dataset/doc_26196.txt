WRITTEN QUESTION E-0271/08 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (28 January 2008) Subject: Islamic slaughter: Internet guide The Internet has come to the aid of Muslims who have no experience of slaughtering or live in countries where it is prohibited to kill animals outside slaughterhouses. The www.edba7.com website provides an online sacrifice service. All one needs to do is to click, select the size and type of animal and pay by credit card. The people running the website look after the rest, from the actual slaughter through to the meat distribution stage. 1. Does the Commission not consider that this is contrary to the laws of Member States and that the www.edba7.com website might also be used to carry out other acts of cruelty to other animals? 2. What action will it take?
