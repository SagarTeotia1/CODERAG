WRITTEN QUESTION E-2086/06 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Council (12 May 2006) Subject: Illegal logging of timber The illegal logging of and trade in timber currently taking place is one of the greatest threats to the world's forests. The main driving force behind this activity is the burgeoning worldwide demand for wood, paper and other forest products. The result is that enormous areas of forest are disappearing daily, adversely affecting biological diversity and human beings as a consequence. The EU is one of the biggest importers of timber in the world and is a large market for forest products. The Commission previously presented an action plan setting out possible measures to combat illegal logging and trade. On 27 April 2006, the WWF presented a report on EU governments’ measures to combat illegal logging. No Member State receives the approval of this survey and it is observed that, in general, there is a lack of effective and vigorous measures to combat illegal logging and trading. Is the Council prepared to take vigorous initiatives to put an end to illegal logging among Member States and applicant countries, and to act outside the EU to ensure that the devastation and illegal trading cease?
