Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (28 November 2008) The Commission is not aware of any allegations that pressure was put by the EU on Austria to extradite Mr Zagorec to Croatia. As regards organised crime and corruption in Croatia more generally, the Commission set out the current state of play in its Progress Report SEC(2008)2694 final. on Croatia published on 5 November 2008. In this report, the Commission concludes that corruption remains widespread in Croatia and organised crime a concern. Recent events, to which the Honourable Member refers in his question, have underlined the importance of tackling these issues as a matter of urgency. The Croatian authorities have taken a number of measures in response to the recent killings in Croatia. Specialised departments in selected courts are being established to tackle more efficiently organised crime cases prepared by the Office for the Fight Against Organised Crime and Corruption, a new police structure has been introduced and improvements in coordination between law enforcement authorities planned. The initial response goes in the right direction. However, now Croatia needs to establish a track record of results in properly investigating and effectively prosecuting cases of corruption and organised crime. The Commission will continue to monitor developments closely in Croatia as regards the fight against corruption and organised crime. These issues will also continue to receive particular attention in the context of the accession negotiations between the EU and Croatia.
