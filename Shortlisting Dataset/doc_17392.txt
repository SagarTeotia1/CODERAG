ORAL QUESTION H-0150/04 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Seán Ó Neachtain to the Commission Subject: Securing investment for the west of Ireland The Commission has recently stated that the Lisbon process is the best way to ensure that the EU is not buffeted by competition from low-cost countries in the east, such as India and China and Russia, and by the US in the west, and that the EU needs a plan to adapt to changing circumstances and to avoid being overtaken by its rivals. Given that the west of Ireland is the most peripheral location of the European Union, will the Commission indicate what action it is prepared to support to ensure that the west of Ireland can compete successfully to attract new and innovative investment and become a central player in the EU's internal market?
