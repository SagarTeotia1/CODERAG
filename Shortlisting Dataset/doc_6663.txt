Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (25 January 2008) On 16 November 2007 the Court of Cassation Chief Public Prosecutor filed a lawsuit against the DTP party at the Constitutional Court. The prosecutor made the case that DTP has become the focal point of activities against the integrity and unity of Turkey, and requested the dissolution of the party and a five-year political ban for 221 party executives. On 23 November 2007 the Constitutional Court accepted to examine the case. The party will have to prepare its defence within one month. Prominent members of the government, including Prime Minister Erdoğan, publicly disapproved of the closure case. Likewise, members of other political parties and the press criticised the lawsuit. Political pluralism is one of the most important features of modern democracy. Further to the 11 July 2007 Parliamentary elections, the Turkish parliament is now largely representative of the country's political diversity. Pluralism has increased, and the quality of Turkish democracy has improved. The Commission has consistently welcomed this, including in its 6 November 2007 Progress report SEC(2007)1436. . It is from this perspective that the Commission will monitor closely all developments related to the DTP closure case.
