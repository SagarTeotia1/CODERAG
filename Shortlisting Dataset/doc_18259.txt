WRITTEN QUESTION E-4480/05 by Mario Mauro (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (1 December 2005) Subject: Chinese laogai The European Commission will surely be aware of the controversial issue recently reported in the press of the laogai, or so-called ‘re-education’ camps, that were set up in China by Mao Tse-Tung and still operate today. Serious violations of the human rights of laogai inmates have been reported, relating in particular to the lack of procedural protection, torture, forced labour in often dangerous conditions and removal of the bodily organs of prisoners sentenced to death. The exact number of laogai is unknown, since this is considered a state secret, but it is estimated that they currently house between 4 and 6 million inmates. What action will the Commission take to press the Chinese Government to safeguard human rights?
