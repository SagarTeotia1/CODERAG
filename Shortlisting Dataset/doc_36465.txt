crisis. Studies show that the rules are expected to lead to banks having to hold three to four times more capital against their trading risk than they do at present. Next steps Following the plenary vote, Council will now rubber-stamp the deal, possibly on 13 July. The rules on bonus provisions will then take effect in January 2011 and those on capital requirements provisions no later than 31 December 2011. Pay principles for all listed companies Separately, in a non-legislative resolution drafted by Saïd El Khadraoui (S&D, BE), Parliament calls for remuneration policy principles to be extended to cover all companies listed on stock exchanges. It proposes that listed companies be required to explain their remuneration policies if their directors' pay is deemed not to follow certain principles aimed at removing incentives to take excessive risk or to take decisions based on short-term considerations. The resolution also proposes that shareholders be given greater control over the directors of a listed company. Finally, 'golden parachutes' handed to directors in cases of early termination should be limited to the equivalent of two years of the fixed component of the director's pay and severance pay should be banned in cases of non-performance or early departure, says the resolution, which was adopted by 594 votes to 24 with 35 abstentions. 20100706IPR77907 Report on remuneration of directors of listed companies and remuneration policies in the financial services sector Report as regarding capital requirements for the trading book and for re-securitisations, and the supervisory review of remuneration policies FAQ on the Capital Requirements and Bonuses package Adopted text will be available here (click on 7 July) Profile of rapporteur Arlene McCarthy (S&D, UK) Profile of rapporteur Saïd El Khadraoui (S&D, BE) EN 4 LINK /activities/plenary/ta/calendar.do?language=EN EN 5 LINK /members/public/yourMep/view.do?name=McCarthy&partNumber=1&language=EN&id=2173 EN 6 LINK /members/public/yourMep/view.do?name=El+Khadraoui&partNumber=1&language=EN&id=25718 -//EP//TEXT REPORT A7-2010-0208 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT REPORT A7-2010-0205 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20100702BKG77709 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
