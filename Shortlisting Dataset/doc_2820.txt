WRITTEN QUESTION E-1847/07 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (10 April 2007) Subject: Habitual residence condition in Ireland In 2006, following an investigation, the Commission concluded that the practical application of habitual residence condition by the Irish authorities was compatible with the relevant Community provisions (e.g. Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 OJ L 149, 5.7.1971, p. 2 . ). Groups working with immigrants in Ireland such as Emigrant Advice and the Homeless Agency now point out that EEA workers are being refused supplementary welfare assistance by the Irish authorities as the work they are involved in is not being classified as adequate by the relevant Irish welfare authorities. Furthermore, they highlight a lack of knowledge among Irish officials about the exact welfare entitlements of such workers. In the light of the information now being highlighted by Emigrant Advice and the Homeless Agency, will the Commission re-examine the practical application of the habitual residency condition?
