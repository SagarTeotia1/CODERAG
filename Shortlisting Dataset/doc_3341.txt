Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (28 November 2011) The annual air quality report from Spain for the year 2010 is known to the Commission and is accessible to the public via the central data repository of the European Environment Agency http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/es/eu/annualair/coltowtyw . Spain has to date not notified an extension of the deadline to apply the NO 2 limit values in accordance with Directive 2008/50/EC OJ L 152, 11.6.2008. for the city of Madrid. The Commission had asked Member States to file such requests by the end of September 2011. It has however been indicated to the Commission that the Spanish authorities still intend to notify additional zones and agglomerations for such an extension. Where Member States comply with the conditions to request a time extension for NO 2 , the Commission recommends that they still file such a request. Where Member States are in breach of EU air quality standards it is within the Commission's prerogative to initiate an infringement procedure which can result in an action before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
