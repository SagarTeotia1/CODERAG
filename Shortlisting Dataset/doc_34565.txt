WRITTEN QUESTION E-4526/05 by Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven (Verts/ALE) to the Council (5 December 2005) Subject: Transparency of Bulgarian National Assembly There is a great difference in the levels of transparency and the quality of the website between the European Parliament (http://www.europarl.eu.int) and the website of the Bulgarian National Assembly (http://www.parliament.bg). The European Parliament publishes the texts of all parliamentary questions and the answers; texts of all plenary speeches; the minutes of all the plenary debates; all officially adopted texts e.g. reports, motions for resolutions, tabled amendments, agendas of future meetings of each parliamentary committee and agendas of the upcoming plenary sessions. Also, there is a web-based public register of the EP's documents. In other words, the manner in which the website of the European Parliament is set up makes the Parliament's policies transparent to EU citizens. The Bulgarian National Assembly does not follow similar standards of transparency. All the abovementioned agendas and texts are not published on its website. This includes draft legislation, motions for resolutions, tabled amendments, etc. Moreover, there is no public access to a web-based public register of the documents of the Assembly. To be relevant to the Copenhagen criteria, Bulgaria's young democracy has to be strengthened through greater transparency of the Bulgarian National Assembly. The website of the Assembly has to provide the same level of transparency to Bulgarian citizens as the website of the EP provides for EU citizens. What action will the Council take to encourage Bulgaria to bring the website of the National Assembly up to European standards, thereby increasing transparency of government policy?
