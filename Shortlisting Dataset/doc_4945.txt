9999/C Q999 E/014 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0521/04 by Anna Karamanou (PSE) to the Council (11 February 2004) Subject: Illegal transplantation of children's organs in Albania intended for patients in EU countries Reports have appeared in the Albanian press citing official Italian sources and stating that at a clinic in the Albanian town of Fieri children's organs are being removed and transferred for transplantation in Italy and France. According to the same Albanian press report, Italian and Albanian doctors are involved in this practice. The doctors contact Albanian networks which find the children and they remove the organs for transplantation for a fee paid to the children's parents. Finally, it is reported that 39 Albanian children have gone missing without trace, and that no one - not even their families - have searched for them. What actions does the Council intend to take to improve the implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Albanian state in respect of organised crime? Will it say what steps Europol has taken to eradicate this phenomenon on the basis of the plan for cooperation with the national authorities of southeastern Europe to eliminated organised crime?
