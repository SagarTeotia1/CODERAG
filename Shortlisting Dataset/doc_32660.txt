WRITTEN QUESTION P-0844/09 by Christel Schaldemose (PSE) to the Commission (10 February 2009) Subject: Application of the precautionary principle to hazardous chemicals On 30 January 2009 Danish Radio described a new American study carried out by Jørn Olsen, a Danish professor at UCLA. The study shows that a number of chemical substances are harmful to women wishing to become pregnant. These harmful substances are the perfluorinated chemicals, which are hard to avoid since they are used in many common household products. Every day researchers are finding evidence that chemicals which are harmful to the reproductive system or to genetic material, or increase the risk of cancer. And although the EU has adopted the use of the precautionary principle towards chemicals, it unfortunately all too often happens that studies on the substances under suspicion are unduly delayed. This is not in the consumer's interest, and we risk compromising citizens’ health and safety. In its communication of February 2000, COM(2000)0001, the Commission goes into detail on the cases in which the precautionary principle may be applied. It states that the principle covers ‘those specific circumstances where scientific evidence is insufficient, inconclusive or uncertain and there are indications through preliminary objective scientific evaluation that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the chosen level of protection’. Does the Commission consider that it acted in accordance with its own recommendation in connection with, for example, azo dyes, bisphenol A and, most recently, Teflon? Can the Commission state to what extent the precautionary principle underlies its work, and does it propose to step up the use of the precautionary principle in the light of the many studies casting suspicion on chemical substances?
