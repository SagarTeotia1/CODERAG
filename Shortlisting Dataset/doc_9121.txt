Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2004) There is no EU Regulation granting EU citizens in receipt of social security benefit an exemption from civil court fees. In January 2003, the Council adopted Directive 2002/8/EC of 27 January 2003, to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid for such disputes OJ L 26, 31.1.2003 . . However, this Directive does not as such provide that EU citizens in receipt of social security benefits will be exempted systematically from the payment of court fees. The Directive is to be transposed as to the bulk of its provisions not later than 30 November 2004. The provisions of this Directive apply to ‘cross-border’ civil cases, i.e. where the person requesting legal aid does not live in the Member State where the case will be heard or where the decision is to be enforced. The Directive establishes the principle that persons who do not have sufficient resources to secure or defend their rights in law are entitled to receive appropriate legal aid. To this end, it specifies the conditions relating to the applicant’s financial resources which may be applied by Member States when awarding legal aid. Member States are free to define the threshold above which a person would be presumed able to bear the costs of proceedings. Finally, legal aid is to be granted or refused by the competent authority of the Member State in which the court is sitting.
