WRITTEN QUESTION E-0336/10 by Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) to the Commission (8 February 2010) Subject: Security of mobile phone calls It has recently been reported that the conversations of mobile phone consumers/users are not sufficiently protected. At the Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin it was announced that a German IT expert had managed to crack the basic encryption algorithm which prevents the interception of overwhelming majority of mobile phone calls. This basic encryption algorithm was designed in 1988 to prevent mobile phone interception and is now used to protect 80 % of calls worldwide. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Does the EU intend to take additional measures to ensure the confidentiality of calls so as to protect European consumers? If so, which measures? 2. Is there any provision for toucher legislation in the light of new technological developments, and which guidelines does it intend to issue to the relevant bodies in Member States so as to ensure greater protection of phone conversations at EU level?
