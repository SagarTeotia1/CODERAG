WRITTEN QUESTION E-5345/07 by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (29 October 2007) Subject: Asian immigrants on the coasts of Africa Is the Commission aware that, according to reliable sources, between four and five thousand illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan are currently to be found on beaches in Guinea, waiting for a ship to take them to the Canary Islands? Without revealing data which might undermine any Frontex operations, will the Commission confirm this matter and say whether any action has been taken in order to prevent the immigrants in question from setting sail?
