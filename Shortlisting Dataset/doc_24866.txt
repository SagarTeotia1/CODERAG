Answer given by Mrs Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (19 August 2010) The Commission has been following the food crisis in West Africa very closely stepping up its emergency assistance as the crises worsened especially in the Sahel countries. Once it became clear in September 2009 that the erratic rains would lead to a poor harvest, the European Commission allocated EUR 10 million from the 2009 humanitarian aid budget to support actions by NGO, Red Cross and UN partners to mitigate the impact of the food and nutrition crisis that would happen in 2010. A further EUR 20 million was allocated in early 2010 towards action in response to the food crisis and to continue to support activities in the fight against malnutrition in the Sahel region of West Africa. As the crisis worsened during the current lean period from April 2010 onwards, another EUR 24 million was allocated in June 2010 bringing the total humanitarian aid commitment to the Sahel to EUR 54 million. Both OXFAM and Save the Children have benefitted from funding from these Commission decisions. The Commission is currently working with all its partners in the Sahel to update the needs assessments and to coordinate with other donors to ensure that an adequate donor response continues to be made to the overall needs. Apart from the humanitarian aid budget, the Commission has also mobilised considerable funding commitments from the European Development Fund (EDF) and from the Food Facility in action to mitigate the impact of the food crisis. In this context, so far, EUR 29.2 million has already been allocated to Niger in 2009 and 2010 from EDF and Food Facility sources and a further EUR 19.1 million has been allocated in Chad in 2009 and 2010. The need to allocate further resources in response to the crisis is under constant examination.
