that it is absolutely essential to maintain territorial differentiation in competition policy in order to pursue a territorial cohesion objective. While generally satisfied with the Third Report, MEPs oppose the current practice whereby Parliament only gives its opinion on this strategic document. It therefore asks for Parliament to rank equally with the Council for the purpose of adopting the Commission's cohesion programme.

MEPs accepted Article 100 as the best - and indeed the only possible - legal basis for the proposal, given that both Parliament and Council are opposed to the harmonisation measures originally proposed by the Commission, which were the only reason for using Article 95 of the Treaty (co-decision for single market legislation). When it originally considered the measures in September 2003, Parliament deleted clauses providing for major harmonisation of the gas supply industry at Community level. MEPs argued that the Commission was encroaching too far on the responsibilities of the Member States and companies, and described as "over-prescriptive" certain provisions at Community level. These included the establishment of quantifiable standards at EU level, the right for the Commission to infringe on contractual freedom of companies and a "crisis mechanism" at EU level that disregarded the hierarchy of responsibilities
