Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (29 July 2005) The Commission is fully aware of the need for measures to increase awareness of consumer rights deriving from Community legislation and to promote consumer associations as a source of information and advice amongst citizens of new Member States. It has therefore allocated a budget of EUR 1.6 million for such campaigns in its 2005 work programme. The call for tender for such campaigns foreseen for 2005 has not yet been launched because the Commission has been reviewing the set-up of these campaigns in the light of the experience with the campaign’s implementation in Poland. A call for tender will definitely be launched this summer for awareness-raising campaigns in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia. The arrangements for this tender are currently being developed so as to avoid certain implementation problems encountered in Poland. It is planned that the work programme for 2006, to be adopted by the Commission by 31 January 2006, will include further budget allocations for similar campaigns in remaining Member States, as will the work programme for 2007. The intention is that campaigns will be launched in the six remaining new Member States in 2006 and 2007.
