development cooperation is insufficient and urges the Commission and Member States to take action, with the emphasis on amending laws, institutions and existing patriarchal patterns, increasing budgetary resources and improving social and economic conditions for women. European envoy for Women's Rights Parliament calls on the Council to appoint a European Envoy for Women's Rights who would strengthen the EU`s commitment to the empowerment of women in foreign and development policy, and who would promote the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by focusing on equality between men and women worldwide, on reducing maternal mortality and on fighting poverty. Women's role in post-war societies, violence against women Turning to specific problems, the report calls for better understanding of the role of women in post-war societies and of their contributions to post-war reconstruction. Regarding violence against women, it acknowledges the Commission’s efforts to raise awareness of the issue but urges that more attention be paid to "trafficking in human beings, torture and harmful traditional practices, with an emphasis on female genital mutilation, honour crimes and early and forced marriage". It also calls for more female personnel in institutions that directly assist victims of these practices. Sexual issues, reproductive and health rights The express link between women and HIV (in terms of increasing the rate of infection) spelt out in the Commission's paper is welcomed by the committee, but MEPs believe Member States should be pressed to meet the financial commitments they have given on this matter. The report states that "empowering women by ensuring full access to sexual and reproductive health information, services and supplies puts them in a better position to negotiate safe sex and protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)". It backs the Commission's proposals for protecting women from STDs, including funding for developing microbiocides and vaccines and measures on reproductive health and rights. Status of women under Sharia law Lastly, the report "deplores in the strongest possible terms the virtual chattel status of women trapped under Sharia Law, and regards this oppression as representing the diametric opposite of every principle this Report holds to be of paramount importance".

It will develop new information and communication technology (ICT), to enable more elderly people to access public services more easily, but these services must nonetheless respect their privacy and dignity, say MEPs. Parliament approved a first-reading deal with Council on the programme with 431 votes in favour, 10 votes against and 8 abstentions. Speaking in the debate in Strasbourg, rapporteur Neena Gill
