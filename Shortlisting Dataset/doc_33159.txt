ORAL QUESTION O-0012/02 pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure by Giuseppe Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to the Commission Subject: Tobacco products: smuggling Can the Commission indicate what problems have arisen in Member States with the implementation of Directive 92/12/EEC with regard to tobacco products acquired by private individuals for their own use? In the light of any problems which have arisen, does the Commission propose to amend the Directive in order to facilitate application of the provision on guide levels for the importation of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages for travellers' own use and what efforts, if any, does the Commission envisage undertaking in order to reduce the disparities between the levels of excise duty charged in the Member States? In so far as the Commission has issued letters before action or made any other approach to any Member States, can it specify: on what basis and on what evidence any letter before action was issued; what reaction has any such letter had from the competent national authorities; what meetings has the competent Commissioner had with those authorities; whether he has received offers from the competent national authorities to see for himself the problems Member States face and whether he has taken up those offers; if not, why not; whether, in the light of the response from the competent national authorities, the Commission intends to proceed further, for instance by issuing a reasoned opinion and, if so, when; given the substantial smuggling problem within the internal market, what constructive proposals, if any, it has made to competent authorities to enable them to allow citizens to enjoy the benefits of the internal market, including unhampered free movement within the European Union, yet permit their customs authorities to combat unlawful smuggling operations in a proportionate manner?
