the deal could be deferred for a further two months should the Commission find incompatibilities. During these two further months, the Commission would have to issue a legal opinion. Infringement procedures The Commission's original proposal was unclear as to what would be done in cases where proposed deals are found to be incompatible with EU law. The Energy Committee, at the insistence of Mr Kariņš (EPP, LV), therefore added a clear two-step procedure for such cases, whereby the Commission would first issue legal opinions and recommendations, and then, should the EU countries concerned fail to act on them, the Commission would consider launching infringement proceedings. Confidentiality MEPs also added extra safeguard clauses to protect all parties involved. The Commission would share information received with all Member States in a "secure" electronic form, but only those parts which are not indicated by the EU country concerned as being confidential. The Commission would also need to report to Parliament every two years on all new energy deals. This vote provides a mandate to start negotiations with a view to a possible first-reading agreement.
