2002/C 205 E/187 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0619/02 by María Sornosa Martínez (PSE) to the Commission (6 March 2002) Subject: Incompatibility of the Spanish government's nuclear power policy with the Kyoto agreements The Spanish government, which currently occupies the EU presidency, has now approved an environmental impact assessment concerning the creation of 22 new nuclear power stations within its territory. In addition, the construction of another 49 such stations has been announced, entailing an extra 31 000 to 36 000 megawatts of power and additional emissions of 108 to 125 million tonnes of CO 2 per annum. In this connection, particular attention needs to be drawn to the case, as denounced by Greenpeace, of the planned extension of the Endesa power station in Carboneras (Almería province), which, if it goes ahead, would raise its power level as high as 1 859 to 1 959 megawatts and make it Spain's biggest producer of CO 2 emissions, to a maximum exceeding 14 million tonnes per annum. Does the Commission consider these plans for extending and constructing nuclear power stations to be consistent and compatible with the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and its targets for reducing CO 2 emissions? Will the Commission make representations to the Spanish government, the current occupant of the EU's six-month presidency, to ask it to reconsider its existing policy on nuclear power stations and bring it into line with the targets of the Protocol?
