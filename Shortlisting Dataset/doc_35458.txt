Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (5 November 2007) The Commission remains concerned regarding the crackdowns on unregistered churches by the Chinese authorities and the situation of Chinese Christians deprived of their basic rights to freely express their belief. Freedom of religion belief has been constantly very high on the agenda of the EU‑China bilateral Dialogue on Human Rights. The Commission indeed considers this issue as an important element of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the early ratification of which is seen as a priority by the EU. The EU raised again all matters related to freedom of religion at the bilateral Human Rights Dialogue, which took place in Beijing on 17 and 18 October 2007. The Commission is deeply committed to continue pressing the Chinese authorities to allow individuals in China to be guaranteed the right to practice their religion without any restriction.
