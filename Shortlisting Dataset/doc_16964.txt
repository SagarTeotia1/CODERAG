Question for written answer E-5352/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (13 July 2010) Subject: Flying with musical instruments Could the Commission please clarify whether there is a standard practice in the European Union for musicians wishing to fly with musical instruments? If, as I suspect, there is no EU‑wide policy for dealing with instruments being brought on planes as carrier luggage or through airport security, what measures will the Commission take in order to clarify the regulations and afford continuity to airport security with specific regard to musical instruments?
