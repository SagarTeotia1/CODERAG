Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2010) At the outset, it should be noted that the gross annual adjustment proposed in 2009 (3.7 %) would have resulted in a net impact of 2.3 % as of 1 January 2010, taking into account inflation for international staff in Brussels and increases in the pension contribution rate and the special levy. As the Honourable Members are aware, the Council decided to apply a gross annual adjustment of only 1.85 % Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1296/2009 of 23 December 2009 adjusting with effect from 1 July 2009 the remuneration and pensions of officials and other servants of the European Union and the correction coefficients applied thereto, OJ L 348, 29.12.2009, p. 10. . The Commission has lodged an action for annulment against the Council, because it takes the view that the regulation enacted by the latter is not in compliance with the method of annual adjustment provided for in Article 65 of the Staff Regulations See Annex to Regulation No 31 (EEC), 11 (EAEC), laying down the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, OJ P 45, 14.6.1962, p. 1385, as amended. and in Annex XI thereto. As to the questions in detail: 1. The range of Member States used for calculation of the annual adjustment was determined by the Council in 2004. The eight selected Member States (Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Great Britain and the Netherlands) represent over 75 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the EU. For the purposes of the method for the annual adjustment after the enlargement in 2004 the Council excluded the new Member States since these were expected to be in a rapidly increasing ‘catch up’ phase which would have unduly benefited EU officials. Until 2008 this was the case and salaries in EU27 grew faster than in the eight Member States used for the method. Had the other Member States been included, the evolution of salaries for EU officials and other servants would have been more favourable by 2.8 % for the period 2004‑08. 2. The method for the annual adjustment links the evolution of salaries of EU officials and other servants to the evolution of purchasing power of civil servants in a sample of Member States, as described above. As a result, the evolution of civil servant salaries at EU level is neither better nor worse than it was in those Member States, on a weighted average, during the twelve months leading up to the effective date of the annual adjustment. The figures for July 2008 to July 2009 have shown an increase in purchasing power for the eight sample Member States. The proposed amount of the annual adjustment is therefore the consequence of salary policies in those Member States. If the crisis leads these Member States to apply lower increases or even reductions, the impact of the crisis will be reflected in the next annual adjustment (an adjustment can
