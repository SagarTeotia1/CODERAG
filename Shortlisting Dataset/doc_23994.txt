2004/C 78 E/247 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3260/03 by Michel Hansenne (PPE-DE) to the Commission (4 November 2003) Subject: Approving the setting up of a driving school The royal decree adopted by Belgium on 23 March 1998 sets out the arrangements for approving the opening of a driving school in Belgium. It would seem that, in practice, this decree prevents the setting up of any new driving school. By taking this step, is Belgium not in breach of EU law, particularly competition law? If so, what does Belgium have to do to conform with EU rules?
