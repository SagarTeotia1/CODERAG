Question for written answer E-7739/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (29 September 2010) Subject: Hourly labour costs in Greece and in the rest of the EU The economic crisis and the financial measures taken in many Member States are having a significant impact on labour costs in the Member States and on their overall competitiveness. Does the Commission have any recent data on hourly labour costs in Greece and in the remaining EU Member States? How do these figures differ from previous years? Does the Commission have any precise data on variations in hourly labour costs in the various sectors in Greece (industry, construction, etc.)? In the context of the memorandum of understanding between Greece, the IMF, the ECB and the EU, is the Commission anticipating a further drop in hourly labour costs in Greece resulting from the adoption of further measures over and above those already taken?
