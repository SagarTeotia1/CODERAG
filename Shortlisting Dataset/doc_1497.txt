Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (29 November 2010) The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that it does not dispose of any information regarding the question's items 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. The Commission suggests that the Honourable Member might take up contact directly with the College of Europe and the European University Institute for further information. With respect to the question's item 4, the Commission confirms the amount mentioned in answer to the Honourable Member's Question E‑5547/10 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . The European University Institute (EUI) received from the European Union budget in 2010 an amount of EUR 7 860 000 as operating grant and an amount of EUR 1 947 450 for the Historical EU Archives. With respect to the question's item 7, the Commission does not seek the advice of the EUI in its decision-making on policy issues and the development of the European Union. However, since the expertise of the EUI covers a large area of the European Union's policies, academic staff members of the EUI have, for example, been called upon to serve as speakers on the occasion of Jean Monnet Conferences dealing with current topics of European affairs.
