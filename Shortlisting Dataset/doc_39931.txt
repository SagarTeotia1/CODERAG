ORAL QUESTION H-0573/02 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Robert Evans to the Commission Subject: Near extinction of the Iberian lynx Does the Commission believe that its environmental impact assessments undertaken before the commencement of funded building projects take into account every possible impact on the environment, including the impact on flora, fauna, pollution, nature conservation, food chains, biodiversity and the ecological balance of an area? In particular, can the Commission explain why the Iberian lynx is facing extinction in Portugal and Spain following several EU-funded building projects there which have contributed heavily to the near-extinction of the species? Does the Commission have any plans to investigate this problem further or to help rectify the situation? How does the Commission propose to improve its Environmental Impact Assessments in order to ensure that such unwanted consequences do not result from EU projects in future?
