Union Solidarity Fund — Member States 3.2 p.m. p.m. 11.785.377 11.785.377 11.785.377 11.785.377 Total Section III - Commission 22.417.259.853 9.588.000.000 11.785.377 22.429.045.230 9.588.000.000 Romania applied for assistance of Fund following the floods that affected the country in July 2008. The application relates to five countries (Maramures, Suceava, Botosani, Iasi and Neamt) in the north-eastern part of Romania, affected by heavy rain, leading to sever flooding and landscapes, affecting the major part of the population living in this area. The Romanian authorities indicated that 214 municipalities with a total population of 1,6 of 3 million inhabitants suffered directly from the disaster. The Romanian authorities estimated the total direct damage at EUR 471,4 million which represents 83% of the normal threshold for mobilising the Fund applicable to Romania of EUR 566,8 million (i.e. 0,6% of Romania's GNI). As the quantitative criteria for a "major natural disaster" laid down in the Article 2 (1) of the Regulation N° 2012/2002 establishing the EUSF are not fulfilled, the proposal is based on so-called "extraordinary (regional) disaster" criterion, Article 2 (2) of the final subparagraph of the legal base. In accordance with which a region affected by an extraordinary disaster, mainly natural one, affecting the major part of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and the economic stability of the region could also benefit from assistance from the Fund. The Rapporteur welcomes that the Commission has proposed the mobilisation of the EUSF as a sole issue in the PDAB 1/2009, in accordance with the European Parliament and Council joint declaration of 17 July 2008, stating that the budgetary authority "(…) welcome the Commission commitment according to which, as from now, every preliminary draft amending budget required by the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund will be solely for that purpose." According to point 26 of the IIA, a trialogue should be held before the two arms of the budgetary authority give their agreement to the mobilisation. Due to the urgency the amending budget 1/2009 both arms of the budgetary authority agreed on a simplified procedure. On 24 February, the Committee on Budgets organised a hearing with the relevant Romanian local and regional authorities to assess the consequences of the floods and the effects of the mobilisation of EU Solidarity Fund. The Committee on Regional Development expressed its positive opinion in a letter attached to this report. The Rapporteur recommends the approval of the Commission proposal for a decision annexed to this report.
