Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (17 August 2010) 1. A citizen who decides to be treated abroad will most likely choose a Member State and a healthcare provider where he/she can be treated without delay. Therefore, the risk of creating or aggravating waiting lists because health systems have to provide care not only to their own citizens but also to other Member States' nationals seems to be limited. Should such situation nevertheless occur, patients from other Member States should not be discriminated against. Restricting their access to treatment would need to be justified by overriding reasons of general interest, and any such measures would need to be limited to what is necessary and proportionate. As far as organ transplants are concerned, the text agreed in Council in June 2010 states that the directive shall not apply to allocation and access to organs for the purpose of organ transplants. 2. According to Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the coordination of social security systems, OJ L 166, 30.4.2004. , on social security coordination, in the case of undue delay in providing healthcare, patients cannot be refused an authorisation to receive treatment in another Member State. The proposed directive does not intend to duplicate the existing Regulation. Its purpose is to clarify patients' rights in relation to cross border healthcare and in particular rights to reimbursement, when patients choose to travel to another Member State for the purpose of receiving healthcare. According to the proposed Directive, in principle, whenever a patient asks for prior authorisation and the conditions set by the regulation are met, the person shall receive prior authorisation under the conditions of the regulation.
