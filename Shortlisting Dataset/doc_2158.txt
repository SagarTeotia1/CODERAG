Question for written answer P-002838/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Hermann Winkler (PPE) (13 March 2012) Subject: Commission proposal COM(2011) 0615 for a Framework Cohesion Policy Regulation, Articles 82 and 84; calculation for transition regions based on new Eurostat figures The definition of the proposed ‘transition regions’ in Article 82(2)(b) of the framework Regulation COM(2011) 0615 reads: ‘transition regions, whose GDP per capita is BETWEEN 75 % and 90 % of the average GDP of the EU‑27’. According to Article 82(2)(c), more developed regions have a GDP per capita ABOVE 90 %. 1. To which of the above categories does the Commission assign regions with a GDP per capita of 90.0 %? My question comes in the wake of the Eurostat figures published recently on regional GDP per capita in the EU 2007-2009. The value for the NUTS 2 region of Leipzig in Germany was put at 90.0 %. The Commission proposal states that EU figures for 2006 to 2008 have been used as the basis for calculation. However, Commissioner Hahn has already emphasised on several occasions that the latest figures would be used. These will be available when the Council adopts a decision on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. However, it is important to give the regions legal security as quickly as possible. We need to know what basis for calculation is being used by the Commission. If we assume that the figures published today are the latest figures, then the interpretation of the 90.0 % value is crucial to the question of whether or not Leipzig, a phasing-out region, qualifies as a ‘transition region’. 2. Does the Commission assume that the figures published today will be the figures used as a basis for decision-making? 3. Am I right in understanding the Commission proposal to mean that the safety net, by which I mean the question of whether or not the regions receive at least two-thirds of the resources allocated to them for 2007-2013 under Article 84(2) of the framework Regulation, exists INDEPENDENTLY of whether or not the region qualifies as a ‘transition region’?
