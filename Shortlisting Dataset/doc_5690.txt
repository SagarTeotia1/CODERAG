Joint answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-5355/09 , E-5356/09 (30 November 2009) The Commission is aware of the mentioned case of arrest and detention of seven Sahrawi human rights defenders in Morocco and follows very closely this case through its Delegation in Rabat. Following information available to the Commission, the seven defenders have been charged by the general military prosecution in Rabat on 22 October 2009 among others of threatening territorial integrity. In the framework of the project financed by the Commission under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Moroccan Organisation for Human Rights will do the observation of the trial. The Commission is also aware of the case of Sultana Khaya, who was arrested and prevented from leaving the country. The Commission would like to reiterate that compliance with human rights principles is indeed a central element of EU‑Morocco relations, including in the framework of the ‘advanced status’, and is permanently among the subjects discussed in the political dialogue with that country. Furthermore, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member of the fact that the Community finances the protection of the human rights defenders in the Mediterranean region through an important grant to the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation of Support to Human Rights Defenders. The Commission is also following very closely developments on the issue of Western Sahara and, in particular, the negotiations undertaken under the auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations in order to find an acceptable political solution to the conflict. In this regard, the Commission supports the efforts of the Secretary General to mediate between the parties in compliance with the Security Council Resolution 1871(2009). The Commission provides humanitarian aid to the population of the camps in the Tindouf’s region for an amount of around EUR 10 million every year.
