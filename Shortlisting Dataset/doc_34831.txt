Conclusion The setting of the maximum amounts of the Community contribution per country is consistent with the approach adopted for the original regulation for which the amendment is proposed. the setting of the overall financial framework is not. Whilst it is indeed standard practice to set the overall financial framework for expenditure programmed on a multi-annual basis in the legislative act during the co-decision procedure, there is no justification for doing so beyond the period of the current financial perspective. The rapporteur considers that it would be premature to anticipate the expenditure to be programmed for the period 2007 - 2009 and that the amounts should therefore be deleted. Furthermore, the rapporteur considers that since the first amendment proposed by the Commission is merely a technical adaptation of a legal act, its correct legal basis is Article 57 (2) of the Act of Accession. The legal basis for the second amendment is nonetheless clearly Article 285 on the Treaty, hence the rapporteur's proposal that the proposal be presented as having a dual legal basis.
