Question for written answer E-002591/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Lorenzo Fontana (EFD) (17 March 2011) Subject: Import from China of products that are potentially harmful to health A few weeks ago, in Padova (Veneto, Italy), the Guardia di Finanza police seized 38 000 carcinogenic taps that had been made in China. Tests identified lead, chromium and nickel values that were severely toxic to humans. During the same investigation, another 50 000 items bearing a counterfeit CE mark were found. In the same week, in the port of Brindisi, 26 000 pairs of glasses for the correction of ‘simple presbyopia’ and other counterfeit material were seized. These glasses would have caused serious harm to consumers because of the lack of required quality standards and, in particular, the non-alignment of the focal axis. These are just some examples among many. According to the latest report by the Commission, 64 % of all counterfeit goods come from China. That said, 1. does the Commission not agree that, given the alarming increase in counterfeit goods that are harmful to the health of EU citizens, it needs to adopt more stringent measures in trade agreements with China? 2. Is the Commission carrying out any information campaigns to ensure that citizens are aware of the risks associated with buying counterfeit goods, and if so what kind of campaigns?
