WRITTEN QUESTION E-2359/07 by Åsa Westlund (PSE) to the Commission (2 May 2007) Subject: Climate impact of snow scooters Snow scooters are very popular in the northern parts of Finland and Sweden, as vehicles for both work and leisure. A study has now shown that, during the six months of winter, snow scooters account for 5 % of carbon dioxide emissions in the county of Västerbotten in Sweden. A snow scooter can emit up to 1 180 g of carbon dioxide per kilometre. Does the Commission intend to explore the possibilities of reducing the climate impact of snow scooters as planned for cars and light goods vehicles?
