same criteria to all the Member States concerned. It has always treated the problem of under-recording of Baltic cod catches as a general issue concerning all Member States bordering the Baltic Sea. Indeed Commission inspections established that the problem exists in all Member States. Nevertheless, by conducting uniform assessments of the issue, the level of misreporting of catches varied considerably between Member States. Based on the findings of earlier years, a series of Commission inspections were conducted in four of the Member States of the Baltic Sea region in 2007; that is, four in Poland, three in Sweden, one in Denmark and one in Germany. In the framework of the inspection missions it was again confirmed by Commission inspectors that under recording of catches continued to be a major problem with respect to Poland and to a much lesser extent in Sweden. The Commission estimated in particular that the Polish quota for cod in ICES subdivisions 25‑32 (eastern Baltic) had been substantially over-fished. Consequently, in line with its competences under the common fisheries policy the Commission closed the fishery for eastern Baltic cod for Poland on 9 July 2007 (Regulation 804/2007). In addition, further to contacts and ongoing monitoring by the Commission of the cod fisheries in Germany and Sweden, both these member states have closed their fisheries.
