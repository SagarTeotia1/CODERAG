WRITTEN QUESTION E-0948/07 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (26 February 2007) Subject: Simplification of rules on state aid The Commission recently decided to increase from EUR 100 000 to 200 000 the amount of subsidies that governments may pay to enterprises without prior EU authorisation. Given the Commission's firm view that the rules on state aid should be simplified in order to assist small businesses, particularly in disadvantaged regions, will it answer the following questions? 1. Are the Commission's departments drawing up a comprehensive proposal to revise the current regulation on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to de minimis aid? 2. Does the Commission intend to resolve by way of legislation issues which have arisen in connection with the application of the de minimis rule, inter alia the question of determining the recipient of the aid in relation to the correct application of the rules on cumulation (see ECJ C‑382/99, 13 June 2002), the problem of recovering aid exceeding the threshold of EUR 200 000 under schemes which do not make express reference to the de minimis rule, and the problem of the retroactive application of the relevant regulation in the case of aid granted before it entered into force? 3. Does the fact that the de minimis rule does not apply to certain categories of aid, such as agricultural aid and export aid, while special provisions apply to aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, regional aid and aid to save enterprises in difficulty, contribute to legal certainty, simplification of the legislation and the correct interpretation and application of the relevant rules by enterprises and the national authorities? 4. Does the Commission intend to adopt a more comprehensive approach to the de minimis rule based on the elimination of regional disparities and on regional cohesion?
