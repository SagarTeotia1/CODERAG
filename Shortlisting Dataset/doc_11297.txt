WRITTEN QUESTION E-2169/10 by Renate Sommer (PPE) to the Commission (7 April 2010) Subject: Protection of species in Italy 2010 is the UN Year of Biodiversity. The year is therefore specifically devoted to protecting nature in all its diversity. A citizen has drawn my attention to the fact that precisely the existence of this diversity of species is evidently threatened in Italy by an initiative of the national government. She says that the Italian Government has been repeatedly trying to amend the law on hunting to adapt it to the wishes of hunters. After failing already three times in the face of opposition from the Italian public and various nature and animal protection associations, it is now attempting to weaken the law on hunting step-by-step, in several stages. The first step, she says, is an extension of the hunting times for migratory birds, in respect of which, according to the draft law, a hunting permit is now to be valid for seven months instead of the previous four months. This would particularly affect turtle doves, thrushes and quail. Is the Commission aware of the facts described? Is an extension of hunting times for migratory birds in Italy compatible with EU law? Is the Commission planning, if necessary, concrete measures to prevent the protection of species and protection of biodiversity from being undermined?
