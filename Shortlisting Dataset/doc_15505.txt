5. Table 2 compares the margins remaining under the MFF ceilings in light of the DB relative to the margins that were available under the revised PDB. The ceilings are taken from table 2 of the annex to the Commission communication (2006) 327 of 22.6.2006, which updates the MFF figures in line with point 16 of the IIA of 17 May 2006.

The PDB figure for heading 5 has changed relative to Working Document 8 as a result of the revised estimates for "other institutions" . 6. The rapporteur recalls that his Working Document 8 provided an extensive analysis of PDB 2007 and emphasised the need for EU spending to be based on policy priorities given the limited resources available under the new MFF. In order to ensure value for money in the EU budget, the rapporteur underlines the contribution that cost-benefit analyses can make to focusing resources on priority areas. Setting policy priorities and improving value for money through cost-benefit analysis can also contribute to the preparing the 2008-2009 review of the MFF. This overall approach was set out in Parliament's resolution on the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy (APS) and further endorsed via the mandate voted in the Committee on Budgets on 11 July for the 14 July conciliation. 7. The rapporteur continues to consult with other committees in the process of preparing the European Parliament's 1st reading on the 2007 budget. At a general level, the rapporteur recalls the priorities set out in paragraph 6 of the APS resolution and re-stated in paragraph 5 of the mandate report. These priorities will be reflected in the Parliament's approach to the 2007 budget procedure. More specifically, and in light of the margins set out in table 2, the rapporteur considers that the amounts allocated to heading 1a and heading 4 appear particularly insufficient to meet the policy challenges facing the EU in these areas. The rapporteur also recalls the significant headroom available in the payments budget in this regard. II - Main changes in the Draft Budget: specific aspects and by MFF heading 8. Before outlining the main changes in the DB by MFF heading, there are three specific aspects of the DB that the rapporteur wishes to highlight. These are: (i) horizontal cuts linked to the quality of Activity Statements;
