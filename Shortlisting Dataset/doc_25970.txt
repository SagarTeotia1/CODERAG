9. Calls on the Council to broaden the mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), so that their lending policies can cover the whole range of the new European Recovery Plan (e.g. including sustainable industrial policy etc.); 10. Calls on the Council to establish a common EU bond, issued by the European Investment Bank, collectively guaranteed by EU-27 governments and backed up by national tax revenues as well as by liquidity support from the European Central Bank at its 1 per cent interest rate; points out that such a common EU bond should not only be used to fight financial speculation and eradicate current spreads on national sovereign debt, but especially for financing the new EU Recovery Plan; points out that not only the euro-zone countries, but all Member States shall benefit from credit creation via the common EU bond; considers that by financing investments via the EIB instead of borrowing on private capital markets, the EU and the Member States would save money which they could use for further investment stimulus; 11. Underlines that an employment and income multiplier between one and a half and two for such EIB led public investment can be reached, thus offering prospects that measures taken under the EU Recovery Plan can be self financing to a great extent; 12. Emphasises that any financial support to Member States via EU bonds must be linked to European Social Model principles, strictly steer away from public sector cuts, deflationary wage freezes, etc. and be sequenced in time so as to avoid pro cyclical fiscal retrenchment; calls on the Council to revoke the conditionality requirements imposed on Greece and also those imposed on Latvia, Romania and Hungary in the context of EU and IMF emergency assistance; 13. Calls on the Council to establish an EU level general Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) to curb speculation and to ensure that the financial sector contributes fairly towards economic recovery and re-financing the fiscal burden of public rescue operations; points out that according to recent studies, in Europe a general FTT of 0.1 per cent could raise annual revenues of 2.1 per cent of GDP (approximately 262 billion EUR); proposes that revenues from a general FTT should be used for development assistance, anti-crisis measures and for promoting sustainable development; 14. Points out that banks continue to have an implicit but strong guarantee on a public sector bailout even after the rescue operations and government guarantees (amounting to 3 trillion Euros in Europe), but that at the same time they do not have to pay any fee for this; calls on the Council to agree on a scheme for introducing balance sheet levies on bank’s liabilities (excluding deposits); points out that by modulating the levy rate in function of the size of the balance sheets, governments can increase the levy on big banks, thereby addressing the problem of banks becoming ‘too big to fail’; 15. Calls on the Member States to increase taxes on bank’s and manager’s bonuses, on income from capital (dividends, interest rates),
