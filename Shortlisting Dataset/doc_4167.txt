approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances, OJ 196, 16.8.1967, p. 1. ; however, given the current difficulties with hazard identification, an exposure assessment may well not be provided due to non-identification of hazards on the basis of existing methodology, even though an exposure assessment is crucial for a proper risk assessment of nanomaterials, – the REACH notification requirements for substances in articles only concern substances of very high concern that are on the candidate list and when they are present in concentrations above 0,1 % by weight in the article and in a total quantity of over one tonne in those articles per producer per year; however, as not a single nanomaterial is currently on the candidate list, such listing will be difficult in light of the problems with hazard identification of nanomaterials, and even if those problems could be overcome, the nanomaterials would most likely not exceed the tonnage and concentration thresholds, so that it is highly unlikely that REACH in its current form will lead to notification of nanomaterials in articles, Y. whereas waste legislation in the absence of nano-specific provisions may not apply correctly, for example: – adequate waste treatment depends inter alia on the hazardousness of a waste (e.g. acceptance criteria for different wastes in a landfill), but will not apply for nanomaterials as long as there is no agreed method for hazard identification, thus leading to non-specific treatment of nanomaterials depending on the general nature of the waste they end up in (anything from municipal solid waste to hazardous waste), – emission limit values for waste incineration only apply to certain known pollutants and not for nanomaterials, even though some might have to be classified as pollutants, or might have special requirements (e.g. carbon nanotubes, which can present asbestos-like properties, are stable until very high temperatures), Z. whereas the significant amendments concerning nanomaterials adopted in a first reading agreement between the Council and the European Parliament in the context of the recast of the cosmetics directive Position of the European Parliament of 24 March 2009, Texts adopted, P6_TA(2009)0158 . , and the significant amendments adopted by the European Parliament in the first reading of the review of the regulation on novel food Position of the European Parliament of 25 March 2009, Texts adopted, P6_TA(2009)0171 . , respectively, highlight the clear need to amend Community legislation to address nanomaterials adequately, Aa. whereas the current debate about regulatory aspects of nanomaterials is largely limited to expert circles, even though nanomaterials have the potential to bring about far-ranging societal change, which requires wide-ranging public consultation and full public participation in decision-making, Ab. whereas a broad application of patents to nanomaterials, as well as the excessive cost of patenting and the absence of patent access facilities for very small businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), could stifle further innovation, Ac. whereas the likely convergence of nanotechnology with biotechnology, biology, cognitive sciences and information technology raises serious questions relating to ethics, safety, security and respect for fundamental rights that need
