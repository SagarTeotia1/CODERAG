Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (1 September 2011) After the WTO Panel decision of the 5 July 2011, the Commission is closely following developments in China's policy on a number of raw materials, including rare earths, and remains concerned with export restrictions. At a first stage, the Commission looks forward to engaging in dialogue with China on its intentions as regards compliance with the WTO panel ruling, and encourages China to revisit its overall export regime in relation to raw materials. Export restrictions on rare earths are not the only concern, as indeed there are a range of other products on which China maintains export restrictions. The Commission wishes to see all of these restrictions removed and that Chinese policy be brought in line with this ruling. While the EU continues to deem that dialogue is be the best solution to the existing problems, the Commission has also stepped-up the work on the existing restrictions on other raw materials, and enhanced its cooperation with other partners on this issue. The Commission is now at the stage of seeking a number of clarifications on recent measures relating to rare earths, notably the new State Council Guidelines on the development of the rare earths industry.
