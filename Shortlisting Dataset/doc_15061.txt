Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (19 July 2011) The EU has closely followed the Syrian authorities' increasingly violent crackdown, including by military means, against peaceful protestors in many cities and villages across the country. The High Representative/Vice-President condemned these repressions in her statements repeatedly, calling for an immediate end of violence, respect for citizens' right to peaceful protests, and the release of political prisoners and human rights defenders without delay. The EU Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June 2011 reiterated its urgent calls on the Syrian regime to put an immediate end to violence, grant access to international monitors, humanitarian agencies, media and a mission of the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights. In the light of the continued violence, on 24 June 2011, the EU expanded its sanctions to include more Syrian individuals responsible for or associated with the repression, a well as a number of entities financing the repression. The four EU members of the UN Security Council have tabled a draft Resolution with a view to condemn the violence and impress on the Syrian authorities to change their current path. The EU is actively pursuing its diplomatic efforts with partners from the international community, notably those which have an influence on Syria.
