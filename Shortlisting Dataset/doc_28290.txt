the European Parliament is intended to provide the bases for designing a strategy to improve the integration of environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy, C. whereas the affirmation of the precautionary principle and the adoption of the FAO Code of Conduct lie at the foundations of the process of integrating environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy, D. whereas the fisheries sector is more often the victim than the author of environmental imbalances within the marine ecosystem, given that such imbalances arise from a development model which is external to the fisheries sector and is based on the uncontrolled exploitation of the environment and the coastal areas, E. whereas the integration of environmental protection requirements cannot be considered in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy alone, but rather the management of the marine environment as a whole, F. whereas the interaction between fisheries and the environment cannot be reduced to the supposed damaging effects of fisheries on the environment alone (overfishing of commercial stocks, risks to biodiversity and marine ecosystems, excess fishing capacity of the Community fleets, continuing risks of aquaculture); whereas, rather, reference needs also to be made to environmental measures which, if adopted, could directly improve matters for the fisheries sector (improvement of coastal areas, creation of restocking and nursery zones, protected marine areas, investment in research), G. whereas the Commission's alarm over the existing circumstances of overfishing and excessive fishing effort (arising from the excess capacity of the fleets) cannot be dispelled merely by reducing the numbers of vessels and the labour force, H. whereas awareness of the economic and social consequences of integration is essential if full integration is to be phased in effectively, and measures must be preceded by detailed assessments of the socio-economic consequences involved, 1. Points out that the appropriate legal basis for environmental policy is Article 175 and that specific legislation on the protection of the marine environment stemming from the review of the common fisheries policy must take account of that fact; 2. Considers that, if environmental-protection requirements are to be properly integrated into the CFP, the principles of that policy must include the Community environment policy principles set out in Article 174(2) of the Treaty; 3. Welcomes the analysis and the guidelines contained in the Commission communication and instructs the Commission to put forward specific proposals for a sectoral integration strategy to be incorporated into the current review of the CFP; 4. Reaffirms its determination to participate in the forthcoming review of the CFP with an approach based on the balance of the marine ecosystem, switching from a traditional resource management approach to an approach focusing on the ecosystem, including in relation to the adoption of TACs; 5. Calls on the Commission to improve its definition of 'ecosystem and socio-economic benefits' in relation to the integration of environmental policies into the common fisheries policy, given that, while it is true that short-term losses may be offset by long-term benefits, it is also the case that short-term losses are frequently damaging for the producers and can provoke economic crises
