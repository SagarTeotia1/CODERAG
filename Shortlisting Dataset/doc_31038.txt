Question for written answer E-9551/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Licia Ronzulli (PPE) (15 November 2010) Subject: School dropout rate In recent years the international economic crisis has caused an increase in the school dropout rate in all European countries. Finding a job, even if badly paid, is fast becoming a necessity for many young people. According to the latest official estimates, even though education levels have risen over the past 30 years, the school dropout rate is still very high, at 15 %, while the goal in the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce it to at least 10 %. In this regard, the EU programme Youth in Action 2007‑13 aims above all to improve the quality of support services for young people with problems (Article 2(1)(d) and Article 4(4)), by increasing their involvement in youth programmes and initiatives. Can the Commission therefore say what practical steps it intends to propose in order to reduce the school dropout rate for young Europeans? Will the Commission advise Member States to set up monitoring bodies in order to follow the activities of students and monitor the difficulties they encounter during their entire school career?
