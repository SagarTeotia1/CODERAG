Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (5 October 2005) Article 13 of the EC Treaty enables the Community to combat discrimination, inter alia , on the grounds of age. On the basis of Article 13 EC, on 27 November 2000 the Council adopted Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation OJ L 303, 2.12.2000 . . This directive prohibits discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, age, disability and religion or belief in employment, occupation and vocational training. It should be noted that discrimination in access to goods and services is not covered by Directive 2000/78/EC, although pay and working conditions are covered. This directive had to be transposed into national law by 2 December 2003, but the Member States had the possibility of up to three extra years to transpose the provisions on age and disability discrimination. The United Kingdom has used this possibility and, consequently, the directive's provisions on age discrimination will not be legally binding until 2 December 2006. Once that date has passed, individuals who believe that their rights under Directive 2000/78/EC have been breached must challenge this before the national courts. The Commission has very limited competence to intervene in complaints between private parties.
