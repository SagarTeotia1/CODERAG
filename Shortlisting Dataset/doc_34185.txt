in this area. Compensation payments for farmers Losses of income suffered by farmers as a result of restrictions on farming practices designed to protect groundwater can be offset under the regulation on rural development (Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005). Other points The compromise achieved makes the text of the directive clearer: concepts such as ‘background level’, ‘baseline level’ and ‘significant and sustained upward trend’ are defined unambiguously. Hydrogeological conditions must also be taken into account when setting threshold values. In this way, the directive reflects the differing conditions in individual parts of Europe and gives Member States greater freedom to decide precisely what implementing measures they wish to take. Contractual agreements may also be concluded, for example between farmers and water processing agencies or municipalities. More stringent national measures In some Member States, such as Denmark, a large proportion of public drinking water is obtained from groundwater, in most cases without even being processed. The protection of public health is sufficient justification for laying down more stringent limit values for pollutants, e.g. pesticides. Irrespective of the fact that the Treaties already lay down the right to take more stringent national measures, a majority of the members of the EP delegation were insistent that this should be explicitly laid down in this Groundwater Directive. The hard-won compromise with the Council provides for the incorporation of a reference to the Water Framework Directive in a recital: on that basis, and with the view to preventing or restricting inputs of pollutants into bodies of groundwater, Member States can also establish protected areas for these bodies of water. At the insistence of the EP delegation, it was made explicitly clear that such protected areas may also cover the entire territory of a Member State. Conclusion The final text can be regarded as a very satisfactory and balanced compromise. Many of Parliament’s second-reading amendments were accepted and satisfactory compromises were found on others. The outcome of the conciliation procedure can therefore be described as very successful for Parliament. The EP delegation is therefore recommending adoption of the joint text at third reading.
