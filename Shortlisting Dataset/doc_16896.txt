Answer given by Ms Wallström on behalf of the Commission (15 April 2005) The budgetary authority has entered an amount of €9 m in the 2005 budget under the heading ‘PRINCE-Debate on the future of the European Union’. An amount of €8 m will be made available to the Commission’s Representations in the Member States to support communication plans drawn up by governments under a tripartite strategic partnership (national government, European Commission, European Parliament). The Commission has made it clear that it will not intervene or fund Constitution activities against the wishes of Member States. It has not received a request for assistance from the United Kingdom Government under the Prince allocation.
