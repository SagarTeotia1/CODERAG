Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (25 August 2010) The Commission is aware of recent amendments adopted concerning Slovak legislation on Citizenship. According to the law of the European Union the conditions for losing and obtaining citizenship of the Member States are regulated exclusively under the national law of the individual Member States. Therefore, the Commission has no power to intervene with regard to national arrangements in place concerning the loss and the acquisition of citizenship. In relation to the issue of access to public service in Slovakia and the requirement of residence the Commission is currently assessing whether it is in all respects compatible with Article 45 TFEU and Article 7(2) of Regulation 1612/68/EEC Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community, OJ L 257, 19.10.1968. as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The Commission is in contact with the Slovak authorities in order to get more information.
