WRITTEN QUESTION E-1304/09 by Georgios Georgiou (IND/DEM) to the Commission (2 March 2009) Subject: Murderer of European national located in occupied part of Cyprus Kenan Akin, who murdered the Cypriot national, Solomos Solomou, in cold blood at Derinia in 1996, is standing as a candidate in the pseudo-elections which are expected to be held in the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus. He is a candidate for the ‘Freedom and Reform’ party of the so-called ‘Minister of Foreign Affairs’, Turgay Avci. This brute of a man, who murdered a Cypriot citizen in cold blood, has been sought by the Republic of Cyprus for 13 years in order to arrest and try him for the murder, while Interpol has also issued a warrant for his arrest. Power in the occupied territory is, as we all know, held by Turkey, with its army of occupation which it has maintained for 35 years on the island. What representations will the Commission make to the Turkish authorities to secure the immediate extradition of this criminal?
