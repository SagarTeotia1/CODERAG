both in the Assistant (AST) and the Administrator (AD) function groups (including linguistic administrators), for a high number of laureates. The reserve lists are expected by the first half of 2010, ensuring enough time for recruitments before the end of the transition period. Although the Commission has made good progress in the field of EU‑2 recruitments both in AD and AST function groups, the currently relatively high ratio of temporary staff indicates that other measures complementary to the ongoing external competitions are necessary. Consequently, internal competitions have been launched in January 2010 accessible to Bulgarian and Romanian officials and temporary agents.
