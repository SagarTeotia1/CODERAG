the application of the directive (in 2007 and 2010) have not revealed that difficulties in contacting the organiser or retailer would constitute a major consumer problem. The Commission is, however, aware that during the unprecedented situation which resulted from the closure of airspace in Europe caused by the Icelandic volcano in April 2010, many consumers experienced such difficulties. Unfortunately, the scale of the problem made it very difficult for air carriers and tour operators to provide all their passengers at the same time with the required re-routing and related assistance foreseen under EC law when re-routing was the choice of the passenger. In 2009 the Commission launched the impact assessment process to prepare for a possible revision of the directive. The issue of consumer complaints and the responsibility of the organiser/retailer to provide assistance to consumers experiencing problems with their package will be looked into in the revision process.
