Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2010) The Commission confirms that no new applications have been submitted concerning the Oporto-Vigo line. The EUR 244.1 million of TEN‑T funding are solely allocated to the Oporto-Vigo project and cannot be reallocated on proposal of the Member States concerned. For the current period, 2007‑13, three High Speed railway lines are foreseen to be co‑financed by the Cohesion Fund, namely the Oporto-Vigo line, the Lisbon-Oporto line and the Lisbon-Madrid one, and nearly EUR 1 billion is earmarked to finance them. The Commission has not yet officially received any request from the Portuguese authorities to reallocate these funds to the Lisbon-Madrid line. Should the Portuguese authorities decide to focus on the Lisbon-Madrid line, for which work is more advanced (both in Spain and Portugal) and for which contracts have already been awarded, the Commission will carefully examine any request for the reprogramming of current Cohesion Fund priorities, in the light of the justification put forward and of the priorities set in the Portuguese National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) for the period 2007‑13. TEN‑T funds are allocated through calls for proposal open to all Member States. As stated on the reply to the first question, so far the Commission has not received any request concerning the allocation of additional TEN‑T funding to the Oporto-Vigo line. No request has so far been received either, as regards the Cohesion Fund, from the Portuguese authorities, yet funding is foreseen under the current NSRF (QREN) for the period 2007‑13 for that line.
