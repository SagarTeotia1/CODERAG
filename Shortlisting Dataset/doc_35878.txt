Question for written answer E-003086/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (31 March 2011) Subject: Safety of Krško nuclear power station in Slovenia and implementation of Directive 2009/71/Euratom Krško nuclear power station, in south-eastern Slovenia, was built by Slovenia and Croatia in 1981 and became operational two years later, in 1983. The power station, which is 240 km from Venice and 130 km from Trieste, is in an area prone to earthquakes. Over the years, it has given rise to much concern owing to repeated incidents. Most recently, in 2008, a leak in the reactor’s main cooling system caused international alarm. Worrying events had also occurred previously: in 2007, the power station was isolated and closed for a month for urgent maintenance and, in 2005, the reactor was switched off owing to problems with the containment system for a steam treatment fan. Recently, a programme was announced to double the capacity of the power station by 2017, which alarmed neighbouring Member States, such as Italy and Austria, in view of the past incidents and given that earlier plans provided for the power station to be dismantled from 2023. In view of these events, does the Commission believe that it is possible to enlarge the above power station whilst respecting the safety of workers, the population and the environment? Can it confirm that Krško power station does not constitute a danger, even in the event of an earthquake? Does it intend to submit the power station to a ‘stress test’ or send in experts? What progress has Slovenia made in implementing Council Directive 2009/71/Euratom establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations, which must be transposed into national law by 22 July 2011? Has Slovenia already established the national legislative, regulatory and organisational framework and the relevant regulatory authority provided for in the directive?
