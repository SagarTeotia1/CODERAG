Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (26 November 2007) The Honourable Member is referred to the three Annexes which are sent directly to the Honourable Member and to the Secretariat of Parliament. Starting from a close-to-balance position in the mid‑1990s, the external balance of the Greek economy rapidly deteriorated since 1997 and posted a deficit of 8 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the early 2000s. Since then, the external imbalance has further widened leading to a current account deficit, above 11 % of GDP According to the Eurostat press release of 22 October 2007, the GDP has been revised upwards by 9.6 %. in 2006, one of the highest in the euro area. After adding the capital account, which is in surplus and mainly consists of EU transfers, Greece's net borrowing position was close to 10 % of GDP in 2006. In the late 90s, the trade balance (Annex A), which has traditionally been the main driver of the external deficit, widened by 5 percentage points of GDP to reach around 17 % of GDP in 2006. According to the Commission's 2007 autumn forecast, the trade balance is foreseen to deteriorate further, in the coming two years while the current account balance should remain around the level of 2006, close to 11 % of GDP. Among the euro area Member States, Spain and Portugal are foreseen to have in 2007 external deficits close to 10 % of GDP. There is not a direct link between interest payments and the external balance. In national account definition the budget balance (public savings) and the current account are however related. In terms of the revised GDP, interest payments have been in a declining path in the past few years, on the back of lower interest rates and public debt reduction. In particular, interest expenditures in 2002 were standing at 5.5 % of GDP with debt-to-GDP ratio of 100.8 %, while in 2006, interest expenditures were 4.4 % of GDP with debt-to-GDP ratio of 95.3 %.
