Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2011) The EU has been monitoring the case of Ms Nafeek, principally through its Delegation in Riyadh. Discussions on human rights issues and individual cases between the EU and local authorities take place regularly and the EU makes full use of these opportunities to convey appropriate messages to Saudi Arabia. According to the Saudi authorities, Ms Nafeek’s case is not yet closed. The EU will continue to follow it very attentively.
