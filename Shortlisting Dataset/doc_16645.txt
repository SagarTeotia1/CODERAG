Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) In its public consultation on family reunification, launched on 15 November 2011 COM(2011) 735 final. , the Commission has among other issues asked stakeholders whether administrative fees should be regulated at EU level, and if yes in what form, i.e. in the form of general safeguards rules or through more specific rules. Depending on the outcome of this consultation the Commission will decide whether any concrete policy follow up — including on this specific subject — is necessary (e.g. modification of the directive, interpretative guidelines or status quo). As regards the enforcement of the present rules, there is a case pending before the European Court of Justice which the Commission launched against the Netherlands. The Court is asked if the Netherlands has failed to fulfil its obligations under Directive 2003/109/EC and, accordingly, its obligations under Article 258 TFEU Case C‑508/10. by requiring third-country nationals and their family members to apply for long-term resident status and to pay high and unfair charges. The Commission considers it appropriate to wait for the outcome of this case before deciding on any possible steps and actions.
