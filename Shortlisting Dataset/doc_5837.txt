WRITTEN QUESTION E-6538/07 by Mikel Irujo Amezaga (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (15 January 2008) Subject: European Year of Equal Opportunities for All 2007 was the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, during which the Commission organised talks, round tables, seminars, etc., with a view to sharing best practices in the promotion of equality, and the EU institutions encouraged the Member States to implement policies favourable to equal opportunities for all. Nonetheless, examination of the current figures for the EU institutions shows that, out of 27 Commissioners, only eight are women — a telling fact about the EU institution which has the greatest influence on society. In the context of the closure of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, can the Commission provide data on the gender ratio for positions of responsibility (heads of service or unit, etc) within the Commission itself? Is the Commission planning measures to ensure that the EU institutions too implement equality policies?
