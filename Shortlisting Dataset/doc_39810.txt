9999/C Q999 E/053 WRITTEN QUESTION P-0599/04 by Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) to the Council (18 February 2004) Subject: Eastern Turkistan terrorism The Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is a small Islamic extremist group based in China's Western Xinjiang province. It is one of the most militant of the ethnic Uighur separatist groups pursuing an independent Eastern Turkistan. The ETIM are linked to the international muhajaden movement and they are suspected of having received training and financial assistance from al-Quaeda. In light of this and mindful of the fact that the ETIM have been put on both the United Nations and United States of America lists of global terrorist organisations, can the Council confirm that the EU is planning to take steps to follow the UN and United States actions by adding this group to its own list of terrorist organisations?
