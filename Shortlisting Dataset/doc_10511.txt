Reply (9 February 2009) The chain of command of the EU military operation Atalanta is set out in Council Joint Action 2008/851/CFSP of 10 November 2008 (OJ L 301, 12.11.2008, page 33), which provides the legal basis for the operation. Accordingly, the operation is under the command of Rear Admiral Philip Jones, who has been appointed as the EU Operation Commander. The EU Operational Headquarters are located at Northwood, in the United Kingdom. As usual for EU military operations, Force Headquarters have been set up, which are currently under the command of a Greek Commodore, as the EU Force Commander. Due to the specific conditions of a maritime operation, the Force Headquarters are located off shore, on board a ship. As this is the first EU naval operation, Atalanta will provide valuable experience in this regard and lessons learned from it will be duly analysed. Nevertheless, each EU military operation, regardless of whether it is a land or a maritime operation, is always subject, amongst other factors, to specific geographic, political and legal conditions which make it impossible to work on the basis of a standard template. EU Member States contribute to military operations on a voluntary basis and their decisions on contributing are subject to their internal decision-making procedures. Before a decision to launch the operation is taken, the Operation Commander needs to be sure that he has adequate forces at his disposal and he needs to be able to rely on the offers made by Member States. Therefore, even though there is no legal obligation to maintain forces at the disposal of the operation, Member States who provide forces make a political commitment, on which operational planning is based.
