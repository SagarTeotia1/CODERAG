Question for written answer E-007010/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Constance Le Grip (PPE) (15 July 2011) Subject: Future of the European Programme of Food Aid for the Most Deprived Persons (PEAD) Solidarity has been a fundamental value and an objective of the European Union from the outset, enshrined in the Treaties and implemented in practice. The European Programme of Food Aid for the Most Deprived Persons (PEAD) is probably one of the most tangible examples of this. However, the continued existence of the PEAD has recently been called into question by a complaint to the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning the way in which it is financed. This has led to a ruling contesting the PEAD’s legal basis, which has caused its budget to be slashed from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million. Europe’s citizens are having a great deal of difficulty understanding this ruling, since it jeopardises aid provided by numerous charities to 13 million deprived people, the current beneficiaries of this vital assistance. The Commission recently explained its stance in unequivocal terms: it is opposed to cuts in funding for the PEAD and deplores the impasse in the Council, caused by seven countries, regarding the continuation of the PEAD. On 29 June 2011 the Commission released a communication entitled ‘A budget for Europe 2020’, which proposed ‘transferring the scheme of food support for the most deprived persons to the ESF’. The ESF would thus become the new legal basis for the PEAD. 1. What does the Commission intend to do to support its stance and to ensure that funding for the PEAD is not cut? 2. What other solutions would the Commission consider to make up this shortfall from other sources of funding at European level? 3. If no new legal basis is forthcoming, what proposals could the Commission make to ensure the continuation of the PEAD from 2011 to 2013?
