Question for written answer E-9632/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Martin Ehrenhauser (NI) (23 November 2010) Subject: Changes to the CISA In its answer to Question E‑6837/2010 the Commission emphasises its support of demands made by the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority to introduce control mechanisms and periodic inspections of the use of the SIS. As these demands are met by the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Commission does not believe it necessary to suggest any modifications to the current SIS, claiming that the new system will be introduced within a short period of time. However, a further delay to the introduction of the new system became apparent in mid‑2010, which meant that the new system would not be in use until 2013 at the earliest and the control mechanisms would, accordingly, be unavailable until this date. 1. Does the Commission not believe that the further delay of several years justifies the application of its right of initiative in order to provide comprehensive protection for the rights of citizens? 2. Given that the Commission believes that no changes are necessary for this ‘short’ period of several years(!), how long does a period have to be before the Commission would be willing to modify a clearly defective system, in order to provide comprehensive protection of the rights of citizens?
