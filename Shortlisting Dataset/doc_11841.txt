the awareness in the sector. Indeed, available studies UNWTO and UNEP 2007 — Climate Change and Tourism: Responding to Global Challenges; OECD, 2007, Climate change adaptation in the European Alps. that have examined the climate change risk appraisal of tourism have consistently found low awareness of climate change and little evidence of long-term strategic planning in anticipation of future changes in climate. The Commission is convinced of the need for a comprehensive strategy on climate change addressing both its causes and consequences. The Climate Action and Renewable Energy package, adopted by the Commission in January 2008, provides the legislative tools to reach the greenhouse gas targets set by the European Council in March 2007, including a unilateral commitment of –20 % by 2020 compared to 1990 emissions to be scaled up to 30 % in case of an international agreement in the United Nations context. The Commission has also put forward a wide range of legislative initiatives on greenhouse gas emissions in areas such as cars, aviation and fuel quality. To follow up the Green paper on Adaptation to Climate Change, adopted in June 2007, the Commission is currently working on a White Paper to be adopted in the Fall 2008. The main objective of the White Paper is to arm the EU with an ambitious and effective strategy to limit the impacts of inevitable climatic changes and to place the EU at the forefront of international initiatives on climate change adaptation in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
