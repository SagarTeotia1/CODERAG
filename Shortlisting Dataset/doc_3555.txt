exists. Information . Producers must bear any net costs of information campaigns. Registration. All producers must be registered and, at Parliament's insistence, this must be done under similar procedures in all Member States, to ensure producers cannot duck their responsibilities. Exemptions . Parliament has sharply reduced the possible exemptions from the rules on collection and recycling that Member States wanted for small producers. These exemptions will be subject to strict conditions regarding compliance with competition rules. Recycling rates . The targets laid down in the directive for recycling are 65% by average weight for lead-acid batteries and accumulators, 75% for nickel-cadmium and 50% for others. Removability . At Parliament's insistence, manufacturers will have to design appliances in such a way that spent batteries and accumulators can be easily removed. Research . The EP has added provisions to the directive to encourage research into better technologies for recycling and for manufacturing less polluting batteries.
