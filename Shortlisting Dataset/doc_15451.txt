Recalls that its political priorities for the 2007 budget were set out in its abovementioned APS resolution of 18 May 2006; notes that paragraph 5 of that resolution set out the three key elements of setting policy priorities, ensuring qualitative value for money, and preparing for the 2008/ 2009 review of the 2007-2013 multi-annual financial framework (MFF); 2. Notes that this strategy has been put into effect in preparing the Parliament's first reading on the 2007 budget with policy priorities set out in paragraph 6 of the APS resolution, and re-stated in paragraph 5 of the mandate report for the July 14 conciliation with the Council; notes that these priorities were central to Parliament's budget amendments on priority programmes; 3. Remarks that this is the first budget under the new Financial Framework, under a new Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) and with many new multiannual programmes; remarks further that a new Financial Regulation should ideally apply for the implementation of the 2007 budget; 4. Highlights that, in line with the cost-benefit approach set out in paragraph 7 of the APS resolution, a qualitative value for money approach was started through policy hearings in the Committee on Budgets, and a thorough analysis of a number of sources of information on the quality of spending of EU funds and on budget implementation; notes that budget amendments were prepared inter alia on the basis of the information thus obtained; welcomes the fact that Council, Commission and Parliament all participate in a value-for-money trend; 5. Considers that the level of aggregate appropriations proposed by the Council in its draft budget falls well below the level needed for the EU to respond effectively to the challenges of globalisation it faces, which only serves to highlight the importance of the third strand of Parliament's strategy, preparing for the review of the MFF, which should deliver EU spending that is better focused on policy priorities; believes that by focusing commitments on priority programmes and by ensuring that funds are well spent, EU spending will better serve the interests
