Question for written answer E-9199/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Fiorello Provera (EFD) (8 November 2010) Subject: Iraq's national census On 4 October, the head of the Iraqi Central Organisation for Statistics, Mahdi al-Allaq, announced that Iraq’s national census would be delayed until 5 December. Originally the census was scheduled to take place on 24 October. Allaq said the reason behind the delay was to give enough time to solve the problems that had appeared in Nineveh province, where preparations for the census were halted over land disputes between Arabs and Kurds. But according to the Kurdistan Regional Government, the Iraqi Minister for Planning, Ali Baban, announced his Ministry’s total readiness to hold the census in 2009. On 7 July 2009, he announced that ‘the Ministry of Planning has completed all the preparations for holding the national census in all parts of Iraq’, even boasting that the census would be the best the country had ever witnessed. Fuad Hussein, who is the Kurdistan Region Presidency Chief of Staff, said in a statement that the Kurdistan Region Presidency would not accept any more postponements to a national census, affirming that a census must be held by the end of 2010. In the light of the Iraqi Government’s decision to delay the country’s first census in two decades, what steps is the Council prepared to take to gain assurances that the census will take place as per schedule? Is the Council prepared to assist the Iraqi Government in undertaking the census?
