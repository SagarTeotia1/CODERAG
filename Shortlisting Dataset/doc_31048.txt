the imprisonment of Mr Artsyom Dubski, who, according to Amnesty International, is a prisoner of conscience, as are those sentenced to 'restricted freedom'; calls for the immediate release of entrepreneurs Mikalai Awtukhovich and Uladzimir Asipenka, who have been held in pre-trial detention for eight months; 9. Firmly condemns the recurrent use of the death penalty in Belarus and points out that this runs counter to the statements by the Belarusian authorities in recent years indicating that they would gradually restrict the use of capital punishment; calls on Belarus to declare a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its abolition; expects that this issue will be efficiently tackled in the framework of the recently established Human Rights Dialogue between Belarus and the EU; 10. Insists that clear and significant progress towards democratisation must be achieved within the next year in order for the sanctions to be completely lifted and that the conditions for full re-engagement with Belarus should be: - respect for freedom of expression, association and assembly and the release of all remaining political prisoners, - freedom of registration for political parties and creation of favourable conditions for the operation of NGOs and independent media, - meaningful changes to the electoral law in line with the OSCE/ODIHR recommendations that ensure free, fair and transparent local elections in Spring 2010, including access to the media for all political parties during the campaign; 11. Calls on the Commission to make full and effective use of the possibilities to support civil society and democratic developments in Belarus via the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and stresses at the same time that support for democratic opposition must be an integral part of the gradual re-engagement process with Belarus; 12. Stresses that the visit to Minsk by the Italian Prime Minister has undermined the consistency and coherence of the EU's common policy towards Belarus; calls, in this respect, on the Member States to improve the coordination of their actions towards that country and to step up consultation before taking important bilateral initiatives with Belarus; 13. Takes note of the efforts to counter the effects of the financial and economic crisis and boost the economy by easing investment barriers and reforming property rights and the private sector, and of what has been achieved in this regard; 14. Stresses that the efforts made to tackle corruption, increase transparency and strengthen the rule of law, which are fundamental to attracting more foreign investment, have not been sufficient; 15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the parliaments and governments of the Member States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Parliamentary Assemblies of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the Secretariat of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Parliament and Government of Belarus.
