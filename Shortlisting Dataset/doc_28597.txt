Question for written answer E-5400/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Michał Tomasz Kamiński (ECR) (13 July 2010) Subject: Special Representatives for Moldova and the South Caucasus (Council) There have been reports that the High Representative has suggested abolishing the EU’s Special Representative posts in Moldova and the South Caucasus. Considering that the Special Representatives for the South Caucasus and Moldova (Peter Semneby and Kalman Miszei) end their terms on 31 August, would it not be to the EU’s advantage to extend the envoys’ mandates until the EEAS is fully operational? Both of these regions are conflict flashpoints which deserve the EU’s utmost attention. Removal of the Special Representatives from these regions may suggest to our eastern partners that relations with them are not among the EU’s priorities. This may prove highly detrimental to the security of the EU neighbourhood because it could downgrade our presence there. What is the High Representative’s position on this issue?
