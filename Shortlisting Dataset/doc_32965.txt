WRITTEN QUESTION E-2290/04 by Mario Borghezio (IND/DEM) to the Commission (5 October 2004) Subject: Turkish draft legislation punishing ‘flirtation’ Is the Commission aware that among the amendments recently proposed to the Turkish penal code there is a provision which punishes not only adultery but also ‘flirtation’ between persons under the age of eighteen and not yet married in accordance with Islamic rites? Does it not consider the adoption of such stances, which draw on very strict observance of the Sharia, to be irremediably prejudicial to the human rights protected by EU law?
