Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (5 May 2011) The review mentioned in the Commission's reply of 2007 to the Honourable Member remains on the Commission's programme although since then other priorities have intervened, notably the need to address fraud in the VAT system. It remains the intention to review the provisions in the VAT Directive on public bodies and the exemptions in the public interest. As a first step, the Commission has undertaken an in-depth study on the topic. This study has been published on the Commission's website http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/publications/studies/index_en.htm and will pave the way for any possible future initiative in this area. Currently a public consultation is taking place on the future of VAT Green Paper on the future of VAT — Towards a simpler, more robust and efficient VAT system, COM(2010)695 final. . Discussions as regards the VAT rules covering public bodies and exemptions in the public interest will take place in this context.
