Question for written answer E-001199/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President/High Representative) Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (9 February 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Financing of Hamas by Turkey According to recent articles in the Turkish press, Turkey has promised Hamas financial assistance of USD 300 million. A few days ago, Turkish President Abdullah Gül did not discount the possibility of the Islamic Palestinian organisation Hamas opening an office in Turkey. Will the European External Action Service provide the following information: 1. Does the Commission intend to investigate the truth of this report? 2. Given that such action is not assisting efforts to restore trust between Israel and Palestine, which the EU fully supports, especially in view of the resumption of direct peace negotiations, what action does the Commission intend to take? 3. How does the Commission plan to encourage Turkey to develop its foreign policy within the framework of dialogue and coordination with the European Union, in order to gradually bring its foreign policy into line with that of the EU, as urged by the European Parliament in its resolution on the 2011 progress report for Turkey?
