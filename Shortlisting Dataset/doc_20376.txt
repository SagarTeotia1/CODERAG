Question for written answer E-012300/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Cristiana Muscardini (PPE) (4 January 2012) Subject: Extension of the Baltic-Adriatic corridor In its sittings of 11 and 12 October 2011, the Committee of the Regions wisely gave its approval to plans to add the Marche Region and Ancona to the original route of the Baltic-Adriatic corridor. The whole of the Italian Adriatic region, and in particular the Marche Region, Ancona and its port, will benefit therefore from the corridor, with its planned intermodal connections, being extended southwards. With this decision, the Committee of the Regions is responding to the rational necessity for development of the Adriatic’s ports to be included in the corridor, taking into account the creation of the Adriatic-Ionian macroregion with the ensuing geopolitical strategies and options in regard to the EU’s financial programming for 2014‑20 and the reformulation of its financial programming for 2007‑13. These new development opportunities take account of the fact that Ancona’s port, Jesi’s interport and the airport at Falconara all form an integrated logistics system that offers great potential. Including the Marche logistics platform seems to us to be a logical final step southwards for the corridor, incorporating as it does the comprehensive network into the TEN‑T network. 1. Is the Commission aware of this decision by the Committee of the Regions? 2. Is it of the same opinion? 3. Does the Commission agree that including the Marche logistics platform in the Baltic-Adriatic corridor is logical from the transport system’s strategic perspective? 4. What steps will it take to ensure it is included?
