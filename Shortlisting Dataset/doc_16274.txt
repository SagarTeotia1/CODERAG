the democratic legitimacy and transparency of WTO negotiations. The report stresses the importance of the work done by the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO, which is organised jointly by the European Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), whose activities could be stepped up. Balanced secretariat The report stresses that the role of the WTO secretariat is critical, and believes that it is important that the secretariat has a proportionate representation of officials from developed and developing countries in order for it to discharge its mandate more effectively. Pre-accession The committee calls on the WTO members to consider the idea of a special pre-accession status for candidate countries which, while not having yet concluded their bilateral market access negotiations with their key partners in the organisation, pledge to take on without delay all the obligations resulting from the application of the existing rules. The report stresses that the decision on whether or not to admit a new member country to the WTO should always be adopted on the basis of strictly commercial considerations.

The negotiations have been intensified only in 2002 after the GCC started setting up its Customs Union that came into force in 2003. The 17th GCC-EU Joint Council and Ministerial meeting that took place in Riyadh on 8 May 2007 concluded that the parties were getting closer to an agreement. Given that Parliament needs to give its consent to the FTA after the entry into force of the Reform Treaty, could the Commission: 1) Set out the latest developments in the negotiations towards an EC/GCC FTA, the expected timetable and the region to region process? 2) Provide the European Parliament with information why the mandate has not been updated? 3) Explain what steps it is taking to improve the reciprocal market access for GCC and EU exporters, dealing with tariff and NTBs, especially with regard to the services, standardisation, chemicals, energy, transport, and food products sectors? 4) Explain if and what progress on investment has been achieved? 5) Explain how it addresses the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the GCC and the respect of human rights, workers and migrant workers' rights, environmental and social standards within the FTA negotiations? 6) Clarify whether it envisages to update the Sustainable Impact Assessment (SIA) and to take into account the results for the negotiations? 7)
