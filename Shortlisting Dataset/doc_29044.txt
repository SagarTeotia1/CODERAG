WRITTEN QUESTION E-1640/09 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (16 March 2009) Subject: Importation of radioactive stainless steel In a note of 10 February 2009 the German Government announced that radioactive stainless steel from India was to be found on the European market. On 13 February the Italian Stainless Steel Centre confirmed that it had received similar reports from two companies in the stainless steel screw sector, and a succession of further reports were received, again concerning long stainless steel products from India. On 19 February the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries asked the Commission to intervene to protect the market and European producers. I would like to point out, moreover, that on 2 June 2008, in Question E‑3044/08, I drew the Commission's attention to the importation into Europe of substandard stainless steels, referring to declared chemical composition which did not match the true composition. In its answer, the Commission stated that ‘if the goods concerned are declared as stainless steel without meeting these requirements, the Commission would adequately follow up the case together with the customs administrations of the Member States.’ In view of these fresh reports of radioactive material, the widespread distribution of which (e.g. in stainless steel screws and nuts and bolts) is very difficult to control, could the Commission say whether 1. it will now deal with the reported case; 2. it dealt with the case reported in June last year; 3. what measures it intends to take to prevent these illegal importations from taking place in future, given that they harm European producers and final consumers, also in terms of possible damage to health?
