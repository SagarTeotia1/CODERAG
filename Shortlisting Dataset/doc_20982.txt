Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (21 August 2006) The Commission recalls that there are no Community provisions establishing the right to redundancy payments. This field is solely of national competence. It follows that Ireland's Redundancy Payments Act cannot be considered to be incompatible with EU law. The Commission also recalls that the Collective Redundancies Directive Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies. provides that an employer who is contemplating collective redundancies shall begin consultations with the workers' representatives in good time with a view to reaching an agreement. The directive, however, does not include any provision entitling workers to redundancy payments. The Insolvency Directive Council Directive 80/987/EEC of 20 October 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer, OJ L 283, 28.10.1980, as amended by Directive 2002/74/EC, OJ L 270, 8.10.2002. provides for the protection of employees' rights in the event of the insolvency of their employer, in particular in order to guarantee payment of their outstanding claims (wages, pensions and other benefits). Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that institutions guarantee, where provided for by national law, payment of severance pay on termination of employment relationships. Here, again, the relevant provision does not establish the right to a redundancy payment. The provision only refers to such right where provided for by national law.
