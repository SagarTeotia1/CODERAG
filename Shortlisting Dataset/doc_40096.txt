2004/C 70 E/041 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1348/03 by Bill Newton Dunn (ELDR) to the Commission (10 April 2003) Subject: GATS and privatisation of water services The EU is now targeting 109 poorer countries with requests to privatise their water services. One problem with external corporations providing water services in developing countries is that this essential service is an important stage of development in a country, and one of the key indications of a decent government. There is therefore often great opposition, sometimes violent, to privatisation of water, which would be an irrevocable commitment. If some of these countries are to open up their public services to overseas corporations, are they being given the best possible advice about how to introduce safeguards so that their services are not primarily run for profit? And can the Commission give an example of where privatisation of water in a developing country has proved to be beneficial?
