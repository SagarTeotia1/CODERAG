WRITTEN QUESTION E-4439/08 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (11 August 2008) Subject: Suburban railway The construction of a suburban railway is a project which is being co-funded by the EU. However, scientific bodies and local authorities have complained that the refusal of the Greek authorities and the Greek Railway Organisation (OSE) to place that part of the project which goes right through the urban fabric of the city of Athens entirely underground, will undermine the quality of life of the inhabitants of theses areas, threaten the environment and endanger public safety. The Council of State also endorsed these reservations and on 17 March 2006 invalidated the environmental impact study for the project. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. What progress has the project made so far? Have the Greek authorities proposed that it be included in the 2007‑13 programming period? 2. After the invalidation decision by the Council of State, have any new environmental studies been carried out? If so, the Commission aware of their content? Does it consider that they are in line with Community legislation as regards environmental protection, protecting the quality of life of citizens and transport safety?
