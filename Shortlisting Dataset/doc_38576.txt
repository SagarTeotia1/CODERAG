WRITTEN QUESTION E-0411/07 by Luca Romagnoli (ITS) to the Commission (7 February 2007) Subject: Trade policy — relaunch of the Doha Round The Commission is seeking to relaunch the Doha negotiations with a view to facilitating the further liberalisation of international trade and potentially assisting the developing countries. In this connection, will the Commission say whether before pursuing this initiative it carried out in-depth studies into the effects which the ‘relaunch’ of Doha might have in terms of lost jobs and lost production capacity within the European Union? What kind of studies were carried out and can they be consulted? In any event, has the Commission carried out a detailed comparative assessment of the effect which the opening up of the Community market from 1992 onwards has had on the EU economy? If it has, can the relevant data be consulted?
