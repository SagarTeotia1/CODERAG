WRITTEN QUESTION E-3018/05 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (8 August 2005) Subject: European Investment Fund's Multi-Annual Programme for Enterprise The European Investment Fund was created in 1994 in response to an invitation from the Edinburgh European Council of December 1992. Its shareholders are made up of the European Investment Bank, the Commission and a number of financial institutions. The EIF operates through venture capital investments and SME guarantees. The March 2005 Brussels European Council urged the European Investment Fund to diversify its activities towards the financing of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). On 2 May 2005, the Commission launched a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007‑2013), one of whose sub-programmes, the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme, will be managed by the European Investment Fund. One of the main programmes currently operated by the EIF is MAP — the Multi-Annual Programme for Enterprise (2001‑2005). Can the Commission state whether the current MAP will be continued beyond its current term which is due to conclude at the end of this year? Can it indicate if a review of MAP (2001‑2005) is envisaged and if so, outline how participants and beneficiaries will have an opportunity to contribute to such a review? Can it indicate whether consideration has been or will be given to abolishing the requirement that interest has to be charged on all loans issued by national intermediaries under a future MAP? Can it outline how it is envisaged that the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007‑2013) proposal issued by the Commission in April 2005 will impact on MAP?
