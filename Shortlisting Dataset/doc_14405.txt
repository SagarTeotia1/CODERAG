Question for written answer E-000318/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Anna Záborská (PPE) (20 January 2012) Subject: Freedom of religion: proposal for a Council decision establishing a Multiannual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2013‑17 In its proposal for a Council decision establishing a Multiannual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2013‑17, the Commission proposes a list of thematic areas to be covered by the agency. Under the heading ‘Issues relating to fundamental rights which have been raised in recent years through the conclusions of the Council’, the Commission has, however, omitted to mention the conclusions of the 2973rd meeting of the Council held on 16 November 2009. At that meeting, the Council issued its conclusions on matters relating to freedom of religion and conscience (Council Conclusions (page 10 of doc [(15913/09 (Press 328)]). Why has the Commission not taken account of the Council conclusions of 16 November 2009 concerning freedom of religion and, consequently, included a specific thematic area in its proposal to the Council?
