WRITTEN QUESTION P-2470/06 by Joseph Muscat (PSE) to the Commission (1 June 2006) Subject: Directives Can the Commission inform Parliament when it will be able to answer a complaint filed by the Malta General Retailers and Traders Union — Chamber of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (GRTU) regarding alleged abuse of the rights of SMEs as stipulated under the Electricity Directive (2003/54/EC OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 37. )? Following its preliminary assessment of the complaint, does the Commission share the GRTU’s opinion that, in view of the electricity surcharge imposed by the Maltese Government, the rights of its members are not being recognised and sufficiently safeguarded? Is the Commission of the opinion that Council Directives 2003/96/EC OJ L 283, 31.10.2003, p. 51. and 2004/74/EC OJ L 157, 30.4.2004, p. 87. are not being adequately implemented in Malta?
