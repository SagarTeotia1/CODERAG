the Commission to draw up a study on the effectiveness of the method, which should examine: – the various stages of the procedure and the role played by all those involved, including the debate in the parliaments within the Member States, the consultation of the local and regional authorities and of the social partners; – the extent to which the various players" views, including the European Parliament's, are taken into account in the guidelines; – the comparability of Member States" reports, and the effectiveness of quantitative targets and dissemination of good practice; – the impact of the open method of coordination on national policies, looking not only at efforts made and results obtained, but also into the causal link between the application of the open method of coordination and the adjustment of national policy; 4.
