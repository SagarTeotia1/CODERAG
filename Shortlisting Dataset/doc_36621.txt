WRITTEN QUESTION P-4267/08 by Marcello Vernola (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 July 2008) Subject: Failure by Italy to incorporate the IPPC Directive into national law By means of Parliamentary Question E‑2692/08 the Commission was informed of the fact that the ILVA SpA company in Taranto had failed to comply with the requirements laid down in the directive on industrial emissions (IPPC) — a state of affairs which has a significant impact on health in the area around the company's factory. In its reply of 26 June 2008 the Commission confirmed that the directive in question was being contravened and it reported that it had opened an infringement procedure against Italy on account of the latter's failure to comply with Directive 2008/1/EC OJ L 24, 29.1.2008, p. 8 ; on 6 May 2008 it had issued a Letter of Formal Notice requesting the submission of observations within two months. Since that time limit has now expired and since administrative malfunction cannot be invoked by a State in order to justify non-compliance with EC law, does the Commission consider the Italian authorities' reply (if any has been received) to be satisfactory? If it does not, what action does the Commission intend to take in order to penalise Italy for its delays and non-compliance?
