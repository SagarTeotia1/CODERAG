Question for written answer E-002142/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Berlato (PPE) (4 March 2011) Subject: Cellular phone use and public health Following a study of the extent of penetration of children's and adults' brains by electromagnetic fields from single-band cell phones (GSM 900 MHz frequency band), the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) advises that studies in humans do not indicate that cell phones are safe, but nor do they clearly show that they are dangerous. Henri Li, a bioengineering professor at the University of Washington, has set up an archive of around 400 studies on the subject. This scientist has shown that the global incidence of brain tumours has not changed in recent years, but their incidence has increased in people between 20 and 29 years old, while it has decreased among older people, who use cell phones very little. According to Ronald Herberman, an American expert on cancer research, there is sufficient evidence for concern, but his position differs from that of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In its FAQ on cell phones, the FDA clearly states that there is no scientific evidence that they are dangerous and, if there is a risk, it is probably ‘very low’. Devra Lee Davis, an epidemiologist and UPCI director, has said that 20 different groups endorse the UPCI's recommendations and that the British, French and Indian authorities have already drawn parents' attention to the potential risks of mobile phone use by their children. In view of the information and research published in this field, 1. Does the Commission believe that it would be appropriate to support a scientific study into the possible risks to public health from electromagnetic fields associated with cell phone use? 2. Has the Commission already allocated funding for research projects of this kind?
