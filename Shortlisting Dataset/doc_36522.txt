Does it consider that the Greek authorities took the appropriate measures to deal with the pollution of the river and restore the region’s ground water? What measures does it intend to take to protect the environment and the health of the region’s inhabitants? Does it aim to propose the adoption of a specific programme to reduce the pollution of the Asopos? Would it be willing to co-finance a project of this sort if it is proposed by the Greek authorities?
