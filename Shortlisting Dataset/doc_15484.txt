further analysis is required in order fully to understand how the structure of spending on research is due to change in 2007 as a result of the start of the 7th Framework Programme and the changes to budgetary heading within the MFF. Education 26. The new Lifelong Learning Programme comprises: Comenius (secondary education); Erasmus (tertiary/ university education); Leonardo da Vinci (vocational training) and Grundtvig (adult learning) in addition to language-learning and ICT projects and the Jean Monnet programme. There is a significant increase planned in 2007 relative to 2006. Commitments rise by 29,6% in the PDB to around EUR 904 million. Trans-European Networks 27. The PDB foresees increased commitment appropriations (+17.7% relative to B2006) at EUR 853 million for Trans-European Networks, as a key to increased integration and competitiveness. Priorities proposed are: European Rail Traffic Management, European Air Traffic Management Master Plan, River Information Services and TEN loan guarantee instrument. Apart from those, a new Indicative Multi-annual Programme is being launched, which will focus on the development of cross-border sections. Galileo 28. The PDB includes appropriations for EUR 100 million for the Galileo satellite project. This is a new area of spending that did not exist in FP 6. Social Policy 29. Additional financing has been proposed for the Social Policy Agenda. The Commission requests commitment appropriations to be raised by 8.4% as compared to 2006, to reach a level of EUR 156.8 million in 2007. A new programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS, 2007-13) integrating existing programmes in the area accounts for a major part of the increase. According to the Commission (PDB document II, page 19) appropriations under title 04 "employment and social affairs", chapter 04 "employment and social solidarity" are planned to rise by 11,75% to EUR 125 million. European Globalisation Adjustment Fund 30. One should also note the planned creation of the European Globalisation adjustment Fund (budget line 04 05 01). This is intended to deal with some of the negative impacts of the process of globalisation. Implementation of the Fund would be via amending budgets. As per the results of the IIA negotiations, it is intended to finance the new Fund outside of the MFF through unspent appropriations. Heading 1b - Cohesion for growth and employment Overview 31. Heading 1 b covers the Structural Funds: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) plus the Cohesion Funds. It relates to the following policy areas: regional policy, employment and social affairs. The Commission puts emphasis on the contribution that the new Structural and Cohesion programmes can make to achieving the Lisbon goals. 32. According to the PDB the funding under this heading will be distributed in the following way. For the Structural Funds EUR 38 365 million for commitments and EUR 32 843 million for payment appropriations are foreseen. For the Cohesion Fund EUR 7 122 million for commitments and EUR 4 947 million for payment appropriations are planned.
