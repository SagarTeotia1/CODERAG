Answer given by Mrs de Palacio on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2003) Corridor VIII was not defined by the European Council of Essen. The Pan European Transport Corridors were defined by the Pan-European Conferences of Ministers of Transport in Crete in 1994 and Helsinki in 1997. These corridors, crossing the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and connecting with the network of the Union, made it possible to co-ordinate the interventions of the various authorities, including those of the Community, that already supported the Central and Eastern European countries through the PHARE and ISPA programmes. The mandate of the High Level Group, chaired by Mr Van Miert, was to identify priority projects on the transeuropean transport network, (TEN-T). Its report, which was advisory, assisted the Commission in its revision of the guidelines of the TEN-T. As Corridor VIII is located outside the territory of the Union, (with the exception of the ports of Bari and Brindisi) it was not within the mandate of the Group to consider it for inclusion in the list of TEN-T priority projects. By the same logic the Commission did not include it in the recently adopted Decision on the revision of the TEN-T guidelines Decision No 1229/2003/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 laying down a series of guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decision No 1254/96/EC , OJ L 176, 15.7.2003 . .
