WRITTEN QUESTION E-2835/07 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (5 June 2007) Subject: Information on the the Endesa company's new Cristóbal Colón combined-cycle power station at Huelva (Spain) The answer by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission to Written Question E‑5540/06 on possible non-compliance with Directive 96/61/EC OJ L 257, 10.10.1996, p. 26. at the Endesa company's new Cristóbal Colón combined-cycle power station at Huelva (Spain) stated that the Commission had not previously been aware of the issue and did not have any specific details on the regulatory processes and controls imposed in relation to the operation of the plant. The Commission was therefore going to write to the Spanish authorities to request information on the application of Community legislation to the operation of the plant, before deciding on the appropriate action to be taken in accordance with its powers under the EC Treaty. Can the Commssion therefore say: 1. whether it has yet received the information requested from the Spanish authorities; 2. if so, whether it can pass on this information to the questioner?
