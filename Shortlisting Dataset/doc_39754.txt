WRITTEN QUESTION E-5029/05 by Sebastiano Musumeci (UEN) to the Commission (10 January 2006) Subject: Postponing the creation of the Mediterranean free-trade area The effectiveness of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership policies and the utilisation of MEDA funding (MEDA 1 and MEDA 2) have not come up to expectations and have not adequately prepared the right conditions to ensure that the establishment of the Mediterranean free-trade area becomes an instrument for ‘creating an area of shared prosperity’. The universally acknowledged failure of the recent summit marking the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Conference confirmed that the countries in the Euro-Afro-Asian basin are ill-prepared for the opportunities and risks inherent in the planned free-trade area. Can the Commission say whether: 1. it does not consider it appropriate and necessary to postpone the date of 2010 for the establishment of the free-trade area; 2. whether and by what measures it intends to enhance the partnership policies in this context, so as to create the conditions for trade and agreement between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, and the European Union's ability to maintain a presence in the Mediterranean and help to bring about peace, in order to ensure that the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration may be pursued and achieved fully?
