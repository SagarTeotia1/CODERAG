President Hans-Gert Pöttering will announce that the written declaration on microcredit has been adopted.

The written declaration calls for human and financial resources to be allocated to microcredit projects in the developing countries and in the Mediterranean. Thursday 8 May 2008 Parliament will debate the hot topic of activities of lobbyists in the European institutions . A mandatory public register for lobbyists, common to the Council, Commission and Parliament and providing for "full financial disclosure", is proposed by the Constitutional Affairs committee. Lobbyists would also have to comply with a code of conduct and face sanctions if they infringed it. The report was initially drafted by Alexander Stubb (EPP-ED, FI) who has since left the European Parliament to become Finland's Foreign Minister and has been taken up by Ingo FRIEDRICH (EPP-ED, DE). The House will also tackle the Commission's White Paper on Sport . The fight against doping should be stepped up, and clearer guidelines are needed on how EU rules should apply to sport, says an own-initiative report proposed by the Committee on Culture, Education and Sport. In a report that outlines the EU's policy on sport, MEPs in the committee voice concern about the possible deregulation of gambling markets; warn against new rules that could create direct discrimination in player selection and the selling of TV rights. 20080430IPR28008 Briiefing - 7-8 May 2008 (Brussels plenary session) Final draft agenda - 7-8 May 2008 EN 2 LINK /sides/indexPartSession.do?reference=2008-05&language=EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20080418BRI27037 FULL-TEXT NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
