Council & Commission Statements Latest on Iraq Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in Iraq 29.01.2003 Javier SOLANA , the High Representative for the EU’s common foreign and security policy will make a statement on Iraq. United Nations (UN) weapons inspector chief Hans Blix recently met Elmar Brok – President of the Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee and will be speaking to political group leaders before the debate. The debate follows the live video conference between Pat Cox and Hans Blix following Mr Blix’s report to the UN on weapons inspection. Withdrawal of North Korea from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Council and Commission statements on the withdrawal of North Korea from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Debate: 29.01.2003 The Council and the Commission will make statements on the withdrawal of North Korea from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). On 10 January this year, North Korea announced it would withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. This follows on from North Korea expelling two International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear inspectors from the country on 26 December last year. The IAEA subsequently passed a resolution on 6 January demanding that North Korea readmit UN inspectors and abandon its secret nuclear weapons programme "within weeks", or face possible action by the UN Security Council. MEPs are likely to express that they deeply regret the official announcement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. EU Member states have already expressed their grave concern on this unilateral step taken by North Korea and maintain their hope that North Korea will reverse to a more positive attitude which would defuse the present situation of crisis and would safeguard peace and security on the Korean peninsula. In this regard, MEPs are expected to call on North Korea to fully comply with its international commitments concerning the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in a visible and verifiable manner. On a more positive side, the Commission recently adopted a humanitarian aid decision worth €9.5 million . The funding will be channelled through the World Food Programme (WFP), which has distribution outlets at community level in the country. This aid will help fill the gap resulting from decisions by other donors (Japan and US) to reduce their bulk food aid programmes. On 16 January, at the last plenary session in Strasbourg, MEPs passed a joint resolution on the humanitarian crisis in North Korea.
