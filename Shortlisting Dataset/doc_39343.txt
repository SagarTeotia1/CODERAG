Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (23 April 2010) All textile and clothing products placed on the EU market either of EU origin or imported from third countries have to comply with EU legislation. In particular, textile products have to comply with provisions on restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances as laid down in Annex XVII of the REACH Regulation Annex XVII of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC, OJ L 396, 30.12.2006. . Furthermore, textiles placed on the market in the EU have to be safe, as does any consumer product, in accordance with the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) Directive 2001/95/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 11, 15.1.2002. . Economic operators have a duty to place only safe products on the market, whether manufactured in the EU or imported. Market surveillance authorities have all the necessary powers to enforce this obligation. Customs authorities of the Member States check the import of products and cooperate with the market surveillance authorities. As a result of the actions taken by Member States' authorities, textiles have indeed been withdrawn from the market when they did not comply with EU legal requirements or were found to be dangerous as can be seen in the EU Rapid Alert System for Dangerous Non-Food Products (RAPEX) www.rapex.eu. . The Commission has no information about EU countries neglecting to check imported textiles for the presence of chemicals. Of course, new risks can emerge due to the use of, so far, unknown chemicals in the manufacture of consumer products in third countries. When there is evidence of a serious risk from a product, the Commission can propose a rapid action under the GPSD Article 13 of the GPSD. . A ban was introduced for dimethylfumarate (DMF) which was found particularly in leather products and which caused severe skin reactions in consumers. Since 1 May 2009, DMF must not be present in consumer products in the EU.
