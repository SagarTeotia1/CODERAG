WRITTEN QUESTION P-3624/09 by Urszula Gacek (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 May 2009) Subject: Ban on keeping dogs on chains All animals should be treated humanely, yet in many EU countries, including Poland, families keep their dogs on chains. The owners are often unaware of the serious harm they are causing the animals. Organisations and societies for the protection of animals are campaigning for legislation banning the keeping of dogs on chains or any other type of tether, in Poland, for example, through a campaign called Zerwijmy łańcuchy (‘Let’s break the chain’). Under European law special protection concerning the way in which animals are restrained is afforded to farm animals and animals in zoos, animals used for entertainment purposes, performance, film, sports and other specific purposes, as well as laboratory animals. In light of this situation, could the Commission please answer the following questions: — Are there any European standards which ban the keeping of dogs on chains? — Is the Commission currently working on legislation to address this problem? — Is there any possibility of adopting specific instructions or recommendations at European level that would ban the keeping of dogs on chains? Since other animals are protected against being tethered, could a ban on keeping dogs on chains also not be introduced at European level in the context of the protection of pet animals?
