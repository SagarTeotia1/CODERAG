Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (7 January 2008) The Commission monitors the Human Rights situation in Iran very closely and is aware of the case of Abdullah Al‑Mansouri. The Commission welcomes that the Government of the Netherlands has finally been given access to Mr Al‑Mansouri as well as the Netherlands’ subsequent announcement that Mr Al‑Mansouri has not yet received a verdict. The Commission strongly encourages the Iranian Government to ensure that Mr Al‑Mansouri will receive a fair and public trial, in accordance with international law and as per the international conventions the Islamic Republic of Iran has ratified. The Commission also joins the Government of the Netherlands in its call on Iran to keep earlier promises that an official Dutch representative can attend further court proceedings.
