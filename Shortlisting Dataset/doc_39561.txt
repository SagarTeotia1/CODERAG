WRITTEN QUESTION E-0731/06 by Mogens Camre (UEN) to the Commission (24 February 2006) Subject: WTO members' infringement of the organisation's rules According to a telegram from the Danish news agency ‘Ritzau’ on 6 February 2006, the small African country of Djibouti has prohibited imports and sales of Danish goods as a result of the campaign which some Arab countries are waging against Denmark. A number of other Muslim countries have followed suit but they have been astute enough to make it appear not to be an official boycott. Libya and Iran, however, have declared an official trade boycott of Denmark. Djibouti, on the other hand, differs from those countries in that it has been a member of the WTO since 1995. In the light of this situation, will the Commission say what it intends to do when WTO Member States directly contravene the organisation's rules and indicate what possible sanctions it envisages in the specific case of Djibouti's infringement of WTO rules?
