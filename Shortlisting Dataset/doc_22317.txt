Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (1 August 2008) The Commission has supported the submissions to list spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) and porbeagle ( Lamna nasus ) under Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) which were proposed to the CMS Secretariat by the EU. Regarding the listing of other shark species such as angel sharks in CMS appendices, the Commission is not aware of any proposal in this sense, but would of course study and consider such proposals on their own merits should they be presented.
