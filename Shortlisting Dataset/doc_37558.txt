WRITTEN QUESTION E-0306/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (2 February 2005) Subject: Alternative service for conscientious objectors in Greece Seven years after the introduction of alternative service for recognised conscientious objectors in Greece, the duration of this service (7.5 times longer) is still disproportionate to the objective sought, with the result that it discourages people from registering as conscientious objectors and punishes those who venture to do so. The violation of the fundamental rights of conscientious objectors, as well as the principle of non-discrimination and freedom of religion and beliefs, is continuing in spite of opposition from many quarters, such as the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the National Commission for Human Rights and Amnesty International, and despite Greece's commitment to adapt its national legislation. The case of Mr Petromelidis, who is being prosecuted (he has been imprisoned three times for the same offence) and has been forbidden to leave the country owing to his refusal to perform a punitively lengthy alternative service, is indicative of the situation in Greece. Bearing in mind the long-standing nature and the severity of the violations, the obligation for each Member State to implement the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and the resolutions of the Council of Europe, as well as the Treaty of Nice (Article 7), what steps will the Commission take to ensure that the competent Greek authorities comply with their international obligations?
