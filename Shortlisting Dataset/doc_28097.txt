Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2012) The Commission's Communication on ‘An EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child’ envisages a series of actions that address the situation of children in contact with justice systems. These actions are aimed at strengthening the rights of children as victims, suspects and detainees through development of evidence-based policies, legislative and non-legislative measures. The EU Agenda also encompasses initiatives to strengthen the rights of children when they are vulnerable, for example migrant children, Roma children, children with disabilities, etc. The communication does not foresee any particular action targeted at children of adults in prisons. As part of the consultation process in preparing the EU Agenda, the Commission organised expert group meetings on child-friendly justice, invisible children and violence against children. The results and conclusions of these expert groups have been considered in the drafting of the EU Agenda. In line with the Stockholm Programme, the Commission is also reflecting on ways to strengthen mutual trust and mutual recognition in the area of detention, in accordance with and within the limits of EU competence. To that effect, the Commission has published a Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention COM(2011) 327. . The Commission will carefully analyse all responses received to the Green Paper before deciding whether any action at European level is required.
