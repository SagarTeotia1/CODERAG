Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2011) The Commission strongly welcomes innovation and investment in new technologies and processes which result in better waste management, particularly when this results in applying methods that are higher up the waste hierarchy. Recycling ranks among the top waste management options enshrined in Article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, OJ L 312, 22.11.2008. . Absorbent hygiene product waste can be particularly problematic and the solution referred to by the honourable member is innovative. It is for Member States to define how they will meet their waste management obligations, but the wide divergence of performance of Member States shows that exchanges of experience and good practice would be beneficial. Several Community programmes provide possibilities for supporting investments in waste facilities.
