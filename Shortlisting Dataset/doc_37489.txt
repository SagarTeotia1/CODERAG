WRITTEN QUESTION E-2150/09 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (ALDE) and Ignasi Guardans Cambó (ALDE) to the Commission (31 March 2009) Subject: Failure on the part of the Spanish Government to comply with bird protection legislation Last year, the Commission opened proceedings against Spain with regard to its failure to comply with Council Directive 79/4009/EEC OJ L 103, 25.4.1979, p. 1. of 2 April 1979 on protection of woodland birds. Several of Spain’s autonomous governments, including those of Galicia and Catalonia, were deemed to be in breach of this directive, in view of the fact that the areas they have designated as special bird protection areas were neither numerous nor extensive enough. What stage have these proceedings, above all with reference to the Autonomous Communities of Galicia and Catalonia, currently reached?
