WRITTEN QUESTION P-0793/07 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (14 February 2007) Subject: Abuse of dominant position in the distribution industry Because of the substantial degree of concentration in the distribution industry, large distribution chains, whether or not with cross-border operations, are able to bring enormous pressure to bear on the suppliers of their products. Not only with regard to price, which is a good thing from the point of view of the European consumer, but also with retard to contractual payment agreements between distributors and suppliers, which are often SMEs. Suppliers are often compelled to provide pre-financing free of charge for large distributors. There are examples of suppliers being allowed to display their products in shops but receiving payment only after they are sold, with a delay of many months. Such practices are laid down contractually in payment conditions. Has the Commission received any complaints about such undesirable payment practices? Does not the Commission agree that certain contractual relationships are so one-sided that they should also be classified as abuse of a dominant position? Ought not action to be taken against these practices?
