Question for Question Time H-0432/2010 to the Commission Part-session: September II 2010 Rule 116 Czesław Adam Siekierski (PPE) Subject: EU employment policy Unemployment is the main social problem facing Europe as it continues to grapple with the effects of the economic crisis. Young people in particular are affected by the lack of employment opportunities. According to a Eurostat survey, the average rate of unemployment many people under 25 in Europe is 20%. The worst affected countries are Spain, Estonia and Latvia, where the figure is as high as 40%. Unemployment poses a serious threat to society. Studies have shown that it leads to an increase in crime, anti-social behaviour and illness. Another group hard hit by unemployment are older people reaching the end of their working lives. Research shows that most unemployed persons over 50 are too poorly qualified to compete effectively in the labour market, while firms are unwilling to invest in training those in this age group, who often have a dilatory or resigned attitude to looking for work, as well as suffering discrimination. Given that unemployment affects those at both the beginning and the end of their working lives, what is the EU currently doing to tackle this question and what results have been achieved so far?
