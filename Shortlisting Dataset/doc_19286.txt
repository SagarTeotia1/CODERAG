Reply (18 July 2005) As stated in the replies to other recent Parliamentary questions, the European Council, at its meeting on 16 and 17 December 2004, discussed the embargo on arms exports to China. In the conclusions which it adopted on that occasion, it invited the Luxembourg Presidency to finalise the well‑advanced work in order to allow for a decision on this question. On that occasion, the European Council recalled ‘the importance of the criteria of the Code of Conduct on arms exports, in particular criteria regarding human rights, stability and security in the region and the national security of friendly and allied countries.’ Work continues, on this basis, in the Council's preparatory bodies. The Council maintains its position on the question of Taiwan, encouraging dialogue as a means of resolving conflicts and calling on both parties to avoid any unilateral action which could increase tension. The Council is not in the habit of commenting on opinions which have appeared in the press, and would point out that it has not had an impact study carried out of the repercussions of lifting the arms embargo on relations with the United States in the military technology sphere.
