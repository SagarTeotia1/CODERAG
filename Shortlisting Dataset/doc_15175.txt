the Commission adopted, on 7 December 2005, the biomass action plan COM(2005)628 final. . This plan proposes more than 30 actions to promote biofuels in the European Union, in particular for transport biofuels. They include the promotion of ‘biofuels obligations’, through which suppliers include a minimum proportion of biofuels in the conventional fuel that they place on the market. Furthermore, the Commission adopted on 8 February 2006 the abovementioned EU strategy for biofuels, with a range of potential market-based, legislative and research measures to boost production of fuels from agricultural raw materials. It is worth pointing out that the Commission engaged in a dialogue with the European automotive industry regarding alternative fuels in the framework of the CARS 21 High Level Group. The industry confirmed that their vehicles are already capable of using biofuels in up to 5 % blends and has indicated their willingness to enter into discussions on increasing this level further if required. EU support to research, technological development and demonstration in the field of biofuels is done through the framework programmes for research. Last but not least, the Commission also supports the European technology platform for biofuels, which was officially launched on 8 June 2006. This platform brings together (amongst other things) biofuel producers, the car industry, agriculture and forest based industries and researchers. The strategic research agenda and deployment strategy developed by this platform will be an important input to the definition of research priorities in the seventh framework programme and beyond.
