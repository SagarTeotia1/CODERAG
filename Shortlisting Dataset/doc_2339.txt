Question for written answer E-010282/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Rovana Plumb (S&D) (9 December 2010) Subject: Combating violence against women Violence against women, in all its forms, is a serious problem in the European Union. Around 20 % to 25 % of women are subject to physical violence in the course of their adult lives, and over 10 % of women are victims of sexual violence. The European Parliament has adopted a motion for a resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union — 2009, and has called, among other things, for: — a proposal for a directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women, and especially their trafficking; — the institution, in the next five years, of a European Year of combating violence against women; — the establishing of a European inter‑gender violence monitoring centre, and the introduction of the European protection order for victims and a common EU‑wide telephone helpline for victims (endorsing, in fact, the proposals made by the Spanish Presidency). What stage has been reached in the measures undertaken by the Commission in response to Parliament’s resolution, and in achieving the objectives defined during the Spanish Presidency, in the field of combating domestic violence?
