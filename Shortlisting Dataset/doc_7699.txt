Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (28 September 2004) 1. The Commission recently adopted Commission Decision 2003/881/EC of 11 December 2003 concerning the animal health and certification conditions for imports of bees OJ L 328, 17.12.2003 (Apis mellifera and Bombus spp.) from certain third countries and repealing Decision 2000/462/EC of 12 July 2000 OJ L 183, 12.7.2000 . This Decision was adopted with a view to reducing the threat posed by two emerging pests. Neither the United States nor any part of its territory has been explicitly excluded from exporting queen bees to the EU under the Decision. However, it may be that certain third countries may not at the moment, fulfil the more stringent animal health requirements that are considered necessary to protect EU bees. 2. The Decision was introduced specifically to protect the EU bee population from small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) and the tropilaelaps mite. The EU is currently free from these parasites, but they have caused serious damage to bee populations in affected third countries. Once established, they are almost impossible to eradicate as there is no safe effective treatment that destroys these pests.
