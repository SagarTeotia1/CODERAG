Question for written answer E-008236/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (15 September 2011) Subject: Oligopolistic control over film distribution within the EU It has been a long‑standing complaint of European film producers that their films, if they can be made at all, are ‘squeezed out’ of potential cinema screens by the Hollywood ‘majors’, whose tendency to pay enormous advance fees to leading actors and high rewards to studio executives means that they must be able to guarantee large numbers of opening screens for several weeks around the world, even for films that do not turn out to be successful at the box office. The claim is not that any formal deals are made between distributors and cinema owners, but that there exists an unspoken understanding that refusal to take up an unpromising film may lead to difficulties in acquiring the right to show the next Tom Cruise or Matt Damon blockbuster. Some years ago, the Commission looked at this issue, but was reported to have been so impressed by the arguments presented by the array of legal talent assembled by the American Motion Pictures Association under the leadership of Jack Valenti that it decided to ignore the protests of European film-makers, and thus let things be. Meanwhile, the European film industry has continued to decline, with American ‘kidult’ movies increasingly dominating the share of box-office takings around the world. The truth, or otherwise, of European complaints over distribution practices within the EU could be established, and any possibility of de facto competition infringements eliminated, by making it a legal requirement that any film licensed to be shown in any EU Member State should be made available to any licensed cinema wishing to show it, thus removing the possibility of any untoward leverage by the major distributors. Will the Commission consider introducing such a measure, and, if not, give its reasons for not doing so?
