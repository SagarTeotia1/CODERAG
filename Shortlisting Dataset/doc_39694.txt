help to promote economic growth and trade between Euro-Mediterranean countries; 25. Stresses the need to strengthen cooperation in the field of energy and calls for the immediate promotion of development plans to encourage the diversification of energy supply sources and routes, thus making a decisive contribution to energy security in the Mediterranean region; 26. Recalls the high potential of sources of renewable energy – in particular wind and solar energy – in the Euro-Mediterranean region; supports the swift, coordinated implementation of the Mediterranean Solar Plan, the main aim of which is to establish, by 2020, 20 GW of new renewable energy production capacity in the Mediterranean, and industrial initiatives such as DESERTEC, in addition to the adoption of a Euro-Mediterranean energy efficiency strategy; hopes that the projects will, as a matter of priority, meet the needs of supplier countries and stresses the effects that the strengthening – particularly on the southern shore – of the network infrastructure, the gradual establishment of an interdependent regional market and the creation of a new industrial sector, such as that of solar components manufacturing, will have on the economic development of partner countries; 27. Calls for further promotion of, and support for, the ‘Solar for Peace’ initiative within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Market Integration Project (MED-EMIP); 28. Recommends that the countries participating in the Euro-Mediterranean process join the ‘smart cities’ initiative envisaged under the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan; 29. Supports the promotion of trans-Euro-Mediterranean interconnections in the electricity, gas and oil sectors in order to improve energy supply security; emphasises the importance of completing the Mediterranean electricity loop and supports the development of a southern gas corridor; encourages the use of reverse flows where it is justified in terms of security, cost-effectiveness and viability; 30. Stresses that the 20-20-20 climate objectives will affect gas demand significantly, therefore the creation of an LNG action plan for the UfM member countries would improve diversity and security of supply, especially for countries relying on sole suppliers; 31. Stresses the importance of progress in LNG technology and investments in LNG vessel transportation capacity and LNG re-gasification terminals; points out that, alongside infrastructure development, maritime security is also a necessity; 32. Emphasises the urgency of developing stronger cooperation in the field of civil protection in the Mediterranean region to combat natural disasters, particularly earthquakes, floods and forest fires; encourages the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean forest fires institute; 33. Stresses the importance of developing, within the UfM framework, new projects focusing on education, school and university exchanges and research as ways of bringing the peoples on both sides of the Mediterranean closer together and fostering development; considers that priority should be given, with the active involvement of civil society, to the creation of a genuine Euro-Mediterranean higher education, science and research area and, in this regard: – welcomes the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean University (EMUNI) and calls on partner institutions to deepen their commitment to the development of its activities; – calls for increased funding to be devoted to academic exchange programmes such as ‘Erasmus Mundus’ and for better
