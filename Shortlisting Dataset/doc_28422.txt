Question for written answer E-005359/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Lucas Hartong (NI) (6 June 2011) Subject: The multiannual financial framework and the role of Parliament and Council In consequence of Article 312(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Lisbon Treaty), the Council has to decide unanimously on any interim adjustment to the multiannual financial framework (Financial Perspective). This is to be enshrined in a regulation; as yet, however, this has not happened as the European Parliament was not in agreement with the regulation drawn up to that end. At present the Inter-Institutional Agreement (IIA), whereby qualified majority voting applies to any budget adjustment, is still in force. The Lisbon Treaty prescribes unanimity, but Parliament has so far refused to agree to this, even though the Council has proposed a contingency margin of 0.03 % of EU GDP as a concession demonstrating some flexibility on the budget. That being so, I should like to ask the following: 1. The matters for discussion in the Committee on Budgets currently include the 2012 budget. In this context the ITER project will be raised, for which all kinds of budget restructuring will take place in order to find necessary additional funding. Does the Council agree with the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) that the Council’s decisions on these issues must be taken unanimously? 2. Does the Council agree with the PVV that accordingly every proposed amendment to the 2012 budget should be subject to unanimous agreement from the Council? 3. Does the Council agree with the PVV that it is high time for the European Parliament to accept the Council’s proposed Regulation of 21 December 2010 (No 16973/13/10), since we are now effectively in a kind of legal no-man’s land?
