Question for written answer E-011622/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (9 December 2011) Subject: Stricter rules for rating agencies The Commission has submitted a proposal to establish stricter rules for rating agencies. The proposed measures include requiring agencies to provide advance notification of any changes to their evaluation methods, obliging issuers to change their rating agency every three years, and requiring Member States to be assessed every six months However, the proposal contains no provision for the non‑disclosure of the ratings of at‑risk countries. Yet the issue of not disclosing sovereign ratings has long been under discussion. This matter, therefore, remains unresolved. — How does the Commission intend to ensure that any non‑disclosure of the ratings of at‑risk countries does not have a negative impact on the confidence of the financial markets?
