Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (10 March 2005) The Conclusions of the European Council of December 2004 refer to the extension of the Association Agreement with Turkey to the ten new Member States. In paragraph 19 of the Conclusions, the European Council ‘welcomed Turkey’s decision to sign the Protocol regarding the adaptation of the Ankara Agreement, taking account of the accession of the ten new Member States’. In this light, it welcomed the declaration of Turkey that ‘the Turkish Government confirms that it is ready to sign the Protocol on the adaptation of the Ankara Agreement prior to the actual start of accession negotiations and after reaching agreement on and finalising the adaptations which are necessary in view of the current membership to the European Union’. The Commission has taken the necessary steps to prepare for the adoption of the Protocol referred to above. It is also continuing to encourage Turkey to remove the various restrictions on its relations with the Republic of Cyprus. It is a fact that, according to Article 49 TEU, accession negotiations are conducted between the Member States and the Applicant State. In this context, the Commission would like to remind the Honourable Member that in the 2004 Recommendation on Turkey accession to the EU, the Commission recalled that: ‘accession negotiations will take place in the framework of an intergovernmental conference where decisions require unanimity and with full participation of all EU members’.
