Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (20 June 2008) The European institutions have repeatedly addressed the situation faced by Roma across the European Union. The Commission is using all available legal, financial and policy tools at its disposal to improve the situation of Roma in Member States, candidate countries and acceding countries. Notably, EU‑funds are available for Member States for financing the integration of migrants and ethnic minorities. In response to the request formulated by the European Council in December 2007 and the recent resolutions of Parliament, the Commission is preparing a report on the Community instruments and policies in favour of the inclusion of Roma, which is due in June 2008. Directive 2004/38/EC Directive 2004/38/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC, OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, allows Member States to refuse the right of residence to EU citizens who do not comply with the conditions attached to the right of residence i.e. that they are workers Under the transitional arrangements laid down in the Accession Treaty, Italy restricts access of Romanian nationals to its labour market under national law by applying a work permit scheme. , are self-employed or have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members so as to not become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State as well as comprehensive sickness insurance. Their right of residence can also be restricted on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. Under the directive, EU citizens and their family members are protected by procedural safeguards. If they are denied entry, residence or expelled, the decision must be notified in writing and in a way that they are able to comprehend its content and the implications for them. The decision must include precise and full information of the grounds on which the decision is based and it must also specify the court or administrative authority with which they may lodge an appeal and the time limit for the appeal. Citizens must have access to judicial redress. Save in duly substantiated cases of urgency, the time allowed to leave the territory may not be less than one month from the date of notification. Italy brought into force the directive by adopting Legislative Decree No 30 of 6 February 2007 implementing Directive 2004/38/EC. This text has been recently amended by Legislative Decree No 32 of 28 February 2008 which foresees the modalities for appeal against expulsion decisions in Article 22. Should an EU citizen consider that the expulsion measure taken against him/her does not conform to Community law, he or she can appeal before the national courts.
