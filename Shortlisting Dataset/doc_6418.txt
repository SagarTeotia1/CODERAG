WRITTEN QUESTION E-3693/05 by Albert Deß (PPE-DE) to the Commission (14 October 2005) Subject: Beef imports from Brazil According to my information, the EU Commission has granted a further grace period to Brazil so that it may prove the traceability over a period of at least 90 days of beef cattle being sent to the EU. This is said to be the result of an inspection trip by EU experts. 1. Is this in accordance with the facts? 2. If so, how can it be explained that the EU certification process for cattle breeders in the internal market is so meticulously controlled and even procedural errors are punished, while goods from overseas may be brought in at will in large quantities? 3. What do the traceability controls individually entail? 4. Through the varying treatment of the same situation, the conduct of the EU distorts competition and increases the existing fears of European farmers. 5. What reasons may be given for the fact that exports of beef into the EU from third countries are constantly rising (e.g. Brazil increased its beef exports by 30 % from 2004 to 2005)? 6. What is the reason for the roughly 39 % increase in beef imports into Europe outside the preferential quotas at reduced rates of duty to more than 130000 tons in the 2004/2005 GATT year? 7. The increase in beef exports into the EU is explained by the fact that the price of beef has risen substantially since the agricultural reform which encourages cheaper imports from outside countries. The price difference arises from the fact that quality requirements increase the price of European products. And then Europe is helping the importers of beef as regards the controls (animal identification, see above). 8. How do you quell the suspicion that the internal EU principles of quality and traceability have been sacrificed for political aims and, as a result, European farmers once again suffer?
