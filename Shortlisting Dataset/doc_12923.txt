normal part of the budgetary procedure and may reduce or increase the Member State's GNI. The Member State's GNI-based contributions are then adjusted accordingly involving also payment of arrears. No interest is calculated as a result of these revisions. However, should a Member State fail to meet its obligations to pay the contributions established and requested by the Commission in due time, interest will be charged. The decision on Structural Funds allocations for the period 2007‑13 has been part of the Financial Perspectives as agreed by the European Council on 15 and 16 December 2005. This decision was based on the GDP and GNI data available at the time of the financial perspective negotiations. Subsequent revisions of GDP and or GNI figures do not alter the decisions on Structural Funds eligibility or allocations for the period covered by the current Financial Perspectives. Future receipts from the cohesion fund (post 2010) might however be affected by the revision.
