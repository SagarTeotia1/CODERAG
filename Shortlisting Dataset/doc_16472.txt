Nairobi, on the conflict in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC). Mr Michel said, "I congratulate the heads of state of the region on the willingness they have shown to bring the conflict to an end through a negotiated settlement in which regional structures are to play a decisive role." He welcomed the direct involvement of African diplomacy, in particular through the nomination of former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Benjamin Mpaka as facilitators and mediators in the conflict. The region has also declared itself willing to play a direct part in finding a solution to the conflict. The Commissioner confirmed that he was ready to support the international community in rebuilding the eastern part of the RDC.

Although the accounts themselves have been approved without qualification, the same cannot be said of the "transactions underlying the accounts". The Court said that for the 14th year in a row it was not able to issue a "statement of assurance" that the EU money had been spent well and according to the rules in all policy areas. The Court had some good news as well. Expenditure on administration and for economic and financial affairs (enterprise, internal market, etc.) got a clean bill of health, as did the revenue side of the EU budget. There were improvements in internal policies and external actions, though not enough to affect the overall judgement. But the policy areas of agriculture, research, energy and transport, external aid, development and enlargement, education and citizenship were still "affected by material levels of error". The most prone to error were funds to promote economic and social cohesion, where some 11 per cent of the spending was not in line with the rules. In other policy areas the level was between 2 and 5 per cent. When presenting the report to the Budgetary Control Committee, Court of Auditors President Vítor Manuel Da Silva Caldeira took care to point out that this concerned irregularities such as the omission of a public tendering procedure or the co-financing of VAT. Asked by Jean-Pierry Audy (EPP-ED, FR), who is the rapporteur on the 2007 discharge, about possible fraud and the ratio between fraud and irregularities, Mr Caldeira said that the Court was not a judicial authority and could only notify others, i.e. the EU fraud-fighting office OLAF, when it finds clear indications of possible fraud.
