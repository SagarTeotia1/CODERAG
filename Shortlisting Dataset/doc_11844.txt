Question for written answer E-006423/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (30 June 2011) Subject: Agricultural subsidies Food-related deadly diseases, including heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and others, are on the rise. Diets that are heavily meat-based or high in sugar, fat and salt require expensive treatments which contribute to the escalating financial costs for citizens and publicly funded health services. Recently released dietary guidelines in the US ask Americans to follow a healthier diet and increase their intake of fruit and vegetables United States Department of Agriculture: www.choosemyplate.gov . A fair distribution of available funds is needed in order to support healthy choices and help growers producing these products. Given the fact that the EU should be promoting the consumption of foods that are healthy and have little environmental impact while at the same time pushing for sustainable policies in the agriculture sector, the Commission is asked: 1 What percentage of agricultural subsidies in the EU supports meat and dairy products, including cereals and other crops that are used as animal feed, and what percentage goes to fruit and vegetables? 2 Will it consider a fair distribution of available funds to support farmers and encourage growing of fruit and vegetables throughout the EU? 3 Will the Commission further support with subsidies and information campaigns the consumption of healthy plant-based food so that it is less expensive for the consumer? 4 Are the health benefits associated with the consumption of fruit and vegetables reflected in the Commission’s food and health policies and in dietary guidance provided for consumers?
