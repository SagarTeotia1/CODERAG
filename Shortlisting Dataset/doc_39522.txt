Question for written answer P-011998/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kartika Tamara Liotard (GUE/NGL) (13 December 2011) Subject: Absence of legislation laying down minimum standards for the protection of dairy cattle and farmed fish The Community has approved the European Convention for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, by Council Decision 78/923/EEC, and this Convention has been ratified by most Member States. Council Directive 98/58/EC of 20 July 1998 concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes has established general provisions applying to all farmed animals in relation to construction requirements for animal housing, insulation, heating and ventilation conditions. In addition to those general provisions, the Community has adopted different pieces of legislation laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens (Council Directive 1999/74/EC of 19 July 1999), for the protection of chickens kept for meat production (Council Directive 2007/43/EC of 28 June 2007), for the protection of calves (Council Directive 2008/119/EC of 18 December 2008) and for the protection of pigs (Council Directive 2008/120/EC of 18 December 2008). 1. Could the Commission explain to what extent it intends to prepare legislation laying down minimum standards for the protection of other species, and in particular for farmed fish and dairy cattle? 2. If it does intend to do so, could the Commission indicate what the time frame would be? 3. If not, could the Commission explain why?
