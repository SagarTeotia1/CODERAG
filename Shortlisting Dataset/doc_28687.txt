Question for written answer E-010188/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (8 December 2010) Subject: Property investments Does the Commission have or does it plan to implement legal protection for EU citizens who have invested in property schemes in other EU Member States which turn out to be a scam or fraudulent? Is there an EU agency which could intervene to assist those EU citizens whose wish was to engage with the possibilities offered by the EU’s common internal market but who lost money in the process due to the fraudulent behaviour of another party, e.g. a property developer? What monetary or legal assistance is available for EU citizens to claim their investment back?
