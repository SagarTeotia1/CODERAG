Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (28 November 2007) The Commission would like to confirm to the Honourable Member that no decision has yet been taken by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Members on whether or not to hold a Ministerial Conference before the end of 2007. More specifically, at the October meeting of the WTO General Council — where all WTO members are represented and which conducts the functions of the Ministerial Conference in the intervals between meetings of the Ministerial Conference — members concluded that, given the uncertainty as to the further process and timing of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, it is premature to determine a date for a Ministerial Conference. Such a Decision will have to be taken at one of the next meetings of the General Council (in December 2007). Although, it is correct that Article IV.1 of the WTO Agreement requires a Ministerial Conference to be held every two years, the Commission does not consider it productive to insist on the holding of a Ministerial Conference in 2007 if no important decisions have to be taken in the context of the Doha Development Agenda. Under such conditions, a Ministerial would only be a pro-forma event and detract attention away from the negotiations. If a Ministerial takes place in early 2008 to take decisions in the context of the DDA, such a delay should not be problematic.
