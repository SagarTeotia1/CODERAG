Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (13 February 2007) Several Community directives lay down procedures of information and consultation of workers' representatives which can apply in the event of restructuring of companies. In the situation described by the Honourable Member, the following two directives seem to be especially relevant: Council Directive 94/45/EC on the European Works Councils Council Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees, OJ L 254, 30.9.1994. and Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework relating to information and consultation of workers in the EC Directive 2002/14/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community, OJ L 80, 23.3.2002. . Council Directive 94/45/EC has been transposed into Italian legislation. The Commission would like to point out that it is up to the competent national authorities to ensure its correct and effective application and to ensure the fulfilment of any company's duties in this regard. As for Directive 2002/14/EC, the Italian authorities did not inform the Commission of the adoption of any national provisions necessary to transpose the directive into national law. The Commission therefore launched infringement proceedings against Italy for non-communication on the basis of Article 226 of the EC Treaty. The case is currently pending before the European Court of Justice (C-327/06). With regard to the second point, the Commission would like to remind the Honourable Member that takeovers constitute a capital movement and that the EC Treaty prohibits unjustified restrictions to the freedom of capital movement. In particular, Article 56 of the EC Treaty stipulates: ‘Within the framework of the provisions set out in this Chapter, all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited.’ Although the EC Treaty does not define the term ‘movement of capital’, it is settled case-law that Directive 88/361/ EEC Council Directive 88/361/EEC of 24 June 1988 for the implementation of Article 67 of the Treaty, OJ L 178, 8.7.1988. , together with the nomenclature annexed to it, may be used for the purposes of defining what constitutes a capital movement. According to this nomenclature, direct investment in the form of participation in an undertaking by means of a shareholding or the acquisition of securities on the capital markets is to be considered as a capital movement. The explanatory notes in that annex state that direct investment is characterised, in particular, by the possibility of participating effectively in the management of a company or in its control. Therefore, the acquisition of controlling stakes, as well as the full exercise of the accompanying voting rights, in domestic companies by other EU investors, is also considered to be a form of capital movement Communication, op. cit., paragraph 2.3. These points have been confirmed by the recent ECJ rulings, among others, in cases C-483/99, Commission v France , C-367/98, Commission v
