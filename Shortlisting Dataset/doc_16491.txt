identify problems relate to complaints, price levels, satisfaction, switching and safety. "These five indicators are relevant and useful," the report says. Price indicators are important for consumers Some stakeholders have raised questions on the use of price indicators, since prices are "influenced by so many factors". The report argues that prices are important for consumers and price indicators are easy to communicate. "While most market failures, directly or indirectly, will have an effect on the consumer price the price level indicator combined with other indicators related to the effective functioning of the market will most likely provide valid results." Increased awareness To raise awareness of the scoreboard, the committee stresses the importance of disseminating the information in "an easily accessible language", making the scoreboard visible on relevant websites, and stepping up media coverage. Consumer Markets Scoreboard to be kept separate from the Internal Market Scoreboard Since 1997, the Commission has been using the Internal Market Scoreboard to monitor and highlight the Member States implementation of internal market legislation. MEPs recognise the importance of this tool, which encourages Member States in taking their part in the common and continuous effort to develop the single market, but state that "it is not likely to build trust from the ordinary consumer" because it doesn't "communicate the Internal Market to the consumer". In view of this, Consumer Markets Scoreboard should "complement" the Internal Market Scoreboard, but should be kept separate.
