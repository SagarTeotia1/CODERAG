ORAL QUESTION H-0926/05 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Esko Seppänen to the Council Subject: Agricultural co-financing The Presidency is drawing up the EU’s new financial perspective for 2007 to 2013 and, as part of that process, known to be planning a package that would serve to reduce the rebates granted to the United Kingdom and other large net contributors as well as including ‘other measures’. Does the Presidency consider an overall solution of this kind to be feasible, given that it would alter the arrangement previously agreed as regards agriculture and Member States would consequently finance a higher proportion than hitherto of their agricultural support out of their own funding?
