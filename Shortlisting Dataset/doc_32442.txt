It is also continuing to obstruct Cypriot accession to the International Export Control Regime. In view of the specific undertakings given by Turkey within the negotiating framework, in particular paragraph 7, adopted by the Council of Ministers on 3 November in Luxembourg, what view does the Commission take of Turkey's continued refusal to meet EU conditions even after commencement of the negotiation accessions?
