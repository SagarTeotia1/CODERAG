Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (13 October 2006) The Commission supports the right of civil society to participate in an open and constructive debate with official representatives in conjunction with the IMF and World Bank annual meetings. Thus, on 15 September 2006, the Commission together with Member States made a démarche to the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This was done in parallel to a similar action by the IMF and World Bank. The Commission is glad to say that these combined efforts reversed almost totally the decision made by the Singaporean authorities to refuse entry to the country to representatives of civil society organisations. The Commission continues to monitor certain authoritarian aspects of the behaviour of the Singaporean Government and is in regular dialogue with the authorities on the issues of democracy and fundamental freedoms.
