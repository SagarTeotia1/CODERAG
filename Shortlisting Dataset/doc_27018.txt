WRITTEN QUESTION E-2629/07 by Ashley Mote (ITS) to the Commission (23 May 2007) Subject: Why another Google at taxpayers' expense? Why have taxpayers' funds been allocated by the EU to pay for the invention of a competitive Internet search engine to rival Google, which already has several competitors? Is this decision, and the associated waste of public funds, another example of the anti-Americanism which infects the EU?
