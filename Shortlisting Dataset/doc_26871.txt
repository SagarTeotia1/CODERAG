the LOW building in Strasbourg that Parliament "is the sole owner of the LOW building in Strasbourg, and may use or dispose of it as it thinks fit," which accords with the idea that the Parliament as the democratic representative body in the European Union has the right and the obligation to decide on the most cost-effective and efficient way of working, including in relation to its seat; WIC and SDM Buildings 11. Recalls that in May 2006 the Committee on Budgetary Control, in response to the referral back of its report, set up an informal Working Group tasked with advising and assisting the rapporteur in connection with allegations made over the existing lease arrangements and the prospective purchase by the European Parliament of the WIC and SDM Buildings in the City of Strasbourg; 12.
