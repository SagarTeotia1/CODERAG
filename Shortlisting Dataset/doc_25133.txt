Question for written answer E-011113/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Syed Kamall (ECR) (6 December 2011) Subject: Attracting inward investment into the EU I have been contacted by a constituent who works for a European provider of carrier-neutral collocation data centre services. My constituent tells me that the company is investing in additional facility infrastructure across Europe and has scheduled several large-scale developments, with more planned in the future. He says that over the past year the company has been involved in some significant connectivity infrastructure projects from China to Europe which should attract additional investment into Europe from a variety of Chinese business sectors, including banking, media, cloud, etc. He would like to know of the role of the EU and the Commission in attracting inward investment into the EU, specifically from China and the USA. Could the Commission confirm whether there is a department of the European Commission which my constituent can contact about attracting inward investment into the EU?
