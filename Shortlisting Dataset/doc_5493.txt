ORAL QUESTION H-0387/02 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Roy Perry to the Commission Subject: Extension of the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive To receive national TV channels by satellite outside their country of origin, it is necessary to obtain either an illegal decoder or a pirate card. Does the Commission agree that the Cable and Satellite Directive 93/83/EEC should be extended to allow some EU Member State satellite operators to transmit foreign channels, thereby allowing nationals of one state temporarily residing in another to view programmes from their home country?
