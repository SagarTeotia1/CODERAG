Question for Question Time H-000085/2011 to the Commission Part-session: March 2011 Rule 116 Saïd El Khadraoui (S&D) Subject: 2010 accident statistics In 2001, the Transport White Paper set the target of halving the number of fatal road accidents by 2010. In 2001, the number of people killed on Europe's roads was 54 000. By 2009 the number of fatalities had been reduced to 35 500 – a reduction of 35% in relation to 2001. In its communication of 20 July 2010, the Commission announced that it likewise intended to halve the number of deaths on Europe’s roads between 2011 and 2020. Does the Commission now have more accurate figures on the number of fatal accidents in 2010? Are figures available concerning the causes of the accidents, the drivers and the vehicles involved? What proportion of accidents in 2010 involved heavy goods vehicles? Is the Commission planning to cofinance any new projects in which thorough analyses will be made of the causes of accidents? If so, what?
