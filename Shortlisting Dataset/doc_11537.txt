Question for written answer E-005613/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (14 June 2011) Subject: Serbia in the EU Prior to his transfer to The Hague, the special war crimes court in Belgrade suspended the questioning of Ratko Mladic on account of his poor health. Mladic's lawyer told the press that the judicial authority carrying out the investigation had tried to question his client but had had to stop because of serious health problems affecting the defendant. He emphasised that Mladic was indeed in a very poor state of health. The deputy state prosecutor, Bruno Vekaric, announced that proceedings would recommence the following day, Friday, once Mladic had undergone a medical examination. Can the Commission state whether Mladic's arrest will pave the way for Serbia's accession to the EU?
