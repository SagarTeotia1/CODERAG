WRITTEN QUESTION P-3334/04 by Roberto Musacchio (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (7 December 2004) Subject: Immediate resumption of the round table discussions between government, trade unions, local authorities and Thyssen Krupp Given that: — on 12 February 2004 the European Parliament unanimously approved a resolution expressing solidarity with the workers of the AST steelworks in Terni and with the community in Umbria in the face of the wish of the Thyssen Krupp company to close down magnetic steel production, and calling on the social partners, local authorities and the Italian Government to seek a solution guaranteeing the future of all forms of steel production at the AST plant in Terni; — on 17 June 2004, at the round table talks set up within the Council of Minister and coordinated by the Minister of State, Mr Letta, Thyssen Krupp set out the main lines of an industrial plan to maintain and reinforce by means of massive investment all forms of manufacturing at the AST plant, including that of magnetic steel, in view of the undertakings entered into and already honoured by the trade unions, the region and the local authorities, with the Government undertaking to adopt a government decree responding positively to Thyssen Krupp’s proposal to obtain electricity supplies at competitive prices in relation to the group’s other European sites, and the freezing until 2012 of repayment of the indemnities owed in connection with the Italian energy nationalisation of the 1960s; — to date, the Government has not fulfilled this undertaking and, even more seriously, has recently endorsed the request by Thyssen Krupp to postpone indefinitely the round table, which was scheduled to take place on 23 November 2004 at the Council of Ministers with a view to signing a territorial agreement to take effect as soon as the industrial plan was made official; — formal and informal meetings of the trade unions have confirmed that Thyssen Krupp did not comply with the industrial plan’s guidelines drawn up on 17 June 2004 and, in an inexcusable volte-face, again proposed that production of magnetic steel be broken off and a number of secondary-steel-manufacturing companies under its control sold, despite the fact that the group’s net profits have risen to 844 million euros, representing an increase of 55%, and that the Italian magnetic steel market constitutes 60% of the European market; — the unions’ calls for the round table to be reconvened immediately, given that the products in question are of strategic importance for Italy, have met with no response, and the workers have remobilised to protest against the failure of both the Italian Government and the multinational Thyssen Krupp to abide by their undertakings; does the Commission intend to intervene with the Italian Government with a view to the immediate reconvening of the round table with Thyssen Krupp and the trade unions under the auspices of the Council Presidency?
