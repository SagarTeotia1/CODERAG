Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) The EU remains committed to work towards achieving a diplomatic solution for the Iranian nuclear issue which was discussed with the relevant Israeli authorities in the framework of the EU‑Israel Association Council which took place on 16 June 2008. In this context, the EU expressed its concern about the negative impact of Iranian policies on stability and security in the Middle East and underlined that Iran needs to play a responsible role in the region. The Commission fully backs the ‘E3+3’ and High Representative Solana’s efforts to solve the Iranian nuclear dispute, including the most recent meeting in Geneva with Saeed Jalili, Secretary of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council.
