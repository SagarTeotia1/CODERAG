Question for written answer E-012078/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (20 December 2011) Subject: Nuclear safety in Europe In the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan in March 2011, the European Commission decided to conduct a series of stress tests on all 143 nuclear power plants in the European Union. It has now published the interim stress test report, and the final results of the ongoing tests are to be revealed in June 2012. The stress tests are part of a set of measures to reinforce the security and protection of nuclear power plants in Europe. However, they have provoked a wave a criticism, for example with regard to the issue of the independence of the experts called on to draw up the individual reports — who are the operators themselves. It is in the operators’ interest to ensure that their facilities continue to operate as normal, and it is not in their interest for costly investments in upgrading and in modernisation to be imposed. The probability that these interim reports produced by the operators will be biased is relatively high. — Does the Commission admit that there is a possibility that nuclear plant operators in the individual Member States may be biased and that their interim reports may not be objective? — If so, what specific measures does it intend to take in order to ensure that the results of the stress tests are objective?
