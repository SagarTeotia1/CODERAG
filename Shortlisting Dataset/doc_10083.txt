Question for written answer E-006414/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (30 June 2011) Subject: Sudeten Germans — search for mass graves in the Czech Republic Over 65 years after the end of the Second World War, the murder of thousands of German civilians in the Czech Republic still seems to be a taboo subject. Journalists David Vondracek and Pavel Polak have reported on the criminal expulsions on radio and television. In one report, Vondracek focuses on unmarked mass graves, of which there are many in the Czech Republic. Polak stated that he had studied the documents of a committee which examined the worst excesses after the war and said: ‘Then the Communists came to power and the work of this committee was terminated’. The biggest mass graves were secretly exhumed and the remains taken away and burnt. The search for the ‘hidden’ mass graves is proving difficult. 1. Is the EU providing support for the search for these mass graves? 2. What help is the EU providing for the investigation of mass graves in the context of coming to terms with the past? 3. Is there EU funding for documentary films dealing with (Communist) war crimes?
