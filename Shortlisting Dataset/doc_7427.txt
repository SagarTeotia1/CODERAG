Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (18 November 2009) Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) 104/2000 Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, OJ L 17, 21.1.2000. states that the labelling of the commercial designation of species is compulsory for all fishery and aquaculture products on retail sale to the final consumer, where their presentation falls within Chapter 3 of the Combined Nomenclature. The same Article requires Member States to draw up and publish a list of the commercial designations accepted in their territory. Detailed rules for the application of this regulation are laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2065/2001 Commission Regulation (EC) No 2065/2001 of 22 October 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards informing consumers about fishery and aquaculture products, OJ L 278, 23.10.2001. . With regard to tuna, the national lists of commercial designations make it possible to differentiate bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) from other tuna species in the main European markets for tuna. This differentiation in actual fact is found in the lists of the three major EU bluefin tuna producers, namely France, Italy and Spain. According to Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2065/2001, it is the responsibility of Member States to establish arrangements for checking the application of these labelling rules. Member States must verify in particular that only tuna of the Thunnus thynnus species is labelled as bluefin tuna by retailers. An evaluation of the implementation by Member States of EU marketing standards on grading and traceability provisions, including information to consumers through labelling at the retail level, demonstrated that labelling of fish at the retail level was very variable throughout the European Union and that it was also quite unsatisfactory in some Member States. No particular problem was however noted about labelling of bluefin tuna. The major part of bluefin tuna which is caught by EU vessels is exported to Japan, some of which being exported after a period of fattening in cages in the Mediterranean Sea. The share of EU catches which is exported may be assessed by comparing production data with export data. Export data are not available before 2002 as bluefin tuna was not included yet in the Combined Nomenclature, before that date. EU Production (tonnes live weight) ( Source: DG Mare) EU Exports (tonnes net weight) (Source Eurostat) % 2002 18 129 7 800 43 2003 16 607 5 800 35 2004 17 284 11 800 68 2005 20 600 10 930 53 2006 19 167 12 411 65 2007 21 803 14 737 68 2008 14 963 10 356 69 According to these data, the share of EU bluefin tuna catches which is exported has been increasing and has now stabilised just below 70 % of EU production. The European market for bluefin tuna may be assessed to be at around 5 000 to 7 000 tonnes per year, roughly equally distributed among the three main markets of France, Italy
