Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (7 December 2011) The Commission is closely following the case that has led to the indictment of persons on the charge of alleged membership of the civilian branch (KCK) of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL terrorist organisation. The Commission has equally followed the most recent arrests of politicians, lawyers and intellectuals and has raised the issue with the Turkish authorities. The Commission has extensively reported on the issue in its 2011 Enlargement package and raised concerns about judicial procedures in connection with the KCK case in which around 2 000 politicians, locally elected representatives and human rights activists in the south-east have been detained since April 2008. The investigation continues to widen. The main KCK trial of 152 defendants (104 of whom are under arrest) charged with membership of an illegal armed organisation started in October 2010. However, the trial came to a standstill after the court refused to hear the defence in Kurdish. The EU Delegation to Turkey observed the first hearing of this case on 18 October 2010 and the Commission will continue to keep a close eye on the case. While reaffirming its complete solidarity with Turkey in the fight against terrorism, the Commission recalls that human rights must be respected in all circumstances. The Commission will continue to raise the issue in its regular meetings with the Turkish authorities.
