Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (6 August 2010) During his visit to Brussels on 1 March 2010, President Yanukovych underlined Ukraine’s continuing commitment to rapprochement with the EU. He stressed that this process depended on Ukraine implementing necessary reforms. This message has been repeated publicly by the President on several occasions and by Prime Minister Azarov, most recently at the EU‑Ukraine Cooperation Council on 15 June 2010. For its part, the EU has welcomed this commitment and has underlined the urgency of Ukraine’s engagement being matched by concrete reform steps in both the political and economic spheres. The EU remains ready to support and accompany Ukraine in this process. President Yanukovych has also pledged his support for concluding negotiations on the EU‑Ukraine Association Agreement, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) as an integral part, as soon as possible. The EU has welcomed this while underlining that further efforts are needed on the Ukrainian side, particularly as regards the DCFTA component of the Agreement, for this goal to be achieved.
