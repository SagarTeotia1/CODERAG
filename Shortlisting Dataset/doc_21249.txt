establish a Europe-wide network; 89. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider it a priority, with a view to reducing transport pollutant emissions, to invest in developing a pan‑European intelligent energy network that can harness energy generated at local and regional level, including from renewable sources, and which helps to develop the necessary infrastructure for the use of electric vehicles; 90. Considers that a cultural shift towards more sustainable modes of transport is needed; therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to encourage new forms of investment, so as to facilitate the modal shift to more environmentally friendly modes of transport and to reduce the need for transport, inter alia by applying IT and through spatial planning; 91. Stresses that the internalisation into transport prices of the external costs of transport, graduated by level of pollution, is a key challenge for stimulating energy savings and energy efficiency, and that increased performance will lead to an environmentally friendly choice of transport mode; 92. Calls for consistency with the Roadmap priorities to be ensured for the envisaged new transport infrastructure investments, recalling that the € 1.5 trillion over the next two decades between 2010-2030 requested by the Commission risk not to be channelled into adequate low-carbon priorities; stresses, therefore, the need to ‘green’ the EU’s infrastructure budget, especially in relation to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund; 93. Welcomes the proposed new guidelines for the Trans-European Transport Networks and the importance given to the development of rail corridors for passengers and freight; calls on the Commission to present, as soon as possible, a strategy for the use of alternative fuels and new technologies in transport; encourages the Member States to urgently implement the measures of the Single European Sky and thus improve the efficiency of aircraft and traffic management operations; 94. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement in full the legislation on aviation in the ETS; Agriculture 95. Calls on the Commission to propose specific measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote efficiency gains from the use of agricultural land and reduce the use of fossil fuel based fertilisers, taking particular account of the role of agriculture as producer of food (rather than fuel); is also of the view that smaller-scale farmers may require training and technical assistance in this area; also calls on the Commission to step up research on the functioning of different kinds of agriculture and effective agri-environmental practices, with due respect for prevailing climatic conditions; 96. Believes that agriculture is well placed to make a major contribution to tackling climate change and creating new jobs through green growth; notes that greenhouse gas emission reductions in the agricultural sector are a win-win option that can increase farmers’ long- term economic and agronomic viability; calls for the CAP to include targets for the use of sustainable energy; 97. Stresses that the CAP post-2013 is expected to enhance the above contribution; recognises that agriculture has already substantially reduced its emissions through improved production efficiency; notes, however, that, in the long run, the
