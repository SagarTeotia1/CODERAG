Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) The operation of the largest industrial installations in the EU is subject to Directive 2008/1/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) OJ L 24, 29.1.2008. . This directive requires installations falling under its scope to operate in accordance with permits including emission limit values based on the best available techniques (BAT), designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, generally to reduce emissions and the impact to the environment as a whole. The IPPC Directive is supported by other directives that set minimum requirements across the EU for certain polluting activities including Directive 2000/76/EC on the incineration of waste OJ L332, 28.12.2000. and Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants OJ L309, 27.11.2001. . These directives have been merged into the new Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions OJ L334, 17.12.2010. that further strengthens the application of BAT to industrial activities. Criteria for the distance between industrial facilities and the production areas for foodstuffs do not exist as Community legislation sets maximum levels for contaminants in the foodstuffs themselves Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs, OJ L 364, 20.12.2006. . The regulation contains maximum levels for different types of contaminants (e.g. heavy metals, PCBs and dioxins). The maximum levels ensure that humans are protected since products that exceed these maximum levels cannot be placed on the market. They also ensure that the presence of contaminants in food from all sources is covered since industrial activity is only one possible source. Maximum levels are set on the basis of risk assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority and competent authorities in the Member States ensure compliance with these levels.
