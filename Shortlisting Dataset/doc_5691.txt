WRITTEN QUESTION E-4990/07 by Glenis Willmott (PSE) to the Commission (11 October 2007) Subject: Human rights situation in Syria A constituent of mine has written to me regarding the cases of prisoners in Syria: Kamal al-Labwani, Michel Kilo, Anwar Bunni and Riad Saif, expressing his concern about the human rights situation in Syria, particularly in light of the pending Association Agreement with the EU. Can the Commission confirm it is aware of these cases and that they will be taken into account when it formalises any such agreements with Syria and that the Syrian authorities will encouraged to bring about the release of people imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression peacefully?
