WRITTEN QUESTION P-3592/06 by Frieda Brepoels (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (27 July 2006) Subject: European arrest warrant In Belgium a few weeks ago, on the basis of the European arrest warrant, a man was wrongfully arrested and surrendered to the Italian judicial authorities. The mistake, which had far-reaching consequences for the person concerned, happened because the Belgian courts had too little information at its disposal in order to sort out the matter. Many questions can be asked about European arrest warrant arrangements. Extradition decisions used to be taken by the government, with an advisory role for the judicial authorities, whereas now such decisions are virtually automatic and are taken solely by the judicial authorities. Extradition is taking place on the basis of very little information, and there is now virtually no scope to turn down requests. The defence has to make do with a summary description of the facts and a description of the offence concerned; other than that, it has no access to the case file. Naturally, prompt and efficient European cooperation on criminal law matters is important; but this cannot be a pretext for rolling back individual fundamental rights. This misunderstanding could have been prevented if better cooperation and information flow between the Belgian and Italian authorities had been possible, e.g. by releasing the entire case file or by means of a review of the merits of the case by the receiving state. Due attention should also be paid to the call by various EU Member States for the grounds for refusal to be extended. What is the Commission's opinion on this?
