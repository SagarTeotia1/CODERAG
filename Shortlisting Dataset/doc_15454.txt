development are set to fall in real terms; considers that a voluntary transfer of funds from direct agricultural support (CAP "first pillar") to rural development is not the appropriate means for remedying this situation; expresses in this connection strong reservations about the current Commission proposal regarding voluntary modulation of up to 20% of direct agricultural support to rural development; Heading 3a - freedom, security and justice 23. Points out that the area of Freedom, Justice and Security, in particular the promotion of fundamental rights, the definition of a common asylum and migration policy and the fight against terrorism and organised crime, is one of the Union’s key priorities; resolves accordingly to increase the resources allocated to this area, in particular to Eurojust, the sole body for judicial cooperation between the Member States in the criminal law field, the growing effectiveness of which must be stepped up still further; 24. Considers that integrated management of the Union’s external borders is one of the objectives currently requiring urgent, and greater, support; accordingly backs the increase in resources made available to the External Borders Fund; increases the resources made available to the FRONTEX Agency; restates its repeatedly made demand that Europol be placed on a Community footing in order both to increase its effectiveness and to step up the democratic and judicial oversight to which it must be subject; Heading 3b - citizenship 25.

Notes that the new legal framework for the EU's external actions also implies a new budget structure; welcomes in general the simplification of instruments and the new budget nomenclature proposed with it; welcomes also the presentation of a separate instrument on Human rights and Democracy, which requires a modification of the nomenclature of the PDB; cannot accept, however, that a number of the proposed changes reduce transparency for either sectors and/ or regions and will introduce necessary modifications; 28.
