They also consider that the absence of a Parliamentary right of initiative for the procedure to deal with serious breaches does not prevent Parliament from using its power of oversight to exert political pressure on the Council to act. MEPs say that the application of Article 7 should be based on the following principles: confidence in the democratic constitutional order of all the Member States and in the authority of the Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights; plurality: Article 7 proceedings should not be improperly used as an instrument of political opposition; equality in the treatment of all Member States; openness: all the procedures should be transparent, comprehensible and accessible to the public. MEPs believe it would be useful, after the renewal of both Parliament and the Commission in the coming months, to launch an inter-institutional discussion on the criteria and principles to be used in taking action under Article 7.

MEPs saw this new sentence as a clear contradiction to the judicial reforms started by the Turkish government and as symbolic of the gap between the Turkish judicial system and that of the EU. Parliament condemned the breaches of the rights of defence during the re-trial and hoped that the Turkish final Court of Appeal will quash the sentence. Parliament called for the immediate abolition of the State Security Courts and for an amnesty for all those imprisoned for their political views.

Drawn up by Véronique DE KEYSER (PES, B), the report aims to draw attention to the hidden costs of instability in the world, affecting more than just the direct victims of conflict. The report condemns in particular the denial of human rights often faced by disabled people. It also makes recommendations for a strengthening of EU human rights policy. Furthermore, it stresses the right for everyone to have access to public health provision, including the fight against AIDS, opposition to sexual violence and reproductive health care as a fundamental right. MEPs begin by condemning terrorism which is, they say, " one of the most serious common challenges facing the international community." They also stress that
