Answer given by Mr Prodi on behalf of the Commission (9 October 2003) The Commission does not award an operating grant to the Euronews television channel, but, as it does with many other radio or television channels, awards grants for actions, either for ad hoc projects or for the coproduction of television modules under a framework agreement covering the period 2001-2004. Grants for actions and framework agreements, awarded in accordance with the financial rules in force when they are signed, in no way restrict the editorial freedom of the beneficiary, who must, however, respect the image of the European institutions and the raison d'être and general objectives of the Union. In addition to these grants Parliament entered a sum of EUR 3 million on line B3-300 of the 2003 budget intended to finance the activities of Euronews in connection with the European institutions . To give effect to this request and on the basis of the Commission decision of 9 July 2003, Euronews was invited to present a programme of additional actions for which new grants may be awarded. This programme will be assessed by a selection committee in accordance with the arrangements laid down in the Financial Regulation Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities OJ L 248, 16.9.2002 . and its implementing rules Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, OJ L 357, 31.12.2002 . . On the basis of the report of this selection committee, the Commission will decide whether or not to award all or part of the amount earmarked on line B3-300 . If it does so, as generally applies with grants for actions, the editorial freedom of Euronews will be fully respected. The decision on continued cooperation with Euronews or any change in the arrangements will be taken in the light of the findings of an evaluation of the channel's Community-funded activities.
