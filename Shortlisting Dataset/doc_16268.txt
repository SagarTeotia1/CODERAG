- refugees (or protected persons) without access to employment not to be required to show that they have sickness insurance and sufficient "stable resources" to support themselves; - national integration conditions not to be imposed on such persons, given their vulnerability; - measures to ensure that a person who has been granted refugee status in one Member State cannot be deported to their country of origin from another Member State. In the Council, the unanimity required to adopt this legislation has not been reached because some Member States do not want beneficiaries of subsidiary protection to be included in the directive.

The report indicates that civil society has an essential role to play in promoting the emergence, definition, implementation, assessment and monitoring of drug policies. With its experience gained at grass-roots level, its innovative capacity and its potential in terms of the exchange of information and sound practices, civil society can bring significant added value to planned measures.

At the same time, MEPs in the committee call on the Commission and Member States to promote civil society initiatives, particularly those aiming to: i) reinforce the prevention of and information on the risks associated with drug use; ii) treat drug addicts in prison; iii) establish special preventive procedures in “at-risk” metropolitan areas; iv) organise, with the cooperation of parents’, students’ and teachers’ organisations, awareness and prevention campaigns on drugs and their harmful effects on health; v) implement damage-reduction policies through direct contact with people in the street and in neighbourhoods; vi) establish reintegration projects for street children and disadvantaged families. Civil Society – the external dimension : MEPs call for a strengthening of the external dimension of the EU’s drug strategy in order to have a sustainable impact on drug-producing countries.
