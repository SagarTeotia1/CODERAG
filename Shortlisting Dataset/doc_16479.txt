organisation" regulation. Previously there were twenty-one different market organisation regimes, making the CAP unnecessarily complex. The latest reforms do not change any of the market arrangements but will simplify the regime and make it more transparent. The report on this subject was drafted for Parliament's Agriculture Committee by its chair, Neil Parish (EPP-ED, UK), who said "We have a long way to go before we truly succeed in making the CAP transparent and simple, but this latest addition of wine follows recent additions of fruit and vegetables, and will certainly contribute to making the whole regime far more transparent for farmers."

The aim is to encourage healthier eating habits in children and combat the obesity epidemic. MEPs would like to see more funding for the programme and they also suggest giving priority to local seasonal produce. In the European Union around 22 million children are overweight and more than 5 million are obese, mainly owing to excessive consumption of fatty, sweet or salty food. The World Health Organisation recommends consumption of at least 400g of fruit and vegetables per day for children under the age of 11. Parliament has already - on 25 September - adopted an own-initiative report on the fight against obesity, in which it called for fruit and vegetables to be stocked in vending machines in schools and for school curricula to include information on balanced diets. How much funding is needed? When the fruit and vegetable sector of the CAP was reformed last year, the European Parliament and the Member States called for a programme to be set up for distributing fruit and vegetables in schools to encourage children to eat more healthily. The European Commission has proposed a budget of €90 million for this programme for the school year 2009-2010. This budget is not enough, argue MEPs: it is equivalent to giving every child aged 6 to 10 one piece of fruit a week for 30 weeks. The Agriculture Committee's report calls for the Community contribution to be increased to €500 million for the year in question. However, the rapporteur, Niels Busk (ALDE, DK), believes this is unrealistic and intends to table an amendment calling for a figure of €360 million. Preference for fresh produce, grown in Europe The draft report also calls for the practical arrangements for the programme to be clarified. MEPs say it should cover only fruit
