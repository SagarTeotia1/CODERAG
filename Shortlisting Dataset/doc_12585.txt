Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (23 April 2010) All relevant questions concerning EU‑Cuba relations concerning respect for human rights are discussed within the framework of the EU‑Cuba political dialogue. The Commission underlines that the EU policy towards Cuba, insofar that is part of the CFSP, is defined and implemented by the Council on the basis of the general guidelines and strategic lines defined by the European Council. It will be for the Council to assess in June 2010, on the occasion of the evaluation of the 1996 Common Position, the results of the political dialogue and the future of the relations between the EU and Cuba.
