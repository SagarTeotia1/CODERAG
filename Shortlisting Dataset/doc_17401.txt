the EFSA assessment, the Commission concluded that it was appropriate to maintain the current legislative approach. This does not prevent producers to provide consumers with information on the nature of the feed via voluntary labelling schemes provided that they respect the current rules on GM labelling and traceability, and they are not misleading. In the meantime a specific question on this issue has been introduced as a part of the evaluation of the legislative framework on GM food and feed and that will be finalised in June 2010. The Commission will analyse the outcome of this evaluation and will ensure appropriate follow-up.
