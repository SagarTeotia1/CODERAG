WRITTEN QUESTION E-0261/07 by Tokia Saïfi (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (31 January 2007) Subject: Setting up the European Institute of Technology As part of the mid‑term review of the Lisbon Strategy on growth and jobs, the Commission made a proposal to the Council on setting up a European Institute of Technology (EIT) with the aim of creating a new centre of excellence in higher education, research and development within the European Union. In its communication of February 2006, the Commission therefore set to work by outlining the main goals of the institute. It submitted these to the Council for consideration. The Commission was then due to bring forward a formal proposal before the end of 2006 so that the legislation establishing the EIT could be adopted in 2008, and so that the executive committee could be appointed in 2009. What are the Commission’s formal proposals that should have been brought forward at the end of 2006? Where will the EIT be situated?
