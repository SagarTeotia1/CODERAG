Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (23 December 2004) According to the Commission Autumn 2004 forecasts, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated at 3.8% in 2004. For 2005, real GDP is forecasted to grow at 3.3%. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) will increase by 2.9% in 2004. Therefore, the HICP inflation rate is expected to decline compared with the figure recorded in 2003 (3.5%). For 2005, at 2.9%, the HICP inflation rate is projected to remain almost unchanged with respect to 2004. Finally, the general government deficit is estimated to reach 5.5% of GDP in 2004 and 3.6% of GDP in 2005. There are no quarterly figures for the general government deficit. Figures for HICP are only calculated on a monthly or annual basis. The Greek statistical services publish quarterly figures of GDP and some of its components. According to Eurostat, on a year-on-year basis (compared to the same quarters of 2003), GDP grew by 4.0% and 3.9% in the first and second quarters of 2004, respectively. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP grew at 2.9% in the first quarter of 2004 (compared with the fourth quarter of 2003), and fell by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2004 (compared with the first quarter of 2004). Quarterly GDP data for the third quarter of 2004 is not available yet. Monthly figures available for HICP up to September 2004 are fully in line with the Commission forecast of 2.9% for the inflation rate in 2004. At the end of March 2004 the HICP declined to 2.9% from 3.9% in March 2003.
