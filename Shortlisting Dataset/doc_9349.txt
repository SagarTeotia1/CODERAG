the available tools to contribute to this objective and, if appropriate, the Member-States had the possibility to select this measure among others for their PoM. The Member States had to adopt their River Basin Management Plans (RBMP), including the PoM, by 2009. The Commission is currently assessing the quality of these reported plans in order to issue an implementation report at the end of 2012. The Commission has brought an action before the Court of Justice of the European Union against Denmark for failure to adopt and report its RBMPs to the Commission. The Commission is aware of the significant role of agriculture in this Member State as a pressure on water and will carefully assess Denmark's ability to comply with the WFD objectives in the agriculture context. However, prior to the finalisation of the Danish plans and the assessment of these by the Commission, and subsequently the publication of the Commission's implementation report, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the implementation of the WFD in Denmark.
