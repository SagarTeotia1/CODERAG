second question, the Commission would like to stress that it does not intend to put an end to prices subsidies for electricity produced from renewable energy sources in Luxembourg. According to Council Directive 2001/77/EC, Luxembourg is obliged to introduce such a national support scheme. At present the Commission is only verifying whether the Luxembourg system results in over-compensation for producers of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. Should such overcompensation exist, the Commission would oblige Luxembourg to change the support mechanism to avoid any such overcompensation.
