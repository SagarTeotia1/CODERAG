WRITTEN QUESTION E-0084/10 by David Casa (PPE) to the Commission (21 January 2010) Subject: Rubble walls Rubble walls are found in abundance in the Maltese countryside. These walls have existed for many years, lining country lanes as well as dividing fields from each other, and on different levels in terraced fields. They also prevent soil erosion, in addition to the obvious aesthetic rural feel they give wherever they are found. One could say that they form an integral part of the Maltese countryside. After storms, many rubble walls are found to be damaged, due to the pressure of wet soils acting on them. The reconstruction of these walls is extremely labour/intensive as all the stones used are totally irregular, and the technique is the same one used hundreds of years ago. In this regard, would the Commission be prepared to allocate funding for the maintenance of all the country lanes and rubble walls that are not in a good state?
