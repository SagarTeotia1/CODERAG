WRITTEN QUESTION E-2833/07 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (5 June 2007) Subject: Exposure of the population to electromagnetic radiation produced by high-voltage facilities in Patraix (Valencia, Spain) The company Iberdrola has an electricity sub-station of between 200 000 and 20 000 volts in Patraix (Valencia, Spain). The sub-station is located only a few metres away from housing in a densely populated area (27 000 inhabitants, including 3 000 children), as well as a number of schools and other educational establishments. A large number of independent scientific studies link various serious illnesses, especially among children and the elderly, to exposure to the electromagnetic radiation produced by high-voltage power facilities such as Iberdrola's electricity sub-station in Patraix. In view of the clear evidence of the serious impact on the health of the population of exposure to the electromagnetic fields generated by the plant and the fact that the precautionary prinicple is not being applied, can the Commission say: 1. whether it is already aware of the existence of Iberdrola's electricity sub-station in Patraix (Valencia, Spain); 2. what emergency safety measures it envisages adopting pending a rigorous evaluation of the viability of Iberdrola's electricity sub-station in Patraix (Valencia, Spain); 3. what view it takes of the fact that the sub-station is located only a few metres away from housing in a densely populated area and a number of schools and other educational establishments; 4. whether it does not consider that Iberdrola's electricity sub-station should be moved outside the town centre?
