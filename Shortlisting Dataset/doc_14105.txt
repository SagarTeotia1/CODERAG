INTA Accession of Russia to the WTO The Committee will hear a presentation by the Commission on state of play on WTO accessions at its meeting on 11 October. The question remains whether the WTO Geneva Ministerial Conference in December will have draft Decision on the Accession of Russia on its agenda. Investment measures in automotive sector, meat import quotas as well as complicated relations with Georgia are issues to be resolved by then. WTO_Russia@European Parliament 20110922CAN27319
