transparent and avoid a disproportionate reaction to the American situation; 65. Notes the failure of the Member States to demonstrate solidarity, with regard to increasing the amount of gas available to the affected Member States during the recent gas crisis between Ukraine and Russia; urges the Council and the Commission to create a solidarity mechanism, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, which would allow the EU to act efficiently, swiftly and coherently in crisis situations caused by disruption of supply, damage to critical infrastructure or any other such event; 66. Welcomes, in the light of the above-mentioned gas crisis that afflicted the Union's territory, the Commission's intention to improve the framework of Council Directive 2004/67/EC of 26 April 2004 concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply OJ L 127, 29.4.2004, p. 92. and calls on the Commission to propose amendments to this Directive before the end of 2009 along the lines proposed in its above mentioned Communication COM(2008)0769 ; 67. Stresses that the key elements of the revision of Council Directive 2004/67/EC should contain mandatory and effective national and EU emergency action plans, which among other things define a common declaration of an emergency situation, allocation of available supplies and infrastructure capacity among the affected States, coordinated dispatching, activation of emergency measures in unaffected or less affected States in order to increase the amount of gas available to the affected markets using all means possible, including, among others, interruptible contracts, fuel switching, storage withdrawal and supply flexibilities for example; considers that it is essential to improve the functioning of the market through transparency and increase the availability of gas in the market; calls on the European Union and its Member States to develop gas storage with fast-release capacity; 68. Proposes that information technologies should be used better for total or partial cut-offs in the event of a crisis, and considers, for this purpose, that under the supervision of the regulator, a system capable of reducing consumption in response to a collective decision could be introduced; Energy efficiency 69. Considers that improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020 is the priority in contributing to sustainable development and competitiveness objectives and is also the most effective and cost-efficient way of improving energy security; calls therefore on the Commission and Member States immediately to adopt a legally binding energy efficiency target of at least 20% by 2020; calls on the Commission and Member States to step up awareness campaigns and make practical information available concerning the energy efficiency solutions to be adopted and also to promote energy education and training programmes in schools and universities throughout the Union; 70. Stresses the importance of rigorous and timely implementation and enforcement of energy savings and energy efficiency legislation by Member States and the Commission; stresses the importance of adopting mandatory public procurement measures at the Community and national levels in order to stimulate the demand for innovative products and services that will enhance energy efficiency; calls therefore for an ambitious approach in forthcoming legislation relating to energy savings and energy efficiency (in
