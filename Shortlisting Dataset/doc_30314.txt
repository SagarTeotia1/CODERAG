Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) The Commission is preparing a number of measures implementing Directive 2011/24/EU Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on the application of patient rights in cross-border healthcare, [2011] OJ L 88/45. , one of them being on the establishment of a voluntary Health Technology Assessment (HTA) network (Article 15). Although the network consists of HTA bodies designated by the Member States, the abovementioned Directive indicates that the network may receive Union support to facilitate the consultation of stakeholders on the work of the network. The Joint Action on HTA (2010-2012), a project co-financed by the Commission through the Health Programme and bringing together all major HTA bodies in the Member States, has established a Stakeholder Forum with the view to consulting healthcare industry, patients and consumers, health professionals and health insurers/payers. The model thus developed for the Stakeholder Forum could serve as a basis for future stakeholder consultations within the HTA network. However, further discussion with both Member States and other stakeholders are necessary before more specific information on how future patient consultations will take place can be provided. In its proposal for a new Health for Growth programme Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a Health for Growth Programme, the third multi-annual programme of EU action in the field of health for the period 2014-2020, COM(2011) 709 final of 9.11.2011. , the Commission proposed that actions in the field of HTA should be eligible for funding. Such funding could also include support to facilitate the consultation of stakeholders in the HTA network's activities.
