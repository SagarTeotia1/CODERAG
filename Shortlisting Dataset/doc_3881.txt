WRITTEN QUESTION E-0459/08 by Joseph Muscat (PSE) to the Commission (5 February 2008) Subject: Healthcare charges Tokuda, a private Japanese-owned hospital based in Sofia, Bulgaria, is reportedly charging different prices for Bulgarian citizens and non-Bulgarian citizens. A Maltese national recently visited the hospital for a consultation and was charged double the price a Bulgarian is charged for the same service. When asked for an explanation of this discrepancy in prices, the management responded that Bulgarian citizens are given a 50 % discount on the prices which citizens of all other countries pay. The hospital openly maintains a double-pricing policy and it clearly discriminates between its patients on the basis of nationality. EU citizens of other countries are denied the right to be treated the same as the locals in this EU member country when using the services of this hospital. Will the Commission investigate this issue with the competent authorities?
