WRITTEN QUESTION E-4286/05 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (18 November 2005) Subject: Intellectual property rights With reference to the Commission's proposal on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights (COM(2005)276 final), could the Commission detail the following: — On what basis can it justify its reference to Article 17(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as the direct objective of this initiative? How is it that the Charter of Fundamental Rights can still be referred to as justification for a legislative proposal when the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which provided for the existence of the Charter, has been rejected? — Whilst making reference to the subsidiarity principle, Point 4 of the proposal appears to directly undermine this principle by making the presumption that the objectives of the directive cannot be achieved by Member States acting alone. Please advise as to whether Member States have even been allowed to try to achieve the objectives on an individual basis.
