WRITTEN QUESTION E-5917/07 by Jörg Leichtfried (PSE) to the Commission (29 November 2007) Subject: Concession permits for bus companies On European roads it is not uncommon for bus operators to be allowed to transport goods without a valid concession permit. A complaint has been made by an Austrian bus operator, for instance, whose firm had to close down because it could no longer withstand the price pressure from illegal bus operators on Austrian roads. In this instance, concession permits have been sold on at cut-price rates by a Serbian transport firm to unauthorised operators running one to three buses. Those operators are not properly trained and, furthermore, some have previous convictions, demonstrating that they would never obtain a concession permit legally. The Serbian firm Maxibus operates four buses seven days a week on each route, sometimes even twice a day, making about 280 return journeys. With four buses that is simply not possible. In addition, this questionable firm's drivers have also committed theft in Salzburg, causing losses already totalling EUR 3 million. 1. Has the Commission already been informed that respectable bus companies are having to close down because they can no longer withstand the price pressure in their industry from unlicensed cut-price operators? 2. Will the Commission take steps to ensure that border controls are improved and that unlicensed firms are no longer allowed to operate on European roads? 3. What action can be taken in the specific case referred to? Should the Austrian authorities step up border controls? Would that be compatible with European law?
