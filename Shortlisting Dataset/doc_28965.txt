WRITTEN QUESTION E-6112/09 by Mario Borghezio (EFD) to the Council (7 December 2009) Subject: Need for the EU to take action to stop oil price speculation The oil market, where there is a structural imbalance between supply and demand, is currently being disrupted not only by geo-political factors but also by a huge surge in speculation, which is perhaps even more serious and dangerous. The scale of this speculation is such that total oil production no longer bears any relation to the volume of futures being traded, which is now equivalent to an oil production level (600 million barrels per day) seven times greater than actual oil production (88 million barrels). It is quite likely that, as a result of financial speculation of this kind, the price of crude could not only return to the mid‑2008 level (USD 147) but even reach USD 200-250, as predicted at that time by Goldman Sachs and Gazprom. Would the Council state what urgent measures it intends to take to prevent the extremely serious impact continued oil price speculation would have on the economic revival of the EU and its Member States?
