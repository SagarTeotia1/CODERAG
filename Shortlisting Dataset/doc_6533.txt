Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (29 September 2011) The Commission is tracking very closely the impact of new technologies on healthcare delivery. The type of results in pilots, such as the one described in Kenya, demonstrate that the use of SMS as a communication tool in the health arena may have significant potential. The Commission support to the health sectors of partner countries is principally through the strengthening of health systems and providing the necessary resources for development and implementation of comprehensive and evidence-based national strategies, using its range of aid instruments. It is then the decision of the national government whether to institutionalise such technology choices in policy and practice. Should the country make this choice then the Commission would fully support implementation, so far as it is engaged in the sector. The Kenya example also highlights the importance of high-quality applied research taken forward by national institutions such as KEMRI (Kenya Medical Research Institute). The Commission supports such national research efforts in partner countries through projects such as ‘Supporting the use of research evidence for policy in African health systems’ and ‘Africa regional capacity development for health systems and service research’ managed by Directorate-General Research.
