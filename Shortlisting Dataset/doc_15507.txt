other EP committees. As per paragraph 23 of the mandate report, he considers that a rationalisation and concentration of proposals should be an objective for the 2007 budget. Administrative resources 12. In parallel with the DB, the Council adopted a unilateral declaration on administrative resources. This focused on posts in the Commission, to the effect that half of the posts which would become vacant through retirements in 2007 - some 200 posts - should be deleted in the 2008 budget. The declaration also sought the deletion of a further 500 posts between 2008 and 2010 linked to the concentration of programmes under the new MFF. The rapporteur cannot endorse such a position at this stage. He intends to make proposals in the EP first reading based on the report on the real medium-term staff needs that the Commission was asked to prepare by 1 September in the mandate report for the first conciliation. He emphasises the need for the redeployment of staff in the Commission to priority areas and he also considers staffing levels in the agencies to be a relevant issue in this context. Changes in the draft budget by MFF heading 13. The remainder of this section of the working document presents the main changes in the PDB by MFF heading. The summary figures per heading, including changes to overall figures and margins, are presented in tables 1 and 2 above. Heading 1a - competitiveness for growth and employment 14. The DB reduces the payments on budget line 09 04 03 02 by € 48 million on the completion of the 6th Framework Programme for Research in the field of Information society and media. The payments for Security and Space Research (budget line 02 04 01) are reduced by € 50 million. The payment appropriations for the TEN projects of common interest are reduced by € 30 million (this reduction concerns the completion of existing trans-European transport network, TEN-energy are not concerned). The Council placed € 15 million in reserve pending the adoption of a legal basis for the International Fund for Ireland. 15. As noted above, the DB includes two pilot projects on "knowledge triangle" (budget line 02 02 09) and on "energy security - promotion of EU self-efficiency in renewable energy sources, in particular biofuels" (budget line 06 04 07). In parallel, the DB reduces payments for the Intelligent energy-Europe programme (2003-2006) by € 10 million. This is somewhat surprising in that this programme deals with energy security by promoting the use of renewable energy including biofuels (see budget line 06 04 01). This suggests that these pilot projects may not cover new activities for which no current budget line exists. Heading 1b - cohesion for growth and employment 16. The DB does not change the commitment appropriations in the PDB. Payment appropriations have been reduced by EUR 425 million: especially the budget lines relating to the completion of the 2000-2006 programmes (- € 355 million, of which € 220 million were cut in payments for the completion of the European Social Fund - objective 3 - budget
