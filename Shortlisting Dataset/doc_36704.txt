the Commission was working to harmonise its timetable on capital requirements with that of the G20. Vicky Ford (ECR, UK) expressed dismay at the low priority the Commission was giving to the problem of toxic assets. "We cannot wait five years after Lehman to tackle toxic assets, the very assets which caused the crisis" she said. Wolf Klinz (ALDE, DE) displayed some scepticism towards the Commissioner's comments on a European bailout fund for banks, arguing that such a fund would never be financed to the levels which would make it effective. Over the next eight months the EP's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will be scrutinising a whole raft of Commission proposals aimed at better regulating the financial system. Most of the proposals will fall under the decision-making process where the Parliament shares equal power with the Council.
