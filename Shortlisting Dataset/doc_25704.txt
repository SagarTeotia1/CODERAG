WRITTEN QUESTION E-2863/09 by Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (22 April 2009) Subject: Classification of professional coastal fishermen on the basis of a minimum catch limit in kilos The Republic of Cyprus has classified professional coastal fishermen in special categories on the basis of the minimum limit for catches (in kilos) and fishing outings, with a minimum threshold of 1 500 kilos for 150 outings for category A and 1 200 kilos for 120 outings for category B. Furthermore, the Republic of Cyprus has made it compulsory, under these regulations, for coastal fishermen to renew their professional licence every year. Given the attempt by the European Union to restrict intensive fishing, will the Commission say whether the above measure setting a minimum catch limit for coastal fishing adopted by the Republic of Cyprus is contrary to EU efforts, and also whether it is reasonable and necessary, on the basis of these criteria, to require coastal fishermen to renew their professional licences every year?
