Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (10 April 2007) The Commission is aware of the situation related to the spillage from the Sierra Nava vessel in Algeciras Bay and its possible effects on the Natura 2000 ES0000337 ‘Estrecho’ Clarification: according to available information, the site quoted by the Honourable Members of the Parliament as ES 6120012 ‘Frente Litoral del Estrecho de Gibraltar’ refers to a first proposal that has finally been adopted as site of Community importance and designated as special protected area under the denomination ES0000337 ‘Estrecho’. designated as a special protected area under the provisions of the ‘Birds Directive’ 79/409/EEC Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. and included as a site of Community importance under the provisions of the ‘Habitats Directive’ 92/43/EEC Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. . According to the information available, the Sierra Nava refrigerated vessel ran aground on the 28 January 2007 off a beach of the Municipality of Algeciras (Spain) known as ‘Getares’ beach. The vessel contained 350 tons of light fuel in four different reservoirs, one of which might have caused the spill. The oil spill is limited to about one kilometre of the beach and the emergency work succeeded in recovering most of the fuel still contained in the reservoirs. This first emergency phase ended the 21 February 2007. Faced with the oil spill, the Spanish authorities are responsible for taking the necessary steps to avoid environmental damage to the features for which the abovementioned site of Community importance has been designated, as far as this disturbance would be significant. This is in accordance to Article 6(2) of the ‘Habitats Directive’. According to available information, cleaning measures are still ongoing. It is not possible to make a clear assessment of the significance of the damage at this stage. However, it seems that the impact from this oil spill is likely to be rather limited. Therefore, an infringement of Community law cannot be acknowledged at present. However, the Commission will follow closely the evolution of this case.
