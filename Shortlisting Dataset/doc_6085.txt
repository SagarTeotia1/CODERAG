ORAL QUESTION H-0416/08 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Brian Crowley to the Commission Subject: Safety tonnage application On 13 June 2006, the Court of First Instance ruled in favour of 20 Irish applications seeking safety tonnage, which annuls Commission Decision 2003/245/EC of 4 April 2003 for 20 safety tonnage applications. The Court found that the Commission had used criteria not provided for in the rules (i.e. vessels have to be at least 5 years old before being eligible to apply for safety tonnage) and that it had exceeded its power. All the safety tonnage applications were submitted to the Commission before 31 December 2001, as required under Council Decision 97/413/EC (see Article 4(2)) The Court found that the Commission had not applied this article correctly in refusing the safety tonnage application for these individuals. Could the Commission comment on why this decision was not appealed and why the successful applicants are still awaiting an answer from the Commission, almost two years later, on how it intends to comply with the Court ruling?
