by providing assistance to those affected by such weapons, including economic assistance such as land clearance and social assistance such as medical support; L. whereas EU citizens, civilian and military members of peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, have been and will continue to become victims of such weapons, in humanitarian civilian and military missions and potentially under future ESDP missions, M. whereas targeting of civilians in any conflict with any weapon is contrary to the international humanitarian law of the ICC, in particular in case of a high number of civilian casualties, N. whereas for the EU, in developing its ESDP and deploying armed forces, it is vital to uphold international humanitarian law and arms control to the highest standards, 1. Calls on the EU and its Member States to review and monitor the design and development of weapons, ensuring that they are in line with the appropriate international law to meet the highest international standards against technical misuse, misdeployment, mistargeting and malfunction; calls for the conclusions of this review and monitoring process to be made public; 2. Calls on the EU and its Member States, as well as on NATO and its non-EU member states, to make a public declaration and guarantee that they will not use weapons or weapons systems that have been banned or are deemed to be illegal under international law in present or future armed conflicts; 3. Calls on the EU and the EU Member States and applicant states to fully support the Group of Governmental Experts in negotiating a new or amended protocol within the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons to tackle the issue of Explosive Remnants of War, in particular so as to achieve benchmarks for speedy assistance to affected victims; 4. Calls on the EU to fully support the Commission's programmes in the area of mine clearance; emphasises that these programmes should be extended to the broader area of explosive remnants of war; invites the Commission to make a statement as to how this could be done; 5. Invites the Commission to issue a communication on this issue, outlining in detail how it is strengthening its efforts in favour of projects assisting the victims of anti-personnel mines or unexploded ordnance (primary care or social and economic reintegration projects) and by what means it is encouraging third countries and non-state actors that control parts of a country which are mine-affected to set up a policy towards these victims; 6. Calls on the Commission, in order to support the efforts in Geneva with the States Parties to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons, to issue a communication on its assessment of priorities and best practice which might be usefully incorporated into any international legal efforts to address the issue of unexploded ordnance; 7. Calls on the EU to take all necessary steps to promote the universalisation of the 1997 Ottawa Treaty and the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons, in particular towards EU Member States, applicant countries and third countries, especially the ACP countries and the USA; urges these states to sign, ratify and implement these treaties;
