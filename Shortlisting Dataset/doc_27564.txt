Question for written answer E-009411/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (20 October 2011) Subject: Alcoholic drinks’ producers versus pregnant women The children of mothers who consumed alcohol during pregnancy are regularly diagnosed as having foetal alcohol syndrome, which causes retarded growth, neurological damage, hyperactivity, autism, low IQ, social skill disorders and facial abnormalities. According to experts, the problem of women consuming alcohol during pregnancy could be partly resolved by better means of communication. In particular, it is essential to point out that there is no acceptable or safe limit. Many Member States are, however, doing nothing on this front. According to WHO data, alcohol is responsible for 2 to 3 million deaths each year, which puts it in second place behind tobacco amongst the legal substances that endanger human life and health. Since alcohol control policy is a matter for the Member States, how does the Commission propose to tackle the issue at EU‑wide level?
