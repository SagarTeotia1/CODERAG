WRITTEN QUESTION P-1026/06 by Roberto Musacchio (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (16 March 2006) Subject: Recognition of service at the Italian National Research Council and social security and pension rights In 1980 and 1982 the Italian National Research Council (CNR), a public body, employed 44 graduates on the basis of a training contract in accordance with Articles 26 and 26a of Law No 285/77. They were incorrectly referred to as ‘assegnisti’ (recipients of a fixed-rate stipend) because of the payment method used at the time, which was extended until 1990, when they became permanent members of the CNR’s staff on a list in accordance with Law No 14 of 18 January 1989. First the CNR, and then the Regional Administrative Court and the Supreme Administrative Court on several occasions refused to recognise their years of service and their social security and pension rights, although the training period had obviously been repeatedly renewed without any breaks and was thus equivalent to a proper employment contract. This was, moreover, recognised by Article 4 of Law No 14 of 18 January 1989, which decreed that ‘assegnisti’ who had not passed the relevant examination should cease to be employed by the civil service department concerned — which was not the case of the 44 graduate research assistants. The failure to apply Article 26c of Law No 33 of 29 February 1980 with regard to the legal and financial recognition of the terms of employment, which penalised and discriminated against these research assistants as regards the free movement of workers in the European Community, was reported to the Commission (2005/4022, SG(2004) A/12490/3), as evidence of Italy’s infringement of Articles 39 and 42, as well as 136, 137, 140, 149 and 150 of the Treaty. By note No 001196 of 27.1.2005 the Commission DG for Employment, Directorate E, expressed the view that there had been no infringement of freedom of movement because the case was an internal, rather than a transnational matter. However, as the 44 researchers replied on 17 February 2005, the recognition of such rights is an integral part of the Community free market without internal frontiers, in which Community law, taking precedence over national law, applies to subjective legal positions, which may be upheld by any Community citizen in any manner and at any time. Can the Commission say whether it does not consider the reply from the DG for Employment and the case of the 44 CNR researchers to be inconsistent and incompatible with the dictates of a single market, in which respect for workers’ rights should be safeguarded by recognising, without discrimination, that these researchers are entitled to enjoy the same rights as their EU colleagues?
