that targets simultaneously all the related policy areas and makes immediate intervention possible in ghetto areas struggling with serious structural disadvantages; 15. Stresses that anti-discrimination measures alone are insufficient as a means of facilitating the social inclusion of Roma, but that a concerted Community effort on a firm legal basis is needed in order to coordinate measures by institutional and societal stakeholders and to force the parties concerned to fulfil their own pledges, accepting thereby also the need for a clear legislative commitment and credible budgetary appropriations; 16. Calls on the Council to adopt a common position on structural and pre-accession funding policy, reflecting European political commitment to fully harness the opportunities of these funds to promote Roma inclusion and to ensure that the Common Basic Principles on Roma Inclusion are fully taken into account in any revisions of operational programmes and resource allocation procedures, including priorities for the planning period 2014-2020; urges the Commission to analyse and evaluate the social effect of the investments of the pre-accession and structural funds targeting Roma inclusion to date, to draw the consequences and to devise new strategies and rules if this is considered necessary in this field; 17. Stresses that the candidate countries must be involved in the European‑level pursuit of Roma integration as soon as possible, since accession negotiations grant an unparalleled opportunity to trigger a substantial shift in governmental attitudes towards Roma; 18. Highlights the precarious situation of many Roma who, in exercising their freedom of movement within the Union, have migrated within the EU; stresses that any measures taken in respect of these groups must adhere to European standards and legislation, and calls on the European Commission and the Member States to establish whether there is a need for a coordinated European approach; 19. Stresses the importance of involving local authorities in ensuring effective implementation of efforts to promote Roma inclusion and combat discrimination; requests the European Commission to develop recommendations for the Member States with a view to encouraging local authorities to make better use of structural funding opportunities to promote Roma inclusion, including the objective monitoring of project implementation; 20. Emphasises the importance of Community‑level organisations of Roma as a key means of ensuring the success of social inclusion policies, as well as the need to involve Roma representatives in all the initiatives aimed at promoting their rights and the inclusion of their communities; considers that there is a need for long‑term strategies to build the professional and organisational capacity of Roma and to develop Roma human resources as a horizontal priority; stresses that the political independence and empowerment of Roma self-organisation in terms of financial, academic and human resources is vital in accelerating the social inclusion of Roma; 21. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the to the Council, the Commission, the governments and the parliaments of the Member States and the candidate countries, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
