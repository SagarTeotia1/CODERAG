Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (7 May 2008) The Commission recalls its firm condemnation and rejection of any manifestation of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia, regardless of whom they come from, as these phenomena are incompatible with the values and principles which the European Union is founded upon. As regards the monitoring of anti-Semitic incidents, the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), building on the work of the former European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), continues to make available on its Internet site (www.fra.europa.eu) data on anti-Semitism in the EU. As regards specific initiatives, the EU, within the remit of its competence as defined by the Treaties, has already adopted a number of measures aiming at prevening anti-Semitic incidents, such as the anti-discrimination directives (notably Directive 2000/43/EC Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, OJ L 180, 19.7.2000. which prohibits race and ethnic origin discrimination), banning hate speech on European TV Stations (Article 22 of the ‘TV without Borders Directive’ Directive 2007/65/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 amending Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, OJ L 332, 18.12.2007. ), providing financial support to civil society and organising awareness-raising activities. The Council has also reached a political agreement on the framework Decision on racism and xenophobia which criminalises intentional conduct such as incitation to violence or hatred towards a group of people, or a person belonging to a group, defined on the basis of race, colour, descent, religion or belief, national or ethnic origin, as well as the public condoning, denial or gross trivialisation of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The unfortunate episode referred to by the Honourable Member only reinforces the Commission's determination to ensure the thorough implementation of already adopted measures and the completion of the legal framework within the remit of EU competence.
