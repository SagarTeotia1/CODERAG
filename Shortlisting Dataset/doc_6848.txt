ORAL QUESTION O-0035/02 pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure by Francis Wurtz , on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group to the Commission Subject: European Community shipbuilding sector In November 2001, the European Parliament approved the Commission proposal to introduce a temporary protection mechanism, in the form of aid to European shipyards, in response to the dumping practised by South Korea in particular. Six months after its adoption, this regulation is still not being applied. Does the Commission finally intend to adopt this regulation and apply it swiftly so as to protect European shipyards against unfair competition from third countries? Given the current world market conditions, does it not also think that the OECD agreement of December 1994 should be reviewed?
