and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws Text with EEA relevance, OJ L 337, 18.12.2009. ). Regarding the role of Parliament on ACTA, the Commission has shared with Parliament all relevant Commission documents that have been shared with the Member States through the 133 Committee (now ‘Trade Policy Committee’). It kept Parliament informed since before the launch of negotiations, particularly via the INTA Committee. Former Commissioners for Trade and the Director-General for Trade have addressed this issue several times in the last three years. The Commission will obviously continue these procedures and remains open to discuss any improvement in the flow of information.
