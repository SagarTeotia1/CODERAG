Question for written answer E-010295/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE) (9 December 2010) Subject: Problems and prospects of the single electricity market On 15 November 2010, the Commission published the findings of research http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/1507&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en on the extent to which European citizens enjoy the benefits of the deregulation of the electricity market. According to these findings, this market is one of the markets from which consumers benefit least. One major reason is the lack of consumer information about the most advantageous offers of electricity providers and the benefits of market deregulation. In view of the above, will the Commission say: What is the reason for the lack of information? Does it not agree that the failure to inform consumers about the benefits is the result of the high degree of market concentration in some Member States? Is it possible to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the specific measures adopted so far with a view to informing consumers about the benefits of energy policy? What are the lessons to be drawn from good practices? Are there any specific objectives that will accompany the new proposals and measures?
