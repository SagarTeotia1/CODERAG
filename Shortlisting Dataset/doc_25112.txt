WRITTEN QUESTION E-6674/09 by David Casa (PPE) to the Commission (13 January 2010) Subject: Marine ecosystems With the effects of the increase in greenhouse gases as well as the effects of global warming, sometimes many tend to overlook the fact that ecosystems are also being affected, not necessarily by the consequences mentioned above. Various studies have shown that certain species are on the verge of extinction, due to the continuous pollution that started in the industrial revolution and has been increasing ever since. Apart from the pollution of our seas and oceans, we also have the unfortunate, but relatively frequent, oil spillages. All these factors have brought certain species that were already listed as endangered to the verge of extinction. What studies is the Commission planning with regard to this matter? Would the Commission be prepared to propose legislation with the underlying principle being to give harsher penalties to those involved in so-called accidents, which essentially occur due to gross negligence and which are having dire consequences on our marine ecosystems?
