Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2011) Isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane are not covered by Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases. Anaesthetic gases which fulfill the definition of medicinal products are, however, covered by the same requirements that apply to any other medicinal products. In this context, these products need to receive a marketing authorisation before they may be placed on the market in the EU Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directives 2001/82/EC and 2001/83/EC. and the application to receive such authorisation shall be accompanied by: — the evaluation of the potential environmental risks posed by the medicinal product. This impact shall be assessed and, on a case-by-case basis, specific arrangements to limit risks shall be envisaged; — reasons for any necessary, precautionary and safety measures to be taken for the storage of the medicinal product, its administration to patients and for the disposal of waste products, together with an indication of potential risks presented by the medicinal product for the environment. Whilst the scale of isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane emissions is relatively small Following recent estimates, the annual climate impact of global emissions of inhaled anaesthetics is equivalent to 4.4 million tonnes of CO 2 , which represents less than 0.01% of global greenhouse gas emissions. , the EU's position as regards the basket of greenhouse gases included in the post-2012 regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) considers expanding the basket with certain hydrofluoroethers, including isoflurane and desflurane. This would ensure that isoflurane and desflurane are covered by the UNFCCC monitoring and reporting obligations and included in quantitative emission reduction targets.
