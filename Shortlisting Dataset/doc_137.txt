Answer given by Mrs Hübner on behalf of the Commission (26 October 2005) As regards the Honourable Member's written question on the audit findings: — there were no irregularities in connection with the implementation of Cohesion Fund legislation, except for non-respect of publicity requirements (see below); the airport meets Community norms; — the recalculation of the total cost of the elements co-financed by the Cohesion Fund led to a slight reduction of the Cohesion Fund co-financing, which resulted in a financial correction of EUR 7940214 ; — there was a failure to comply with publicity and information provisions, leading to a financial correction of EUR 4841196 . The Greek authorities expressed their disagreement with the audit conclusions. A financial correction procedure was launched by Commission decision C(2005)3243. of 1 September 2005. The overall correction decided is EUR 12781410 and will be recovered by reimbursement.
