) See Point 28 of the resolution. 5. Traditionally, the EU's innovation policy is linked to research. There will be a new programme (the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme - CIP) in the 2007 - 2013 MFF that tackles innovation in the light of the need to improve the EU's competitiveness and economic environment. The aim of EU activity in the field of research is to reinforce national research efforts by creating a frontier-free European research area, enabling scientists across the EU to join forces in pursuit of excellence. Key budget-related issues 6. The original Commission proposal for the 7th Framework Programme for Research (FP7) foresaw an overall amount of Community financial participation of EUR 72 726 million for the period 2007-2013.

It aims at promoting research at the highest level of excellence. Support will be provided to trans-national cooperation in nine thematic areas: health, food-agriculture-biotechnology, information-communication technologies, nanosciences-nanotechnologies-materials-new production technologies, energy , environment (including climate change), transport, socio-economic sciences-humanities, security-space. § Ideas (EUR 260,8 million in PDB 2007): The objective of this Specific Programme is to reinforce excellence, dynamism and creativity in European research and improve the attractiveness of Europe for the best researchers from both European and third countries, as well as for industrial research investment, by providing a Europe-wide competitive funding mechanism for "frontier research" executed by individual teams. § People (EUR 430,2 million in PDB 2007): This Programme aims at strengthening the human potential in research and technology in Europe by supporting training and career development of
