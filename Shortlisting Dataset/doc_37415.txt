WRITTEN QUESTION E-0205/05 by Robert Evans (PSE) to the Commission (28 January 2005) Subject: Illegal trapping of birds in southern Europe Constituents have shared concerns with me regarding the illegal hunting of birds in several countries in southern Europe. The RSPB has recently prepared a report on the countries concerned and the dangers to specific species from the actions of hunters. More details can be found on their website http://www.rspb.org.uk/international/illegal_hunting/index.asp . What action is the Commission taking to halt these practices in each of these countries, to ensure that EU legislation is respected and to prevent the slaughter of protected species?
