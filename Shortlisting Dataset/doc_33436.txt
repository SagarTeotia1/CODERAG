Answer given by Mrs Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2009) The Commission is aware of the Swedish TV broadcast which showed feathers being plucked from live geese in painful conditions. The Commission considers, at first sight, that the way feathers were being plucked from the geese in this TV report constitutes a case of cruelty towards animals and does not comply with the provisions of Article 3 of Council Directive 98/58/EC Council Directive 98/58/EC of 20 July 1998 concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, OJ L 221, 8.8.1998 . . The Hungarian authorities share this view and have informed the Commission that they are investigating this case. The Commission has requested information on the results of the investigation from the Hungarian authorities; additional information has also been requested on the results of the inspections required by Article 6 of Directive 98/58/EC and carried out in farms where geese are being kept for the production of down feathers or other products. However, the Commission should point out that the practice of harvesting down feathers from live geese is not forbidden by Community law. The Standing Committee of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes draws a distinction between plucking, which is forbidden, and harvesting, which is not. Harvesting down feathers consists in collecting the duvet when the feathers are ‘ripe’. The Commission has been informed that Hungary has adopted specific national provisions to ensure that minimum welfare requirements are applied during the harvesting. To better evaluate the impact of this practice, the Commission has requested from Member States additional information on harvesting down feathers from geese.
