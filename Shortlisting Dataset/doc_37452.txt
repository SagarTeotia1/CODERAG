Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (25 January 2008) The Commission informs the Honourable Member that it has opened infringement proceedings against the Member States that exceeded their bluefin tuna quotas in 2007. The Commission has not proposed an increase in the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) but has indicated that it will compensate those Member States that were unable to exhaust their 2007 bluefin tuna quotas by making deductions from future quotas of those Member States that had overfished in 2007. The state of the bluefin tuna stock is a cause of great concern to the Commission. The Commission will follow the implementation of the Recovery Plan for bluefin tuna which was agreed unanimously at the November 2007 Fisheries Council, in close cooperation with Member States. In addition to the permanent transposition of the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recovery plan into EC law, the Council also agreed in November 2007 on provisions which require Member States to submit annual fishing plans to the Commission by 31 January. The Commission considers that the establishment of annual fishing plans is key to ensuring full respect of the quotas, since it will allow Member States to monitor closely the individual quota uptake of vessels over 24 metres fishing for bluefin tuna. For vessels under 24 metres and traps, this measure will allow Member States to monitor the uptake of the quota allocated either to producer organisations, or to groups of vessels fishing with similar gears.
