the inland transport sector in Europe by means of three instruments: - European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road (ADR); - Regulations concerning international carriage of dangerous goods by rail (RID); - European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by inland waterways (ADN) ADN is in the process of ratification and is expected to be in force in 2009 at the latest. According to Commission information, nine of the EU countries are signatories of ADN. Two other ADN-based systems (ADN-R and ADN-D) are currently applied in the areas of the Rhine and Danube. But for historic reasons, the existing EU legislation on the transport of dangerous goods is rather complicated. The Commission says that, if nothing is done, the current complex rules are to become even more complex with changes in international agreements. Obsolete rules would remain and confuse the sectors and the risk of non-compliance would increase. The new proposal would repeal four existing directives and two Commission decisions. MEPs also take the view that this simplified Community legislation would also simplify the transposition into national legislation. Administrative procedures for consignor and consignee, will be easier with simplified and harmonised rules. Documentation of transport operations and vehicles is also expected to be simpler with harmonised rules, as would be the training of persons involved and the work dangerous goods safety advisors. Although welcoming the proposal, the Parliament endorsed amendments including several of technical nature which permit Member States to regulate for safety reasons the transport of dangerous goods not yet covered by the Directive and especially in passenger trains. Based on the two-year rhythm of the international agreements ARD, RID and ADN (see above) the period of renewing the authorisation is brought to six instead of five years.

Yes, but under strict conditions 2007-09-10 - 13:45 The European Parliament adopted by a large majority (577 votes in favour to 52 against with 51 abstentions) proposing that the controversial use of mega-liners or 60 tonne lorries in the EU should only be allowed for certain routes at the request of, and within the Member States. During a lively debate, Members were strongly divided on this matter, with some of them claiming that introducing proposals for admitting 60t lorries would induce a definitive imbalance in favour of only one mode of transport and would have a serious impact on the environment and with others saying that this form of road transport innovation deserved a change. Parliament adopted an own-initiative report by Inés AYALA SENDER (PES, ES) on a Commission communication on freight transport logistics in Europe in which the issue of the megatrucks was raised. In a compromise reached by the EPP-ED and PES groups, the House is now
