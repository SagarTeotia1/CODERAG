in the chamber In the course of proceedings a point of order raised by a British Member Daniel Hannan (EPP-ED), during which he drew a parallel between some of the European Parliament’s procedures and parliamentary manoeuvrings in 1930s Germany, provoked strong protests from MEPs across the House. Later in the day, Joseph Daul, leader of the EPP-ED political group, announced the intention to expel Mr Hannan from the group. Mr Daul said that "these comments are unqualified and disgraceful. I respect Mr Hannan as an MEP but his remarks this morning are incompatible with the EPP-ED Group's values. It is for this reason that I will ask the Group to proceed with the expulsion of Mr Hannan, according to our Rules of Procedure and after consultation with the Members of the British Delegation". 20080125STO19648 European Parliament supports Bali roadmap, calls for urgent review on EU biofuels policy: Kyoto to Bali to Copenhagen?
