WRITTEN QUESTION E-3425/04 by Mario Borghezio (IND/DEM) to the Commission (16 December 2004) Subject: Infringement of market regulations in British Telecom purchase of Albacom According to press reports, the British Telecom phone company is taking steps to purchase a controlling share in the Albacom Italian phone company and is making this purchase conditional upon Albacom's ‘restructuring’ of its obligations towards its suppliers, most of which are small or medium-sized enterprises in Padania. Does the Commission not consider that the above aspects of the operation indicate a clear infringement of market regulations, based on a typical move by a large group against SMEs, achieved through delaying tactics and pretexts aimed at obtaining debt reductions to the detriment of the suppliers ? In this particular case, the move is also liable to aggravate the already difficult financial situation of a large section of SMEs in Padania.
