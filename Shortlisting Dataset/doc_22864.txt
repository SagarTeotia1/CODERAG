sustainable development and the related issues of environment, climate change and energy; 8. Points out that the swift setting up, following the Vienna summit, of the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly (EuroLat) as the strategic partnership's parliamentary institution has considerably enhanced the partnership's democratic legitimacy and consolidated its institutional system, which now embraces the discussion, scrutiny and monitoring of partnership-related matters coming within the assembly's remit; 9. Recommends that the Lima summit reiterate the EU's and the LAC's attachment to the principles and values of pluralist representative democracy, freedom of expression and of the press, human rights and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarianism; Joint action in pursuit of effective multilateralism 10. Draws attention to the benefits that the joint commitment to multilateralism can bring the Euro-Latin American partners, which together have an overall population of more than one billion, make up one third of the UN member states and account for more than a quarter of world trade; 11.

Draws attention to the repeated resolutions of the United Nations, the EU-LAC Summit and this Parliament rejecting all coercive measures such as those set out in extraterritorial laws which, owing to their unilateral and extraterritorial nature, are in breach of international law, distort competition between Euro-Latin American partners and undermine their joint commitment to multilateralism; A strong boost for regional integration and the partnership agreements 16.
