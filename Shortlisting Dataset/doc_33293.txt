Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (28 February 2008) In the light of recent changes made to both pharmaceutical Directive 2002/98/EC (OJ L 33, 8.2.2003), Directive 2003/63/EC (OJ L 159, 27.6.2003), Directive 2004/24/EC (OJ L 136, 30.4.2004) , Directive 2004/27/EC (OJ L 136, 30.4.2004), Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (OJ L 378, 27.12.2006) and Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 amending Directive 2001/83/EC (OJ L 324, 10.12.2007). and medical devices legislation Directive 2007/47/EC amending Council Directive 90/385/EEC and Council Directive 93/42/EEC, OJ L 247, 21.9.2007. , the Commission is in the process of updating the Medical Devices (MEDDEV) guidance 2.1/3 relating to the ‘demarcation between Directive 90/385/EEC OJ L 189, 20.07.1990, as amended by Directive 2007/47/EC. on active implantable medical devices, Directive 93/42/EEC OJ L 169, 12.07.1993, as amended by Directive 2007/47/EC. on medical devices and Directive 65/65/EEC Repealed by Directive 2001/83/EC, OJ L311, 28.11.2001. relating to medicinal products and related Directives’. The Commission services are also taking the opportunity to restructure this MEDDEV and to make a distinction between borderline products and combination products. Moreover, in order to ensure a uniform approach within the Community, the Commission services have drafted a Manual that represents the agreed position of the Medical Device Expert Group ‘Borderline and Classification’ Code in the Register of Expert Groups: E01306. on specific borderline products or categories of products. This Manual will be regularly updated in the light of the discussions of this group. Once endorsed by the Medical Device Expert Group ‘Borderline and Classification’ the Manual will be published on the Commission's website. In order to update the MEDDEV guidance 2.1/3, the Commission services have undertaken a broad written consultation of stakeholders through the involvement of the abovementioned expert group, which includes experts from Member States' competent authorities, the relevant Commission services, the European Medicines Agency and industry trade associations. These stakeholders were asked to send their written contributions on the draft revised guidance by the end of January 2008. Due to the participation of the aforementioned interested parties and of experts from competent authorities, it is anticipated that this guidance will be followed within the Member States and, therefore, will ensure uniform application of the directives. In order to work on particular technical aspects of the guidance, and with the aim to prepare and facilitate discussion in the plenary meeting of the Medical Device Expert Group ‘Borderline and Classification’, a small working group has been set up, including Member States' competent authorities representatives, industry representatives, European Association of Authorised Representatives, the European Medicines Agency and the Commission services. This working group will meet for the first time on 6 March 2008. A first discussion on the draft guidance will take place on the occasion of the next Medical Device Expert Group ‘Borderline and Classification’ plenary meeting on 6 May 2008. After this meeting and depending on the outcome of the abovementioned discussion, the revised MEDDEV guidance 2.1/3 will be presented for endorsement on the occasion of the May or December 2008 plenary meeting of the Medical Device Expert Group Code in the Register of Expert
