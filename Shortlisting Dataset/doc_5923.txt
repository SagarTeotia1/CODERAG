Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (15 July 2011) According to the information available to the Commission, most Member States have implemented the information obligations imposed on service providers under Article 22 of the Services Directive Directive 123/2006/EC on services in the internal market, OJ L 376, 27.12.2006. by specific provisions introduced to this effect in their ‘horizontal’ implementing laws. The Commission attaches a great importance to the well functioning of the Services Directive on the ground, in particular as regards its provisions conferring rights to consumers. In this connection, it would like to recall that Chapter VI of the Services Directive, on administrative cooperation, imposes on Member States a number of precise obligations of cooperation and mutual assistance which also apply to national authorities responsible for the supervision of legislation implementing consumer provisions of the Services Directive, including Article 22. For now, the Commission is not aware of specific problems encountered by Member States as regards the concrete application and supervision of this Article. In view of the above, the Commission does not consider necessary, at the moment, to propose a modification of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on the cooperation between consumer authorities Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws, OJ L 364, 9.12.2004. which would aim to extend this instrument to the consumer provisions of the Services Directive. Should the Honourable Member have specific information pointing to problems encountered by national authorities as regards the supervision of these provisions, the Commission stands of course ready to analyse it and consider this matter further.
