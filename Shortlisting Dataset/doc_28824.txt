Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (18 March 2008) The Commission, as a participant in the Middle East Quartet, is grateful that former Prime Minister Tony Blair decided to dedicate his undoubted political energy and skills to the peace process when he left office in June 2007. Since being appointed as the Quartet Representative (QR) Mr Blair has worked energetically to develop projects and activities which will have a rapid impact on the living conditions of Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza. To do this, he has worked in close partnership with both Parties to the conflict in order to address the obstacles to economic development in the occupied Palestinian territory. The Commission considers these activities to be of great political importance and an essential part of the international community's support to the Annapolis process. The Commission moved quickly in the summer of 2007 to support the work of QR Blair via both human and financial resources, and we have closely coordinated ever since. Mr Blair's position has not been called into question in any way.
