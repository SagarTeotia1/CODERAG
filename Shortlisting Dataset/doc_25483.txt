Question for written answer E-012363/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Hans-Peter Martin (NI) (5 January 2012) Subject: SME success: role of screening by venture capital investors In press release IP/11/1513, issued on 7 December 2011, the Commission states that: ‘a company with long-term venture capital investors is more successful than a company that needs to rely on short-term finance from banks. This is commonly attributed to the rigorous screening that a venture capital fund undertakes prior to investing in a company’. Does the Commission have studies, documents, or a substantiated assessment showing why screening by venture capital investors apparently makes small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) more successful? Is it possible that it is not screening as such which makes SMEs more successful, but the fact that venture capitalists invest only in SMEs whose prospects of success are good in any case? If the answer is yes, does that mean that the companies concerned would have been just as successful had they availed themselves of other financing opportunities? If that is so, could the implication be that the contribution of venture capital funds has no bearing on the success of SMEs? If the Commission is of the opinion that venture capital investors do contribute to a company’s success, Are there ways of ensuring (e.g. through further training for company founders, soft state or EU loans, etc.) that SMEs which failed to attract venture capitalist investors could benefit from the advantages normally afforded by support from a venture capital fund?
