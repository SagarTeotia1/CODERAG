Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2006) The Commission confirms that various actions COM(2006) 35 final and SEC(2005) 985 final. have been taken or planned in order to strengthen the communication role of the Permanent Representations of the Commission in Member States. At present, as regards application of EU law, representatives from the European Institute for Legal Studies (Eurojus) working in the Permanent Representations are dealing directly with citizen's questions. Eurojus in the Permanent Representations provides free legal assistance on European Law and its impact on citizens and therefore contributes to faster resolution of specific problems that can be immediately addressed at Member State level. Whenever necessary, complaints and queries are forwarded to the Commission for further examination and potential action under Article 226 of the EC Treaty. The suggestion that the Permanent Representations take on, in any systematic way, the further role of monitoring the correct application of Community Law, including provision of information on the timing and content of national measures transposing directives, would require substantial increase of the Permanent Representation's functions, and this is not presently foreseen. However, the Permanent Representations can play a useful role in overcoming blockages which can occur in communication channels between the Commission and Member States.
