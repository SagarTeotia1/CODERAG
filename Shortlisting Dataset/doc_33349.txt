in July 2003 included reinvested earnings for the first time. Preliminary data are published for a limited number of partners (Intra and extra-EU, including United States, Canada, and Japan). On the other hand, starting from data transmission of 2004, transmission of detailed data from the Member States to Eurostat takes place three months later than happened before (end-September as against end-June), for reasons of harmonisation with the ECB transmission deadline. Detailed data on FDI are therefore published at end-December of year T+1, rather than at end-October of year T+1 as it was until 2003. EU25 As the written question refers to Member States, 25 Member States should be taken into account. For the EU25 FDI data, however, availability is still more limited and covers a shorter time period. Three back years are calculated before the year of the enlargement (2004) and therefore the series including EU25 as reporter (and partners intra-EU25, extra-EU25) start from reference year 2001. Data for the EU25 aggregate (FDI flows, stocks and income) were published for the first time in April 2004 (for 2001 and 2002) and then in the News Release N° 94/2004 of 29 July 2004, for 2003 and revised 2002 flows. Intra-EU FDI data for inward flows of the EU25 and Member States are shown in table 4 (sent direct to the Honourable Member and to Parliament’s Secretariat) for the available years. The partner considered in table 4 is ‘intra-EU25’, and not ‘intra-EU15’ as in table 3. EU25 aggregates for 2001 were estimated by Eurostat on the basis of data made available internally by Member States, but not yet published for several Member States. Data for the Euroarea as reporter with partner EU25 are not yet published. Table 4 includes the sum of data shown in the same table for participating and non-participating Member States for 2002 and 2003. The sum for non-participating Member States is calculated as EU25 minus Euroarea Member States. For 2001, these data cannot be calculated. Concluding remarks In his written question E-1350/03 OJ C … , the Honourable Member sought the view of the Commission on the effects of the introduction of the Euro on cross-border investment for the participating Member States. The data on intra-EU FDI inflows presented corroborate the answer given at the time that there are indications of a positive effect of the introduction of the Euro on FDI inflows for Euroarea Member States. The subject remains of course rather complex, as it was already pointed out in the answer to E-1350/03 . The Honourable Member may be interested in knowing that some research at academic level was developed on this topic. An interesting reference is a Working Paper by Pavlos Petroulas of the Stockholm University (http://www.ne.su.se/paper/wp04_05.pdf), which uses the Eurostat FDI database as the source of the data.
