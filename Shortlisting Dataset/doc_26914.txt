the basis of EU energy and environmental legislation, and encourages the countries of the wider Black Sea region to adhere to the Treaty on the Energy Charter, while also favouring the provision of assistance by the EU, the EIB and the EBRD for the modernisation of energy infrastructure in the ENP countries; 14. Reminds the members of the Energy Charter of their duties under the treaty and its amendments and protocols; stresses that any dispute settlements must be fully respected and applied; encourages accession to full membership by the current observer countries of North Africa; 15. Takes the view that the EU should encourage better cooperation on energy matters with ENP countries in order to ensure the security of energy supply and to promote the EU’s internal market rules; 16. Supports further cooperation in sectors such as industry, SMEs, research, development and innovation, ICT including security of IT systems, space, and tourism; welcomes the Commission’s proposals concerning the development of a common knowledge and innovation space and of a digital economy based on ICT, and calls on the Member States and neighbouring countries to reaffirm their commitment to progress towards this development; reiterates the importance of effective trade and investment facilitation mechanisms between the EU and its neighbouring countries in order to reinforce trade partnerships and allow economic operators, especially SMEs, to access adequate, reliable information on trade and investment conditions in partner countries; 17. Stresses the benefits of joint research programming initiatives by the EU and its neighbours; encourages in consequence the further development of coordination, cooperation and synergies among all the programmes and research activities at national level funded by the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, with a view to enhancing the overall coherence and effectiveness of environmental research actions in the region, taking as an example the joint research programme for the Baltic (BONUS 169); 18. Is aware of the achievements of the BSI (Black Sea Interconnection) project in terms of the creation of a regional research and education network in the wider Black Sea region, as well as its links with GEANT, and calls on the Commission to continue its support for research projects in the Black Sea region such as HP-SEE, SEE-GRID, SCENE, CAREN and BSRN; 19. Looks forward to the Commission’s proposals on the new European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), welcomes the Commission’s ‘more for more’ benchmark and encourages further differentiation, flexibility and conditionality in granting assistance; encourages the implementation of a ‘country-oriented logic’, which could take the form of ‘differentiated partnership contracts’ within the ENP; notes that, while EU financial rules must be fully observed, EU assistance should be easily accessible and mainly focused on support for concrete projects and less consultancy, and the pursuit of excellence should not be hampered by a rigid framework; 20.
