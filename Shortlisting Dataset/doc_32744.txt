WRITTEN QUESTION E-4003/06 by Maria Matsouka (PSE) to the Commission (21 September 2006) Subject: Wide-ranging detrimental effects of passive smoking The findings of research presented recently to the 16th International Congress on Pulmonary Disease show that passive smoking is particularly dangerous. They show, in fact, that passive smokers have an approximately 80 % greater risk of lung cancer and heart disease (related studies have also shown that their mortality rate is 30 % higher). More than 79000 people in the EU die every year through exposure to passive smoking, 19242 of whom are non-smokers (some 3000 of whom are exposed to passive smoking at their place of work). In total, 7.5 million people are passive smokers at their place of work in the 14 Member States of the EU in which the research was carried out. According to the same study, banning smoking at the workplace could reduce the incidence of lung cancer by 8 % and asthma and chronic bronchitis by up to 30 %. 1. Does the Commission have details about the health risks posed by passive smoking and the financial cost entailed in terms of public health in each Member State? 2. What is the situation in Greece, the smoker's ‘paradise’, where bans on smoking are flagrantly flouted while, at the same time, some 45 % of its population smoke? 3. What steps will the Commission take to exert pressure on Member States' governments to introduce a general ban on smoking in public places and, in particular, places of work where there is an even greater threat to citizens' health? How does it propose to monitor the effective enforcement of existing measures?
