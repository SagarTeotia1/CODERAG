and of the other Union agencies; Structural deficits 6. Calls, furthermore, into question the capability of the College to fully overcome its structural problems with respect to: – the small size of the College which calls into question its capacity to handle effectively the complexities of the EU's Financial and Staff regulations; – the location of the College's secretariat, in Bramshill, some 70 Kilometres from London, which is a disadvantage, inter alia, as regards recruitment and public transport links; – the College's governance costs which are not insignificant, given that while employing only 24 staff, the College has a 27-member Governing Board (figures as at the start of the 2008 financial year); 7. Suggests, therefore, examining the possibility of attaching the College to Europol as a concrete solution to the College's structural and chronic problems; suggests, also, that the Court of Auditors carry out a comprehensive review of regulatory agencies to examine, inter alia, the proportion of operating, governance and operational costs and assess ways of addressing structural or other problems, with a view to complementing the Commission's own evaluation of regulatory agencies; Court of Auditors' position 8. Notes that the Court of Auditors is not ready to rapidly deliver an opinion in letter form evaluating the establishment of the College's Action Plan as requested by the Parliament in paragraph 23 of its resolution OJ L 252, 25.9.2010, p. 233. which forms an integral part of its Decision of 5 May 2010 on discharge for the financial year 2008; takes, nevertheless, into due account the Court of Auditors' declaration that it has already extensively reported in its specific annual reports of the years from 2006 to 2008 on the problems it has found in the College; The College's Action Plan for 2010-2014 9. Notes that the new Director of the College has delivered on time the Action Plan as requested in paragraph 22 of the Parliament's abovementioned resolution of 5 May 2010; regrets, nevertheless, the lack of accuracy in the description of the specific actions to be taken by the College; regrets also that most of the indicators proposed by the College are vague and do not always clearly help to assess the implementation of the objectives; 10. Notes that, at the request of the Parliament to adopt an Action Plan, the Director of the College and its Governing Board have estimated a realistic four-year period (i.e. from 2010 to 2014) in which to meet the objectives set out in the Annex to the Parliament's abovementioned resolution of 5 May 2010; is, therefore, not ready to accept that the College needs four more years to reach an acceptable standard of good administration as expected from a regulatory agency; 11. Requests that the Director of the College inform the discharge authority on the progress of the implementation of the Action Plan every six months; Specific remarks Validation of the financial procedures and new accounting system (Article 43 of the framework Financial Regulation) 12. Voices concern at the difficulties experienced in 2008 in migrating the old accounting system to ABAC and the late implementation
