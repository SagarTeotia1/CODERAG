to the regional, national or local circumstances; – since ICTs contribute to competitiveness and to raising the level of knowledge and skills, equal importance should be accorded to the economic and the cultural effects of the development of ICTs, so that this benefits employment, enterprises and social cohesion; – special attention should be paid to possible problems arising from the concentration of mobile and internet services and their content; urges the Commission to monitor the consequences of such concentration; – individual access should therefore be developed to the same extent as collective access; – e -Inclusion should centre on accessibility, on the supplying of on-line services (government services, education and continuing training, health and commerce) and on teaching and learning how to use these, with the possibility of the most essential basic services being free of charge on the agreement of all partners, and Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) being one way of gaining access to these services; 5. Stresses: – the strategic role of R&D at every stage and at every level of the process: development and rolling-out of new technologies, and procedures for comparison and evaluation of the Plan of Action, with the establishing of observatories; – the need to factor into priority research socio-economic studies enabling an assessment of the human and social impact of access to ICTs; – the opportunity presented by the current drawing-up of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and the increase in the research budget; – the importance of developing local skills and competences by supporting computer science education and research; – the need to develop entrepreneurial and innovative capacities to enable countries to use ICTs to develop services and systems that directly address their societal needs; 6. Welcomes: – the emphasis placed by the Commission on the need for all countries to establish independent regulatory bodies and the need for a clear competition law framework within which investors can participate securely; – the importance given to stepping up international communications, regulatory co-operation and exchanges of best practice; 7. Recommends: – that the Union and its Member States fast-track the setting-up of ICT research networks, by means of infrastructure instruments such as GEANT, based on centres of excellence or technological platforms and networks of experts and education and continuing training practitioners; – an active policy of support for the use of common information-based schemes which benefit from public funding to disseminate research results in the fields for which they prove useful – that public decision-makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector have an input in these areas where appropriate; 8. Calls on the Union and Member States: – to view the WSIS as a spur for cooperation in traditional areas of geographical or historical proximity (Mediterranean, ACP, etc) and for new cooperation with developing countries; – to take into account, as a priority, the infrastructure and training requirements of less-developed countries; – to take into consideration local and regional knowledge and know-how in cooperation centring on practices and contents; – to make sure that the EU's efforts
