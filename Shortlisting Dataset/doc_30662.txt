Question for written answer E-002079/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marietta Giannakou (PPE) (7 March 2011) Subject: EU policy in the Middle East and the countries of North Africa At a time when the political landscape in the Middle East and the countries of North Africa is undergoing dramatic change, and when unprecedented violence against demonstrators is escalating in many countries, the EU continues to be a mere observer of developments. The wave of protest and popular uprisings is steadily spreading, with Libya becoming the new focus of violent clashes between government supporters and demonstrators. In view of the foregoing, will the Commission say: What presence is the EU maintaining, and what significant actions has it undertaken to prevent bloodshed in the region? Is the Commission planning to suspend funding programmes to regimes in the region which are violating fundamental human rights? In the case of Libya, there is an unaccountable ambivalence towards the Gaddafi regime. Mere condemnation of the violent suppression of demonstrations in Libya is obviously not enough to resolve the situation. Does the Commission intend to take a clear position on the Gaddafi regime? Does the Commission take the view that the European Union’s stance so far towards the totalitarian regimes in the region has been misguided? Does it think that in the interests of stability, there has been a particular tolerance towards regimes which have, amongst other things, been linked to terrorism? What is the EU’s intended stance towards the Muslim Brotherhood, which, according to reports by reliable observers, is a key factor behind the protests in North Africa?
