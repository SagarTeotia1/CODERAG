WRITTEN QUESTION E-4849/06 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 November 2006) Subject: Operation of surveillance cameras in Athens The independent Authority for the Protection of Personal Data has imposed a fine of EUR 3000 on the Greek police for operating surveillance cameras in squares, meeting places etc. where their use had been prohibited by the Authority. The Ministry for Public Order has issued a press release claiming that the surveillance is in fact legal and that the police are protecting individuals' civil rights, not infringing them. It has also appealed to the Council of State (the supreme administrative court) against the Authority's decision. Given that the primary duty of the Authority for the Protection of Personal Data is to protect citizens' rights from arbitrary acts by the authorities, does the Commission consider that the response of the Ministry for Public Order undermines the standing of the independent Authority? In the event that the Council of State vindicates the Ministry for Public Order, what means are available to the Authority to impose its point of view?
