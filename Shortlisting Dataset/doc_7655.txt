sustainable development; calls on the Commission to accord the same weight to the working environment and to the health and safety of workers as to ensuring the creation of more and better jobs; 11. Recognises that, to pursue a European industrial policy in sectors of strategic interest to Member States’ economies, it is essential to strengthen existing industries, to keep the internal market open, applying regulation as and where necessary, and to allow for factors related to competitiveness which could affect employment levels in many Member States, as well as supporting the modernisation of all European industry that is already competitive or could be enabled to compete; 12. Is convinced that the future of Europe's manufacturing industries lies in increased added value and better quality; is therefore concerned that overall EU trade is still concentrated in sectors with medium-high technologies and low to intermediate labour skills; believes that education and training at all levels are key issues, both to improve labour force qualifications and to facilitate structural change; regrets the fact that the Communication does not pay enough attention to education, lifelong learning and training; urges the Member States to increase their efforts to attract more young students into technical and scientific studies; 13. Welcomes the Commission’s recognition of the fact that a well-trained and flexible labour force is the EU’s most important resource and competitiveness factor; calls on the EU to concentrate on enhancing skills development for workers at all levels, particularly unskilled workers; 14.

Calls on undertakings to ensure the best possible training conditions for workers by providing ongoing training for their employees, with undertakings drawing up skills plans and taking responsibility in a general way for lifelong learning and the continuing training of their worker; 17. Considers that the transfer of knowledge and the application of research results in new products and processes is still too weak in the manufacturing industries, and especially in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); in this respect, sees a clear need to bridge the current gap between the research community and the market sector; is convinced that special attention must be given to jointly tackling this problem and urges the Commission and the Member States to swiftly come forward with concrete measures to solve it; to this end stresses that the possibilities offered by the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation should be utilised rationally and as effectively as possible; 18.
