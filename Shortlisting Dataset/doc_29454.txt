the experience gained from the application of Directive 91/414/EEC and of recent scientific and technical developments, Directive 91/414/EEC should be replaced. (4) By way of simplification, the new act should also repeal Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances OJ L 33, 8.2.1979, p. 36. Directive as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council (OJ L 158, 30.4. 2004 , p. 7, corrected version in OJ L 229, 29.6.2004, p. 5). . However, the main principles of Directive 79/117/EEC should be maintained in the new act. (5) To simplify application of the new act and to ensure consistency throughout the Member States, it should take the form of a Regulation. (6) Plant production has a very important place in the Community. One of the most important ways of protecting plants and plant products against harmful organisms, including weeds, and of improving agricultural production is the use of plant protection products. (7) Various types of crop are of significance in the Community for both large-scale and small-scale production. These various types of production should be protected by allowing the use of different plant protection products. (8) Plant protection products can also have non-beneficial effects on plant production. Their use may involve risks and hazards for humans, animals and the environment, especially if placed on the market without having been officially tested and authorised and if incorrectly used. Therefore, harmonised rules should be adopted on the placing on the market of plant protection products. (9) The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment , and at the same time to ensure the competitiveness of European agriculture. Particular attention should be paid to the protection of vulnerable groups of the population, including pregnant and nursing women, embryos and foetuses, infants and children. The precautionary principle should be applied and ensure that industry demonstrates that substances or products produced or placed on the market do not adversely affect human health or the environment and are not suspected of doing so . (10) In order to avoid animal testing, testing on vertebrate animals for the purposes of this Regulation should be undertaken only as a last resort. This Regulation, and the legislation establishing data requirements for active substances, plant protection products, safeners and synergists, should ensure that testing on vertebrate animals is minimised and that double-testing is avoided, and promote the use of non-animal test methods and intelligent testing strategies. Existing results from tests on vertebrate animals should be shared in the process of developing new plant protection products. In accordance with Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes OJ L 358, 18.12.1986, p. 1. Directive as amended by Directive 2003/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 230, 16.9.2003, p. 32).
