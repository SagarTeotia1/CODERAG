WRITTEN QUESTION E-4696/07 by Esko Seppänen (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (28 September 2007) Subject: Wine, olives, and tobacco The volume of the support for wine-, olive-, and tobacco-growing is no longer deducible from the EU budget. Does the Commission have any calculations on the aid granted in 2006 or estimates as to the EU funding to be earmarked for wine-, olive-, and tobacco-growing under the 2008 budget? If so, could it publish them?
