Question for written answer P-5037/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Emma McClarkin (ECR) (29 June 2010) Subject: Warranties for electrical goods under EU Directive 1999/44/EC It has been brought to my attention that one of the main supermarket chains in the UK is not adhering to the legislation stipulating that electrical goods must be replaced if faulty within two years of purchase. My constituent has been informed that, under the UK Sale of Goods Act, after 12 months the supermarket is not obliged to give the customer a full refund. Could you please clarify whether the national Act supersedes EU Directive 1999/44/EC OJ L 171, 7.7.1999, p. 12 . ?
