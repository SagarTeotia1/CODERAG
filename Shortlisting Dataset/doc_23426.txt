ORAL QUESTION H-0045/07 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jean-Paul Gauzès to the Commission Subject: Statements by Mrs Fischer Boel to the Financial Times - 30 December 2006 On 30 December 2006, Mrs Fischer Boel told the Financial Times that after 2013 there would be ”an increase in the number of part-time farmers”. They ”would live in the countryside but need an income outside the farming sector” to compensate for the reduction in subsidies which currently amount to EUR 43 billion. 2013 is an important landmark in the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will have to take into account developments in agricultural practices and adapt to the needs of an enlarged Europe. However, questioning the future of the farming profession in this way is unacceptable. This kind of statement is a provocation to farmers! What were the Commissioner’s reasons for making this statement, given that nothing has been decided as yet? Is it advisable to make this kind of announcement given the current environment of scepticism about Europe?
