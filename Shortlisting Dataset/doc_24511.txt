WRITTEN QUESTION E-4726/07 by Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (2 October 2007) Subject: Livestock impacts 4: diet In responding to the findings of the United Nations Food and Agriculture (FAO) report, ‘Livestock’s Long Shadow — Environmental issues and Options’ (2006), has the Commission investigated the dietary implications of increasing the proportion of plant foods consumed by EU citizens, including plants yielding high levels of protein and currently under-utilised crops that may in future be grown in the EU in greater quantities? If, in order to respond to the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the global environmental impact of agricultural production, it becomes necessary to cap or reduce consumption of meat, milk and eggs, will the Commission provide advice for consumers on how to make best use of plant-based alternatives to animal products? Has the Commission considered involving the European Food Safety Authority in dealing with questions of this nature? Specifically, would the Commission request an opinion from EFSA as to the most environmentally sustainable foods available to EU consumers, taking into account greenhouse gas emissions and emissions from transport, as well as land and water use, and the possible beneficial impact on wildlife habitats if land use from agricultural production can be reduced overall due to a reduction in the amount of arable land needed to grow animal feed crops? Finally, is the Commission aware of research such as that conducted by L. Baroni et al, which attempts to compare environmental impacts resulting from different dietary patterns (see: ‘Evaluating the environmental impact of various dietary patterns combined with different food production systems’, European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , 2006, 1-8), and does the Commission consider such research valuable in ensuring that economic activity is environmentally sustainable?
