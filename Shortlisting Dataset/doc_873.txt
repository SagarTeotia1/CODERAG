written and oral evidence on transposition Conclusions I. Introduction I.1. The mandate This part of the report (Part II) aims to provide the Committee of Inquiry into the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society (EQUI) with information on whether Directive 92/96/EEC Council Directive 92/96/EEC of 10 November 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance and amending Directives 79/267/EEC and 90/619/EEC (third life assurance Directive), OJ L 311 , 14/11/1997, p.34. (the Third Life Directive or 3LD) was correctly transposed and properly implemented at the national level in the UK by its competent authorities. The mandate further specifies this section by reproducing Recital 7 of the 3LD relating to " the monitoring of the financial health of insurance undertakings, including their state of solvency, the establishment of adequate technical provisions and the covering of those provisions by matching assets ". This analysis of the transposition and implementation of the Directives must be undertaken with regards to the specific circumstances surrounding the Equitable Life Assurance Society (ELAS) as well as from the viewpoint of the whole life insurance sector, particularly with regard to its regulatory regime. Consequently, the committee needs to identify first of all those provisions of UK national law intended to give effect to the requirements of the Directives, and examine whether these requirements were transposed in a full and timely manner. Secondly, the committee will need to examine if the application by the various UK authorities of those national legal provisions which transposed the Directive has been in conformity not only with UK but also with EU law. For this purpose, it will have to clarify the respective responsibilities of the various financial authorities involved in the supervision of Equitable Life during the reference period. Detailed investigations need to be carried out to establish by whom, when and how Equitable Life's solvency, its accounting and provisioning practices, were supervised and how the authorities responded to possible weaknesses. This part (Point II.2.1) will also examine in detail how the Commission has monitored the implementation of the 3LD. This section of this part is closely linked to Part V of this report on systematic weaknesses in the Commission. I.2. The scope (directive and time) The directive The mandate limits EQUI's scope to the 3LD, adopted in 1992, and the directive that codified it (hereafter, the “codified directive” Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 concerning life assurance (OJ L 345, 19.12.2002, p 1). Directive as last amended by Directive 2005/68/EC (OJ L 323, 9.12.2005, p. 1). or CD), adopted in 2002. However, it should be pointed out that the earlier directives, which were amended by the 3LD and then subsequently codified by the CD, also need to be examined, i.e. the first First Council Directive 79/267/EEC of 5 March 1979 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct life assurance, OJ L 063 , 13/03/1979 P. 0001 - 0018; Second Council Directive 90/619/EEC of
