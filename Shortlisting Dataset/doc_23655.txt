Change OJ L 33, 7.2.1994, p. 11. , is to achieve stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level which prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. (3) Council Decision 2002/358/EC of 25 April 2002, concerning the conclusion of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfillment of commitments thereunder OJ L 130, 15.5.2002, p. 1. commits the Community and its Member States to reduce their aggregate anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol by 8% compared to 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012. (4) Annex II of Decision 2002/358/EC lays down different reduction targets for individual Member States. The Member States are therefore required to take individual measures. Individual Member States must therefore also be able to take, or maintain, adequate measures to attain their national reduction targets. ( 5 ) Provision should be made for the prevention and minimisation of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases, without prejudice to Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste OJ L 194, 25.7.1975, p. 39. Directive as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1). , Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control OJ L 257, 10.10.1996, p. 26. Directive as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003. , to Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of life vehicles OJ L 269, 21.10.2000, p. 34. Directive as amended by Commission Decision 2002/525/EC (OJ L 170, 29.6.2002, p. 81). and to Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 24. Directive as amended by Commission Directive 2003/118/EC (OJ L 345, 31.12.2003, p. 106). . (6) Since alternatives to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) do exist for the vast majority of applications, it is essential to restrict their use to the applications where there is no alternative available. ( 7 ) Member States are taking or planning differing measures to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Such differing measures by Member States could create obstacles or distort competition within the internal market. It is therefore appropriate to take measures at Community level to ensure that the internal market is protected through the harmonisation of requirements on monitoring, containment and marketing and use of fluorinated greenhouse gases. ( 8 ) Marketing and use restrictions for certain applications of fluorinated greenhouse gases are considered appropriate to prevent distortions in the internal market that could result from differing measures taken by Member States. Where viable alternatives are available and improvement of containment and recovery is not feasible, voluntary initiatives by some industry sectors needs to be taken into account as well as the fact that the development of alternatives is still ongoing. ( 9 ) The Kyoto Protocol requires reporting on emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases and data on
