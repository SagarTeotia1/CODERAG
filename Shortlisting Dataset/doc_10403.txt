Enschede (the Netherlands), H. whereas after the Toulouse disaster, the overloading of communication lines made it difficult to exchange the information which is so vital in such circumstances, 1. Pays its respects to the victims of the Toulouse disaster and expresses its sympathy and support for the injured, their families and all who have suffered; 2. Calls for the reintroduction of an emergency budget heading permitting European Union financial aid when natural, technological and environmental disasters occur; 3. Calls for great efforts to be made at the European Union level to step up European coordination of civil protection measures, so that in emergencies there is information on the resources in the Member States that can be mobilised, in order to allow rapid intervention, facilitate the work of experts from different Member States and improve communications and notification of the public; to this end calls for sufficient financial and human resources to be allocated; 4. Stresses that consultation with the public, associations and all the relevant authorities in at-risk areas must be improved; insists that they must be better informed, aware and trained in rapid reaction; would like to see this need taken into account when the proposal for a directive on public access to environmental information is next considered; 5. Calls on the Commission, as part of the revision of the Seveso II Directive, to learn from the experience of the Toulouse explosion, particularly by strengthening safety rules and introducing stricter rules for the siting and proximity of classified establishments in residential areas and areas of substantial public use; a safety area remains to be defined depending on the degree of danger of their activities; 6. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
