Question for written answer E-003610/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (12 April 2011) Subject: Particles of Xenon-133 gas detected in the Azores Particles of Xenon-133 gas originating from the Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan have been detected in the Azores. According to a Portuguese university research scientist; the ‘tiny traces’ discovered do not pose a threat to health, since ‘the quantities are minimal and break down within half a dozen days’. Caesium-137 and Strontium-90, which are ‘deposited on the ground and have a half-life of more than 30 years’, are more dangerous. The research scientist pointed out, however, that ‘the modelling carried out at an altitude of 2 500 metres indicates that it (the Caesium-137) is arriving in small quantities and does not indicate that it is reaching the ground’. What information does the European Commission have on the scale of and risks from the contamination in question?
