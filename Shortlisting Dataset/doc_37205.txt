Question for written answer P-000060/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (19 January 2011) Subject: Delays in payments by public administrations Following approval of the revision of Directive 2000/35/EC, does the Commission consider it acceptable that in Spain, in spite of the provisions laid down in national law on deadlines for payments by public administrations, the majority of autonomous and local public administrations are systematically failing to meet the deadlines for payments to contractors and suppliers, with the average payment period for public administrations in Spain standing at 154 days? It might be pointed out that some autonomous communities are taking more than 360 days to make payments, and many town councils are taking more than 600 days.
