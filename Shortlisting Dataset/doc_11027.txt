Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (25 May 2007) The EU is a major player in maritime transport. The Commission, in its communication ‘A European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships’ COM(2002)595 final. identified the need to reduce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions from ships. This has been endorsed by the European Council of March 2007, which called for addressing emissions from international maritime transport. Against this background, the Commission recently supported a study to examine different policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport. The three most cost effective options identified by the study were: i) inclusion of maritime transport in EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS); ii) differentiation of harbour dues based on environmental performance of vessel; iii) mandatory CO2 index limits for ships visiting EU ports. The Commission is currently evaluating different policy options.
