Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2006) The Commission shares, in principle, the objective of having consolidated anti-fraud legislation, and has assessed the question before submitting its proposal The new proposal for amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 (OLAF Regulation) was adopted by the Commission on 24 May 2006 Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), OJ L 136, 31.5.1999. ; it replaces the proposal made in February 2004. Preliminary reactions from Member States on the Commission proposal seem to confirm the assessment that this is currently not feasible. In agreement with requests made by Parliament and the Court of Auditors, the changes suggested by the Commission focus on the improvements in the OLAF procedures and modalities for the exercise of its investigative function and working methods. They do not intend to alter the acquis communautaire on the scope of external investigative powers, as set forth in Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities, OJ L 292, 15.11.1996. . Consolidating the whole anti-fraud legislation however amounts to an exercise which includes the perspective of a debate on the extent of OLAF’s external investigative powers. Regarding the proposal to integrate Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 concerned with on-the-spot checks and inspections into the OLAF Regulation, it should be recalled that Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 is concerned with external investigations and was aimed at laying down general provisions relating to on-the-spot checks conducted by the Commission and the scope of the Commission’s powers with regard to economic operators. The amendment of the OLAF Regulation on the other hand has a different purpose as it is mainly concerned with governance questions and the streamlining and increasing the efficiency of OLAF’s operational working procedures; it does not touch on the basic features governing the extent of OLAF’s investigative powers.
