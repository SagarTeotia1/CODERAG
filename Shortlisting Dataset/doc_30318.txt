Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (29 February 2012) The project PALMPROTECT (Strategies for the eradication and containment of the invasive pests Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier and Paysandisia archon Burmeister) http://ec.europa.eu/research/bioeconomy/agriculture/projects/palm_protect_en.htm , funded by the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007-2013), started on 1 January 2012. It is therefore too early to present any result. PALMPROTECT is expected to develop technologies for the early detection and monitoring of these pests (e.g. acoustic devices, thermal detection) and methods to eradicate, control and contain them (including physical, chemical, biological and semiochemical-based control methods). As regards financial support, under the Union plant-health regime established by the Council Directive 2000/29/EC OJ L 169, 10.7.2000. , Member States may receive, at their request and subject to certain conditions, a ‘plant health control’ EU financial contribution to cover expenditure relating directly to the necessary measures which have been taken for the purpose of eradication or containment of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus . The FP7 project Q-Detect http://qdetect.org/0_home/index.php is currently developing and testing acoustic methods for detection of the red palm weevil mainly by monitoring movement and chewing of the larvae within the palm trees. ISEFOR http://www.isefor.com/ , on the other hand, will present its interim results in the next months. No Portuguese partners are involved in these two consortia.
