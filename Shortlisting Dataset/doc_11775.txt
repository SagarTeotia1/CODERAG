Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2012) REACH Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, OJ L 396, 30.12.2006. aims among other objectives at a high level of protection of human health. It sets out to achieve such goal over time, i.e. by ensuring that risks from Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) are properly controlled and through the substitution of the most hazardous chemicals on the market with suitable alternative substances or technologies, where technically and economically viable. Moreover, in the case of articles containing substances on the REACH candidate list, suppliers, whether industry, downstream users or retailers, have to communicate to the consumer upon request sufficient available information to allow safe use of the article. We are aware that a recent study by the European Consumers' Organisation (BEUC) shows that additional proactive steps might be taken to accompany suppliers of articles towards full compliance with this specific obligation as well as in raising consumer awareness on these provisions. The Commission is considering taking actions to liaise with stakeholders of the retail sector as well as members of the civil society representing consumers. Enforcement is the responsibility of Member States that have to incorporate in their national laws penalties for infringement of REACH. By June 2012 the Commission will publish a report on the operation of REACH, including the enforcement of REACH provisions. REACH is directly applicable and cases of non-compliance with Article 33(2) can also be raised before the appropriate national bodies or courts of every Member State.
