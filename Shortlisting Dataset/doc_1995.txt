WRITTEN QUESTION E-6489/09 by Hans-Peter Martin (NI) to the Commission (4 January 2010) Subject: Opinion on the reliability of accounts The 2008 annual report of the Court of Auditors states, in its opinion on the reliability of the accounts (page 11 of the English-language version), that weaknesses in accounting systems used, which are partly due to the complex legal and financial framework, put at risk the quality of financial information of certain Directorates-General of the Commission (in particular regarding pre-financing, the related cut-off and invoices/cost claims) as well as with regard to the fixed assets of the European Satellite Programme Galileo. For which of the Commission’s DGs is financial information not up to the required quality standards? What specific measures is the Commission taking to improve information provided on pre‑financing, the related cut-off times, invoices and cost claims? What specific measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure transparent accounting, even within complex legal and financial frameworks, such as that of Galileo?
