Question for written answer E-7025/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Luigi de Magistris (ALDE) (14 September 2010) Subject: Roma expulsions from France Since early July, France has been taking measures to deport more than 500 Roma gypsies to their countries of origin — Romania and Bulgaria — as part of a plan that involves the expulsion of 800 Roma by the end of August. These expulsion measures, according to the French authorities, were implemented ‘on a voluntary basis’ and further to payment of ‘humanitarian aid’ consisting of EUR 300 per adult and EUR 100 per child, ‘in full compliance with European rules’ on the free movement of EU citizens. The press and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, however, have refuted the claim that these expulsions are voluntary, while the European Commission, through its Commissioner Reding, has reminded France that it must comply with the rules on freedom of movement and freedom of establishment for European citizens, which lay down procedural safeguards to protect EU citizens who are subjected to deportation measures. NGOs such as Amnesty International and the Voix des Roms have condemned the stigmatisation of an entire people, while the Vatican and the Council of Europe's ECRI (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) have expressed dismay over the French measures that are stigmatising the Roma people. In light of the above, does the Commission not agree that the Roma expulsion policy pursued by France, in the guise of ‘voluntary’ or ‘humanitarian’ repatriation, is clearly in breach of Community law and is thwarting EU and national policies to combat prejudice against gypsies and facilitate the integration of Roma communities in the Member States? Does the Commission not agree that the right to freedom of movement cannot be ‘bought’ or ‘sold’ at the cost of abolishing freedom of movement within the EU and creating discrimination? What measures will the Commission take against France? Does it not agree that the launch of a genuinely coordinated integration plan for the Roma in Europe is essential and can no longer be postponed?
