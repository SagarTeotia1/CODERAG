WRITTEN QUESTION E-4733/06 by Richard Seeber (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (6 November 2006) Subject: Promotion of tourism in Romania and Bulgaria The Romanian Tourist Office has announced that its domestic tourism industry has continuously grown both qualitatively and quantitatively over recent years. In 2003, Romania accommodated a total of over 5.6 million tourists. Within this figure, there were 1.1 million visitors from abroad. In 2005, the total number of tourists stood at over 5.8 million. This industry raised revenues of around EUR 700 million for Romania in 2003. Since the end of the 1950s, Bulgaria has also put considerable effort into the promotion of domestic tourism. This economic sector has developed into an important source of revenue for both countries. However, in comparison with tourism figures from other countries, the unused potential becomes apparent. How can Romania and Bulgaria's tourism industries be consolidated in their growth? In particular, what can be done to increase the number of tourists coming from the rest of Europe?
