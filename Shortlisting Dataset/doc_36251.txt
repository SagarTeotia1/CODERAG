WRITTEN QUESTION E-5786/07 by Herbert Bösch (PSE) to the Commission (23 November 2007) Subject: Unequal aid payments to dairy farmers in Vorarlberg The Vorarlberg Land Government pays dairy farmers ‘aid for measures to improve the quality and health properties of milk and milk products’. Aid levels are much higher for farmers who supply milk to dairies in Vorarlberg than for farmers supplying dairies just over the border in Germany. — What are the criteria governing payment of this aid to improve milk quality? — What is the justification for the unequal treatment of farmers depending on whether they supply milk to dairies in Vorarlberg or in Germany? — Does this not constitute distortion of competition within the meaning of EC law?
