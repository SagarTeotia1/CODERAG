Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (31 August 2011) The Member of the Commission responsible for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy did not say that there was regress. He said, ‘if we have a feeling that instead of going forward you are going backwards, we will probably have to reassess the recommendation to start accession negotiations. Do I see that at this moment? No. Do I see a need for the reform process to be accelerated? Yes, I do.’ The Member of the Commission responsible for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy has said that if the country goes backwards then the Commission would reassess the recommendation for starting accession negotiations. The Commission has fulfilled its institutional role by recommending to start accession negotiations. The decision to start accession negotiations rests with the Council.
