part of the UfM's new projects must be devoted to teaching, school and university exchanges and research, including upgrading the Erasmus Mundus programmes for the Mediterranean and the creation of a Mediterranean Erasmus junior, to step up educational exchanges between the Member States of the UfM, believe MEPs. The resolution supports a rapid implementation of the Mediterranean solar energy project DESERTEC, emphasises the need to develop maritime highways and urges the UfM countries to move towards greater convergence of Euro-mediterranean agriculture policies, in particular as regards rules on food safety, plant health, environmental issues and product quality. Migration policies are one of the priorities of the Euro-mediterranean partnership. The states and institutions of the UfM should devote special attention to the coordinated management of migratory flows, says the resolution. Strengthening parliamentary scrutiny of the UfM The institutional architecture of the UfM will not be complete without parliamentary scrutiny of the process, which should be devolved to the Euromediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA), which should become the parliamentary assembly of the UfM, It could be renamed "Parliamentary Assembly - Union for the Mediterranean", in line with the proposal made at the 6th plenary session in Amman in March 2010. The EMPA should, according to the resolution, provide democratic scrutiny as to the direction of the work, the follow up of projects and the budgetary implementation of the process. In addition, parliamentary committees of the EMPA should conduct regular hearings of the secretary general and the deputy secretaries-general.
