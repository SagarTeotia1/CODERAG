Question for written answer E-000975/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (3 February 2012) Subject: Loan interest rates for postgraduate students wishing to study in part or entirely abroad The Commission's financing initiative for postgraduate students is an important and undeniably welcome development. The Commission has indicated moreover that these loans will be made available at below-market interest rates. In view of this: — Does the Commission have any idea what the interest rate on these loans will be? — Is provision being made for less affluent students to have access to these loans?
