Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (16 July 2010) As stated in its reply to Questions E‑1460/10 by Ms Briard Auconie and E‑2846/10 by Mr Bennahmias http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , the Commission is preparing a communication to be adopted during the course of 2010, on the basis of the new provisions of Article 1565 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the field of sport. The new Treaty provisions in Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide an opportunity to directly promote sport at EU level and to develop the potential of the sector in a new policy context, supported by incentive measures. In addition, due to sport’s cross-cutting nature and its synergies and links with many other EU policies, the Commission is aware of the need to take into account sport policy objectives in other areas and encourage mutually supportive approaches and policy choices. This will be done while taking account of the specific nature of sport in line with Article 165 TFEU. It must however be underlined that Article 165 TFEU expressely excludes initiatives aiming at harmonising the laws and regulations of the Member States. Therefore no regulatory measure is foreseen by the Commission in the field of sport.
