the UfM must make it easier to respond to requests for technical and financial assistance with a view to promoting South-South economic integration; considers that extension and simplification of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin might help in this regard; 13. Highlights the importance of the current negotiations on the Europe-Mediterranean Free Trade Area and encourages the UfM member countries to work on harmonising their positions in the context of WTO negotiations; 14. Calls on the Commission to take account in trade negotiations of the results of existing impact assessments and to assess the effects of the liberalisation process, in the light of climate change and the economic and social crisis, and to enable this to be applied gradually and asymmetrically, as necessary, while protecting comparable production sectors on both shores of the Mediterranean, which are more likely to face competition as a result of greater liberalisation; calls on the UfM to select projects mainly according to social and economic and environmental mitigation needs; 15. Hopes that the association agreements will be reviewed in the light of the new requirements deriving from the financial, economic and social crisis and the food and energy crises; points out that one of the main objectives of creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area must remain that of boosting trade in the service of development and poverty reduction, and hopes that the Road Map adopted at the ministerial summit of 9 December 2009 will help to achieve this objective; 16. Views it as regrettable that socio-economic, commercial and energy aspects, such as direct foreign investment, employment, energy efficiency, the informal economy and poverty reduction, were overlooked in the Paris declaration, and calls for this to be remedied at the Barcelona Summit; 17. Points out that migration policies are one of the priorities of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and calls on the member countries and institutions of the UfM to pay special attention to the coordinated management of migratory flows; stresses that the construction of the UfM is inseparable from a harnessing of human resources and strengthening of exchanges between the peoples of the Mediterranean, and encourages, in addition to the regulation of flows and combating of illegal immigration, the gradual facilitation of freedom of movement between the two shores, the strengthening of integration arrangements for migrants, the drafting of active policies to promote employment and the improvement of conditions for exercising of the right of asylum; considers that the Euromed Ministerial Conference on Migration, held in Albufeira on 18 and 19 November 2007, should be continued; 18. Invites UfM member countries to simplify transfers of funds from migrants to people in their home countries, in particular by endeavouring to reduce the costs incurred; 19. Recalls the importance of what is known as the fourth chapter of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation (on migration, social integration, justice and security) and highlights the need for the UfM to drive forward cooperation on this chapter; 20. Emphasises the strategic importance of issues such as agriculture, rural development, adaptation to climate change and rational water and energy use in Mediterranean countries and calls for
