Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (2 February 2009) The Commission is aware that the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007‑13 has not been submitted to an assessment under Directive 2001/42/EC OJ L 197, 21.7.2001. on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (SEA). In response to the Commission's correspondence, the Irish authorities have expressed the view that it is not covered by the SEA Directive, in that it is not a ‘plan or programme’ in accordance with the definition under Article 2(1). As of 9 January 2009, the Commmission was considering the position put forward by the Irish authorities with a view to taking a decision on the matter.
