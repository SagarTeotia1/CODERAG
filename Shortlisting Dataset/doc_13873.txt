WRITTEN QUESTION P-4471/05 by Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (25 November 2005) Subject: D for Democracy — T for Transparency According to a report in Malta Today of 20 November 2005, the European Commission has awarded a EUR 565000 contract to the media agency of the governing Christian Democratic Party in Malta (Media Link Communications) to provide a daily press review to the European Commission Representation in Malta. The Malta Deputy Prime Minister Tonio Borg is to the best of my knowledge both a nominal shareholder and a director of the Media Link company. Commissioner Wallström’s spokesperson Mikolaj Dowgielewicz was reported to answer the Malta Today queries by saying: ‘The fact that a tenderer was owned by a political party was not considered to be a situation of conflict of interests as defined in the tender specifications’. In view of all this, does not the Commission believe that the award of such a contract to the news agency of a political party (in this case a government party) undermines the whole spirit of Plan D for Democracy, and indeed goes very much against the European citizens’ plea for dialogue on an equal footing?
