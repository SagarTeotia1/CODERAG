WRITTEN QUESTION E-6315/07 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (17 December 2007) Subject: Competition law and defence spending According to Article 296, paragraph 1(b), of the Treaty establishing the European Community, ‘any Member State may take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material.’ Such measures can, however, run counter to the provisions of that Article and alter the conditions of competition in the common market. It is estimated that approximately 90 % of European defence contracts awarded each year (amounting to EUR 80 billion) are not subject to the restrictions of European competition law. 1. Does the Commission consider that the Member States are systematically infringing Article 296? Which specific areas relating to defence contracts present the greatest problems? 2. Does the Commission's forthcoming legislative initiative seeking to optimise export control procedures and the other rules governing defence spending represent an attempt to impose an ‘interpretive’ restriction on the stipulation contained in Article 296? 3. What is the Commission's response to accusations from the European defence industry that its forthcoming legislative initiative will give US industries competitive advantages and discourage European research and development in the defence sector? 4. Given that corresponding US rules obstruct European industries' access to the US domestic market, will the Commission initiate talks to reach a mutual understanding? Does it consider that the relevant agreements concluded within the World Trade Organisation can be applied in this case?
