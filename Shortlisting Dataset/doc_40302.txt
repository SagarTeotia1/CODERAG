Reply (19 April 2010) The European Council (16-17 June 2005) Presidency Conclusions, doc. 10255/1/05 REV 1. agreed that ‘in the area of institutional reforms, the European Council recognises the need to reform the main UN bodies, among them the General Assembly, ECOSOC and the Security Council, with a view to enhancing the representativeness, transparency and efficiency of the system.’ This wording has been repeated in the EU priorities for UNGA 60, 61, 62, 63 and 64. The Council of the EU does not have a position on the modalities of the reform of the UNSC.
