WRITTEN QUESTION E-6062/09 by Barry Madlener (NI) to the Council (3 December 2009) Subject: Turkey thinking of refusing to admit Wilders 1. Is the Council aware of the report ‘Turkey is thinking of refusing to admit Wilders’ http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/5402606/_Turkije_denkt_aan_weigeren_Wilders_.html?p=15,1 ? 2. Does the Council agree that if Turkey were to refuse to admit Geert Wilders — a democratically elected Member of the Netherlands Parliament — to its territory and/or to its centre of government in Ankara, this would be unacceptable? If not, why not? 3. Will the Council immediately halt the accession negotiations, inter alia bearing in mind Turkey's unacceptable attitude? If not, why not?
