Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (30 January 2004) We must inform the Honourable Member that implementation of appropriate measures for sectors in crisis in Portugal is a responsibility of the national authorities alone, which have in fact reached agreement with us on introduction of support mechanisms for enterprises in the sector to which she refers and for public investment (under the Economy and Transport Operational Programmes we have approved C (2000) 1774, 28.7.2000; C (2000) 2382, 28.7.2000. ). On the question of Community support for new Portuguese orders placed with the enterprise to which she refers, we must remind her that it is each Member State's responsibility to ensure that the Community Directives on public contracts are respected.
