WRITTEN QUESTION E-0072/05 by Francesco Speroni (IND/DEM) and Matteo Salvini (IND/DEM) to the Commission (18 January 2005) Subject: Languages on the Italian Chamber of Deputies site The Italian Chamber of Deputies Internet site is available in Italian, English, French, German, Spanish and Arabic. The availability of the last of these languages, which is not an official language in any of the Member States, would appear to be discriminatory vis-à-vis the official EU languages that are not available. While showing due respect for the independence of a parliament, does the Commission intend to suggest that all the EU languages be made available on the above site?
