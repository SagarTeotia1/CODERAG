WRITTEN QUESTION E-2259/06 by Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE) to the Commission (22 May 2006) Subject: Use of premium rate telephone numbers in the UK Is the Commission aware that in the UK telephone numbers starting with 0870 and 0845 are being promoted as low rate numbers but are in fact being charged at premium rates, and that many organisations that people need to call regularly, such as banks, only give these premium numbers even though they have a cheaper landline number that they choose not to advertise? Does the Commission not feel that such practices are against European principles and are unfairly disadvantaging UK consumers? What actions can the Commission take to improve the situation considering that OFCOM, the regulator in the UK, has been so reluctant to act and has indeed been one of the organisations using these premium rate numbers?
