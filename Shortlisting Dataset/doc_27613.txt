WRITTEN QUESTION E-3794/07 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (25 July 2007) Subject: The uncertainties of the Internet Although Internet shopping has taken off in a big way, consumers have diminishing trust in the products or services offered by businesses from other countries, since they fear problems with warranties, refunds and product quality. Furthermore, traders too are confused as they grapple with logistical problems or difficulties relating to conflict-settlement, differences between legal systems, product-replacement and the high cost of carriage. Has the Commission taken any action to protect consumers and traders who use the Internet and are there any plans for a European scheme designed to make Internet trading safe and reliable?
