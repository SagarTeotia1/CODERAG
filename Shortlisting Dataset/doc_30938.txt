Question for written answer P-000742/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (30 January 2012) Subject: Traceability in labelling breadmaking products In Italy, a very high percentage of frozen bread from Romania is being sold bearing an incorrect generic label stating it has been ‘baked and packaged in-store’. In actual fact, this bread is often produced in Romania in small-scale ovens which offer no guarantee of quality, beginning with the cooking process where, for example, unsuitable materials such as tyres, waste containers, removal waste and materials recovered from the demolition of industrial facilities may even be used as fuel. — Will the Commission intervene, as a matter of urgency and to protect the prevailing interests of consumers, to make it mandatory for breadmaking products to be labelled in such a way that they can be traced properly?
