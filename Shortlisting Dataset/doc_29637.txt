Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (15 April 2011) The technical requirements for the European type-approval of motor vehicle headlamps are laid down in UN/ECE Regulation No 112. According to the technical specifications of that regulation the use of plastic materials is allowed but not mandated. Furthermore, if plastic materials are used the respective headlamp needs a special marking in order to be easily identified and needs to fulfil special requirements as laid down in Annex A of UN/ECE Regulation No 112. These include testing regarding the resistance to temperature changes. The requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicle headlamps have proven to be effective. The Commission cannot confirm that car headlamps have to be made of plastic materials and is not aware that type-approved headlamps had to be replaced regularly due to temperature influence.
