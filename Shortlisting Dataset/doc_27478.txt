PECH Dispute over the stock of mackerel On 29.09.2010 the PECH Committee held an exchange of views, in the presence of representatives of the Pelagic Regional Advisory Council, on the fisheries dispute with Iceland and Faroe Islands over the significant increases in their catches of the migratory stock of mackerel unilaterally decided by these countries. The Members urged the Commission to maintain a very firm stand vis-à-vis the unacceptable behaviour of both countries, including, if necessary, a credible threat of sanctions/retaliation. The Commission indicated that it would pursue its efforts to find a solution. 20100930CAN84348
