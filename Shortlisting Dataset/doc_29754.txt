WRITTEN QUESTION E-3911/09 by Andrea Cozzolino (S-D) , David-Maria Sassoli (S-D) , Rita Borsellino (S-D) , Rosario Crocetta (S-D) , Paolo De Castro (S-D) , Mario Pirillo (S-D) and Gianni Pittella (S-D) to the Commission (5 August 2009) Subject: Principle of additionality and commitments undertaken by the Italian Government in relation to the national strategic reference framework (NSRF) Recital 29 and Articles 9 and 15 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund affirm the principle of additionality, according to which Community contributions must not replace those of a Member State. Article 28 of the said Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, furthermore, stipulates that for the Convergence Objective, it is up to the Commission to take a decision on the level of national expenditure guaranteeing compliance with the additionality principle. The Italian Government, moreover, in the context of its negotiations with the Commission relating to the determination of the NSRF, has pledged, in accordance with the additionality principle, some EUR 95 billion in public funding (both national co-financing and FAS funds [national fund for under-utilised areas]) vis-à-vis some EUR 28 billion from the Structural Funds for the period 2007‑13. Decision 166 by CIPE (Interministerial Economic Planning Committee) in 2007 implemented the NSRF and distributed the abovementioned resources so that 85 % would be allocated to the southern Italian regions and 15 % to the centre-north regions. However, there is some concern that the level of national financing in Italy so far, for the Convergence Objective regions, is well below that of the commitments given to the Commission and that the constraints governing the assignment of the funds have not been respected. The decision to use the NSRF resources assigned to the Convergence Objective for a different purpose does not comply with the NSRF adopted by the Commission and thereby fails to meet the Italian Government's commitments at the negotiating table. Lastly, there is also some concern over the fact that in such an adverse economic climate there is a real risk that the expenditure objectives will not be met and that substantial resources made available by the Structural Funds might not be used, or might be used in an inefficient, excessively hasty manner. Can the Commission therefore say what measures it has adopted, or intends to adopt, to ensure that the Italian Government meets its commitments and that all Member States comply with the Community principle of additionality?
