developing countries as its main objective’ See OECD/DAC: ‘Reporting Directives for the Creditor Reporting System’. , must remain a condition for all measures to be funded as part of geographic programmes under the new instrument; calls for a more stringent ODA quota for thematic programmes than under the current DCI, especially for programmes on ‘migration and asylum’, in respect of which the Commission did not demonstrate clearly how activities funded in the context of border controls are eligible as ODA according to the OECD/DAC criteria; 14. Stresses that achievement of the MDGs must remain the prime objective of the instrument for the period until 2015; urges the Commission to ensure that EU aid continues to be consistent with the internationally agreed objectives and targets for development which will be adopted by the United Nations and other competent international organisations for the post-2015 period; 15. Acknowledges the need for non-ODA cooperation with many developing countries for the provision of global public goods; believes that this kind of cooperation should be regulated and that funds should be channelled via one or more separate instruments, so as to ensure transparency and to protect the distinctive nature of development cooperation as an autonomous policy domain in the area of external relations; insists, in line with the commitment made at the European Council of 29-30 October 2009, that financing for climate change should not undermine or jeopardise the fight against poverty and continued progress towards the MDGs, and that the scarce ODA funds available for poverty reduction should not be diverted for non-development purposes in developing countries; stresses that the OECD definition of ODA should not be altered and calls on the Commission to ensure that no development projects financed by the EU conflict with global efforts to mitigate climate change and that all such projects are climate proof, particularly large infrastructure projects or projects in small islands which will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change; 16. Expresses its concern, at a time of serious public budget constraints, about the strong focus placed on private sector investment as a means to leverage more development finance resources; points out that development cooperation is the only external action policy (besides humanitarian aid) which has not been designed to serve EU interests but rather to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations on this planet; therefore, urges the Commission to ensure that any public finance used to support private sector investment in the South is not diverted from already under-funded sectors (as in the case of the programmes for non-state actors and local authorities for instance), and that such support will effectively enable the development of the domestic private sector and small and medium enterprises in low-income countries; 17. Agrees that a differentiated approach to the diverse group of developing countries is needed, and that traditional financial aid may become less relevant for emerging countries; considers that aid for emerging countries, while promoting sustainable economic growth, should still focus on reinforcing the partner country ’ s fiscal policy and promoting mobilisation of domestic
