Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2006) The Honourable Member raises the issue of breast cancer in men. According to Dr. Pisani from WHO/IARC the data on incidence of breast cancer collected by the European Network of Cancer Registries (ENCR) for EU25 show that about 1 % of all breast cancers affect men. Breast cancer in women is the most frequent cancer in Europe, while breast cancer in men appears as a rare cancer. The Commission is not aware that any large randomised clinical trials have been possible and thus screening methodologies have not been validated for this cancer. Instead, clinical examination by the physician and breast self examination by men are the most common way of detecting symptoms of male breast cancer. Within its public health activities, the Commission has focused on cancers with a high incidence in men, for which proven screening methods or primary prevention are available, e.g. lung, colorectal and prostate cancer.
