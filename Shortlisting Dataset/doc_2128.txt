EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The reference for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Community law and on the validity of acts of the Community institutions is a procedure that aims at ensuring the utmost uniformity in the application of Community law and at establishing for that purpose effective co-operation between the Court of Justice and national courts. According to Article 234 of the EC Treaty, the initiative of referring the question must emanate from a court or tribunal of a Member State. As concerns preliminary rulings, Article 20 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Communities currently provides that the parties, together with the Member State and the Commission, have the right to submit statements of case or written observations. The same right applies to the Council of the European Central Bank, where the act the validity or interpretation of which is in dispute originates from one of them, and to the European Parliament and the Council where the act the validity or interpretation of which is in dispute was adopted jointly by those two institutions.
