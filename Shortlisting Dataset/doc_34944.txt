Question for written answer E-011242/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Silvia-Adriana Ţicău (S&D) (13 January 2011) Subject: Implementation of EU strategy for the Danube Region On 8 December 2010 the Commission adopted the EU Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR) and the relevant action plan. The added value of this strategy is that Member States will be able to pool existing financial resources, giving greater priority to strategic projects for the Danube region. Accordingly, Member States may take advantage of the mid-term review of the current financial perspective to review their operational programmes and thereby allocate the necessary funding to projects included in the EUSDR's action plan. Will the Commission initiate a dialogue with the Member States along the River Danube to support them in their review of the operational programmes and in the use of the funds that are needed for the implementation of the projects set out in the action plan?
