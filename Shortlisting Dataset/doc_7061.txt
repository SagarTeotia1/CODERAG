Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (8 May 2009) As regards the application of the relevant European directive, the date on which the request for recognition was made in Austria would be decisive. Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications had to be applied from 20 October 2007. Consequently, Directive 93/16/EEC has been repealed with effect from 20 October 2007 Council Directive 93/16/EEC of 5 April 1993 to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications, OJ L 165, 7.7.1993, pp. 1‑24, version 1993L0016, 1.5.2004. . If the request for recognition of a third country diploma held by an EU Citizen, which previously had been recognised in another Member State, had been made on or after 20 October 2007, Directive 2005/36/EC would in principle apply. According to Article 3 (3) of this directive such recognition falls under the general system of recognition only if the holder of the qualification has three years' professional experience in the profession concerned on the territory of the Member State which recognised the evidence of formal qualifications, in accordance with Article 2(2). However, Austria has not yet transposed Directive 2005/36/EC, in particular as regards Article 3(3) for the medical profession. Therefore, Austria cannot impose on an EU‑citizen the new obligation of three years' professional experience, which it has not yet transposed into national law.
