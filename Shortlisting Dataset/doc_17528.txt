budget at €230 million. The Culture Committee hopes this figure will be accepted by the Council and that the co-decision procedure can thus be concluded at second reading without going to conciliation. The programme will provide grants for more than 4,000 postgraduate students from non-EU countries other than the EEA/EFTA and accession countries as well as around 1,000 academics. MEPs are keen for the Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses to involve exposure to at least two EU languages. Compromise on budget for e Learning programme Mario MAURO (EPP-ED, I) Report on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on a multiannual programme (2004-2006) for the effective integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (eLearning Programme) (8642/1/2003 – C5-0293/2003 – 2002/0303(COD)) Doc.: A5-0314/2003 Procedure : Co-decision (2nd reading) Debate : 20.10.2003 The overall aim of the e Learning programme is to encourage the integration of the new information and communication technologies into European education and training systems, thereby improving their quality and accessibility. It is not designed to replace the Member States' actions in this sector, but to support and complement them. Although the Council has incorporated many of the amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading, it does not agree with MEPs' demands for a larger budget for the programme (€54 million) and has actually scaled down the €36 m originally proposed by the Commission to €33 million. At Parliament's second reading Mario MAURO (EPP-ED, I), for the Culture Committee, is tabling amendments proposing a compromise figure of €44 million which he hopes will be acceptable to the Council, thus making it possible to conclude this codecision procedure without going to conciliation. Environment More money for the protection of forests Encarnación REDONDO JIMÉNEZ (EPP-ED, E) Report on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Regulation concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus) (8243/01/03 – C5-0292/2003 – 2002/0164(COD)) Doc.: A5-0343/2003 Procedure : Co-decision (2nd reading) Debate : 20.10.2003 The proposed new scheme to monitor forests and environmental interactions follows on from two previous pieces of legislation on monitoring the impact of atmospheric pollution and of fires on forest ecosystems. In the wake of this summer's disastrous forest fires in a number of European countries, the Environment Committee is determined that the new Forest Focus programme should be given adequate funding and should place due emphasis on fire prevention measures. Rapporteur Encarnación REDONDO JIMÉNEZ (EPP-ED, E) therefore repeats Parliament's demands made at first reading for the budget for the period 2003-2006 to be increased from the proposed €52 million to €67 million and for funding to be increased proportionately in the case of accession of new Member States. MEPs have also tabled amendments designed to ensure that the new scheme continues the fire prevention measures introduced by the previous regulation.
