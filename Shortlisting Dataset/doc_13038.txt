Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (11 October 2010) Bulgaria joined the ‘Euro Plus Pact — stronger economic policy coordination for competitiveness and convergence’ at the European Council on 24/25 March 2011 and pursuant to the European Council conclusions, each participating Member State is required to present a set of specific measures to be achieved within 12 months with a view to address the goals of the Pact. In this context, the choice of the concrete policy actions necessary to achieve the common objectives remains the responsibility of each country, though it is expected that particular attention will be paid to the set of possible measures described in the Pact. The Pact also provides that countries facing major challenges in any of these areas will be identified and will have to commit to addressing these challenges in a given timeframe. The national commitments of the Bulgarian government were reflected in the National Reform Programme for 2011-2015 and the Convergence Programme for 2011-2014. In the area of fostering competitiveness, Bulgaria committed to, among other actions, review the wage-setting arrangements by introducing performance-based payment in the public sector and to review the indexation mechanisms by postponing the indexation of pensions until 2013. With a view to ensure that wage settlements in the public sector support the competitiveness efforts in the private sector, the compensation of employees in the public sector was frozen in 2011 at the 2010 level in absolute terms and is set to decline over 2011-2014 from 8.6 % to 7.9 % of GDP. Under the European Semester, the European Council recommended Bulgaria to promote, in consultation with the social partners and in accordance with national practices, policies to ensure that wage growth better reflects developments in productivity and sustain competitiveness while paying attention to ongoing convergence. In the area of enhancing the sustainability of public finances by aligning the pension system to the national demographic situation, the government committed to implement the recently agreed pension reform measures including raising the social security contribution rate, retirement age and required length of experience. Under the European Semester, the Council recommended Bulgaria to implement the agreed steps with social partners under the current pension reform, advance some of its key measures that would help to increase the effective retirement age and reduce early exit.
