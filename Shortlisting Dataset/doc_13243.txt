Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (27 June 2005) The Commission has no particular information about the issue raised by the Honourable Member. The Commission would like to recall its answer to the Honourable Member’s Written Question E‑1672/05 with regard to the fact that it is working closely with the Turkish Government to support a safe, stable, unified, prosperous and democratic Iraq that cooperates constructively with its neighbours, in line with the conclusions of the EU General Affairs Council of 21 February 2005. As repeatedly expressed at high level meetings with the Turkish authorities, including the ministerial troika held in Ankara on 7 March 2005, the Commission trusts that Turkey will remain committed to a constructive engagement with Iraq, as shown for example by its holding of the conference of Iraq's neighbours in Istanbul at the end of April. The perspective for the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey was clearly set out in the conclusions of the European Council on 17 December 2004.
