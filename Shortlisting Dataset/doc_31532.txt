Question for written answer E-5424/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (13 July 2010) Subject: Effects of the rejection of the proposal to amend Directive 2002/15/EC on public finances in the United Kingdom At its June 2010 part-session the European Parliament voted definitively to reject the Bauer report and with it the proposal to amend Directive 2002/15/EC OJ L 80, 23.3.2002, p. 35 . of the European Parliament and the Council on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities, which favoured the exclusion of self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive. Can the Commission say what costs (in terms of bureaucracy, administrative procedures, recruitment, etc.) will have to be borne by the United Kingdom's public administration in applying the directive to self-employed drivers within national territory? Has the United Kingdom already transposed the directive in question and, if not, how much is the penalty for this infringement likely to be?
