Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (17 May 2011) As part of the European Health Survey System (EHSS) http://ec.europa.eu/health/data_collection/tools/mechanisms/index_en.htm#fragment0 , Eurostat has just released early results of 13 Member States for the first round (2006‑09) of the European Health Interview Survey http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/en/hlth_ehis_esms.htm which aims at measuring — in an harmonised manner and with a high degree of comparability among Member States — the self-reported health status, health determinants and healthcare services use of the EU citizens. The survey contains questions on height and weight, physical activity, consumption of fruits, vegetables and consumption of juices. These variables can be linked with background variables on gender, age and socio economic status. The final results from this survey will feed into the list of European Community Health Indicators http://ec.europa.eu/health/indicators/echi/list/index_en.htm which will be useful to monitor obesity and overweight as well as nutritional habits amongst European citizens. As regards action for a ‘Healthy Heart’, the Commission is supporting, through the Health Programme, the European Heart Health Charter, which calls for the implementation of comprehensive health strategies and policies that promote cardiovascular health and prevent cardiovascular diseases http://www.ehnheart.org/euroheart/european-health-charter.html . This includes the European Heart Health Strategy II project which is aimed at allowing decision‑makers to develop cardiovascular diseases prevention policies based on data and scientific impact models, and at strengthening the impact of cardiovascular diseases patients' community in decision-making.
