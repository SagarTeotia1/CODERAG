assessment of the Regional Protection Programmes (RPPs) due to take place in 2009; underlines that the development of such programmes should be fully coherent with National and Regional Action Plans, the Thematic Programme on Migration and Asylum of the DCI and, more generally, should never be a means to remove responsibilities from Member States and the EU; 8. Calls on the Commission to promote greater participation by Member States in worldwide refugee resettlement efforts; 9. Welcomes the fact that the Commission recognises the need to ensure coherence with other policies that have an impact on international protection; calls therefore on the Commission to support and introduce initiatives to review and adapt all border management policies and practices such as the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) and the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) to guarantee refugees' access to protection in the EU and full respect for the principle of non-refoulement at the EU's external borders. In addition, stresses that the duty to render assistance as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is legally binding upon Member States, the EU and FRONTEX.
