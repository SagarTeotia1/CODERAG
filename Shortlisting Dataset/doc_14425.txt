Question for written answer E-002789/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Chris Davies (ALDE) (23 March 2011) Subject: Al-Arakib, Negev, Israel On 7 February Israeli bulldozers, protected by Israeli forces, demolished the Bedouin Negev village of Al-Arakib. It was the 13th time in six months that the village had been destroyed and it came just one week after a previous demolition of the village. Israel has been accused of trying to ethnically cleanse the Negev region. It is said that there is no procedure the villagers can follow in order to receive building permits for houses in their villages, which in effect makes all their homes ‘illegal’. Campaigners claim that the Israeli Government’s goal is to coerce the villagers into relocating to townships and forfeiting their lands and source of livelihood. 1. Is the Council aware of the demolitions at Al-Arakib? 2. What assurances has the Council sought from the Government of Israel with respect to that country’s human rights obligations and the rights of the Bedouin people in the Negev region? 3. Is the Council satisfied that the actions of the Israeli authorities do not undermine Article 2 of the EU‑Israel Association Agreement?
