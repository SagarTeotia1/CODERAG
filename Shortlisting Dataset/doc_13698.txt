ORAL QUESTION H-0175/02 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Anders Wijkman to the Commission Subject: Capacity-building for information and communications technologies and sustainable energy in EU development cooperation Budget line B7-623 'Capacity-building for information and communication technologies and sustainable energy' was introduced as a new line in Category 4 of the budget for 2002. According to the remarks, the 'appropriation is intended for the Commission to establish a programme within its services to support capacity-building in developing countries for ICT and sustainable energy'. Furthermore, 'the program should be well co-ordinated with other donor initiatives on ICT and sustainable energy'. In light of this, and the crucial importance of these issues in relation to EU development cooperation efforts, and given that the first quarter of 2002 will soon come to an end, what developments and actions have there been in the Commission concerning this budget line to date? How does the Commission plan to ensure the full and effective use and implementation of this budget line?
