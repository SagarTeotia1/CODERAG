Question for written answer E-6603/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (19 August 2010) Subject: BP plans to drill for oil in the Mediterranean It has been reported that the British company BP intends to start drilling for oil in the Gulf of Sirte in the Mediterranean, under an agreement signed with the Libyan government in 2007. In the light of the appalling environmental crime committed by BP in the Gulf of Mexico and the risk of a similar accident occurring in the Mediterranean as a result of new drilling activities by BP, will the Commission say: What measures will it take to protect the Mediterranean from BP’s new oil drilling operations in the region?
