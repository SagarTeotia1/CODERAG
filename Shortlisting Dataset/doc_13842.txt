expenditure; points out that this matter must be re-examined in the course of the budgetary procedure in the light of possible developments; 26. Reiterates its support for a Statute for Members' Assistants; 27. Requests that the full costs of constituency weeks be made available prior to approval of next year's calendar; 28. Welcomes Parliament's policy of advance payments on its premises; expresses its support for purchasing the Konrad Adenauer Building in Luxembourg; calls upon the Government of Luxembourg to break the current deadlock in the negotiations with Parliament concerning the possible purchase of the Konrad Adenauer Building as soon as possible; confirms its commitment to reduce its projected buildings expenditure in 2003 by EUR 24.8 m and recalls that Parliament agreed to bring these appropriations forward to the 2001 budget via Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4/2001, in order to reduce the pressure on heading 5 in 2003; Council (Section II) 29. Remains concerned at the projected expansion of the Council's budget to cater for developments under the second and third pillar in the 2003 budget; points out that these new needs were not provided for in the current financial perspective and create additional pressure on heading 5; reiterates that the compatibility of any new initiative with the current ceilings of the financial perspective ought to be examined before the budgetary authority takes a decision on the allocation of resources; 30. Agrees to continue respecting the gentlemen's agreement as far as traditional administrative expenditure is concerned, as this may facilitate a smoother budgetary procedure; underlines, however, that developments under the second and third pillar are not traditional administrative expenditure and remain excluded from the scope of the gentlemen's agreement; points out that Parliament will not hesitate to adopt amendments to the Council's section of the budget, in particular Title II, if this contributes to a global solution in heading 5; stresses that the development of the European security and defence policy should not take place at the expense of other institutions and jeopardise their enlargement preparations; Court of Justice (Section IV) 31. Takes note of the report on preparations for enlargement submitted by the Court of Justice, which concludes that an additional 112 posts will be required in the 2003 budget; considers that this is not a realistic forecast, in particular given the current constraints in heading 5; invites the Court, therefore, to scale down its budgetary projections for the 2003 budget; 32. Recalls that in December 2001 the budgetary authority authorised a transfer request amounting to EUR 2.8 million in order to front-load expenditure on the Court's buildings policy; expects the projected needs for the Court's buildings policy in the 2003 budget to be reduced by a corresponding amount; Court of Auditors (Section V) 33. Recalls the decision of the budgetary authority to front-load the financing of the second extension to the Court's premises with a total amount of EUR 7 million in the 2002 budget, in order to create additional leeway under the ceiling of heading 5 in 2003; expects the Court of Auditors, therefore, to scale down its needs
