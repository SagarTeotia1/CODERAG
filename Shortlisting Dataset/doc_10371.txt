2. Recalls that the Commission undertook a major study of the difficulties surrounding airline bankruptcy and its impact on passengers and forwarded its findings to Parliament in February 2009; 3. Notes the findings of that study and the range of options which it examines; 4. Recalls in this regard that there are a number of options which the Commission could pursue to strengthen the position of passengers of bankrupt airlines, including compulsory insurance for airlines, a voluntary insurance arrangement for passengers which airlines would be required to propose, and the establishment of a guarantee fund; 5. Calls on the Commission to examine the possibility of a legislative proposal which has as its specific objective the provision of compensation for passengers of airlines which go bankrupt and which establishes financial and administrative arrangements, including the principle of collective responsibility, whereby all airlines flying the same route with available seats would ensure repatriation for passengers who are stranded at non-home airports in the event of airline bankruptcy, and, if it considers it appropriate, to submit such a legislative proposal by 1 July 2010; asks the Commission to propose, when reviewing the Travel Package Directive, an extension for repatriation or re-routing for the passengers concerned; 6. Calls on the Commission to consider the possibility of extending such measures to airlines which have ceased operations and caused passengers similar inconvenience to that caused by airlines which go into bankruptcy; 7. Calls on the Commission to investigate the quick release of impounded aircraft by national regulatory bodies so that those aircraft can be used to bring stranded people home; 8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and governments and parliaments of the Member States.
