Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (29 September 2009) The Commission has, over recent years, been actively involved in sustainable development projects aimed at improving living standards of people in need in Tibet. The Commission concluded four grant contracts with the non-governmental organisation (NGO) ‘AP Tibet’ for development contracts in Asia in 2001/2002. During the implementation of these projects, the Commission discovered that the execution of these agreements had been transferred by AP Tibet to another entity without requesting prior approval, as required by the contracts' general conditions. Following this breach of the terms of the contracts, the Commission decided to terminate the agreements and the NGO was duly notified about this termination in December 2005. To date, the Commission has made a recovery order in 2006 for the monies paid on one of these contracts. The NGO has so far refused to repay the Commission the amount requested. The Commission has not at any time requested any repayment of legal costs. It is correct that the technical progress reports submitted by the NGO were approved for the four projects concerned, but these only covered part of the implementation period of the projects. The Commission has been in contact with the NGO and is pursuing an amicable settlement on this matter. Therefore, no actions have yet been taken in order to enforce the recovery of this debt. The Commission will continue to support NGOs that can successfully fulfil its common development objectives in third countries including Tibet.
