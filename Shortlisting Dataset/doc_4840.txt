homes, and to require Member States to take full advantage of this opportunity; 47. Regrets the complexity of much EU funding for energy efficiency, notwithstanding the existence of the Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises Initiative (JEREMIE); notes that the lack of simple and accessible funding constitutes a huge barrier for small businesses and micro-businesses in particular, which do not have the necessary capacity to access complex programmes; 48. Notes the vital importance of research and development and innovation in the area of energy efficiency; urges Member States, regional authorities, local authorities and NGOs to take advantage of the funding available under the Seventh Framework Programme, the Structural Funds and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme/Intelligent Energy Europe, which are intended to stimulate research into energy efficiency and to promote renewable energy technologies and the development of new modes of energy transport and storage designed to reduce energy losses; urges the Commission to respond generously to calls for funding for research into energy efficiency; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that energy efficiency is given high priority in the sustained efforts that are to be made to maximise the use of EU research and technology development programmes; 49. Calls for micro businesses to be treated like domestic households and offered very simple financing for energy-efficiency improvements, such as upfront grants; 50. Calls on the Commission to support state aid rules that are more favourable to energy efficiency measures (such as eco-innovation and productivity improvements); believes that such rules should be simple, practical and transparent, removing barriers to the effective implementation of energy-efficiency measures; 51. Calls on the Commission, as a matter of the utmost urgency, to put forward proposals for specific measures aimed at achieving greater energy efficiency in the outermost regions, geared to their particular characteristics resulting from the effects of the permanent constraints to which those regions are subject; 52. Stresses the role of local and regional energy agencies in the effective implementation of energy-efficient measures; calls for the involvement of all agencies (European, national and local) in the formulation and implementation of energy-efficiency action plans; Taxation 53. Calls on the Council to encourage the Member States to apply a reduced rate of value added tax on labour, materials and components which improve energy efficiency in buildings; calls on the Council to ensure that the overall tax system reflects, in a coherent way, the aim of improving energy efficiency in buildings; 54. Encourages Member States to make full use of the possibility of a reduced rate of VAT on labour in the renovation and repair of private dwellings to improve energy efficiency; welcomes the Commission's decision to evaluate the effectiveness of tax credits both for consumers buying the most energy-efficient appliances and for undertakings which produce and promote such equipment; 55. Notes that taxation falls within the competence of the Member States; notes that taxation measures chosen by Member States may be an element of all NEEAPs; advocates the internalisation of environmental costs; 56. Calls on all Member States to introduce specific incentives to
