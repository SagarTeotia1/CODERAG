Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (2 December 2005) Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement contains a number of derogations with regard to metric units of measurement OJ L 34, 9.2.2000 . , in particular for: — products and equipment already on the market and/or in service when the directive was adopted; and — components and parts of products and of equipment necessary to supplement or replace components or parts of these products and equipment. It is therefore probable and legally possible that certain products are available on Member States' markets that are labelled using imperial units of measurement. Directive 98/6/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers OJ L 80, 18.3.1998 . obliges traders to indicate the selling price and the price per unit of measurement, e.g. per kilo, per litre, etc. on all the products which they offer to consumers. The aim is to improve consumer information and facilitate price comparison. The information must be unambiguous, clearly legible and easily identifiable. If advertising mentions the selling price, it must also indicate the unit price. For products sold in bulk, only the unit price must be indicated. However, for some small retail businesses and certain types of itinerant trade, the obligation to indicate the unit price may be an excessive burden. In such cases, national authorities may stipulate that the obligation to indicate the unit price of products, other than those sold in bulk, shall not apply for a transitional period from March 2000 onwards.
