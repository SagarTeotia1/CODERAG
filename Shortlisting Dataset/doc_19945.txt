Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (24 May 2005) As the Honourable Member is aware, the European Council has decided that full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a pre-condition for opening accession negotiations with Croatia. Following discussions in the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 16 March 2005, it was concluded that the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia, foreseen for 17 March 2005, would be postponed. The Commission and the Member States are in close contact with the ICTY on the issue of Croatia’s cooperation with the Tribunal. It is of course for the Council to determine whether cooperation is full or not. This is not a matter of just one indicted General, but a question of whether the state apparatus is fully able and willing to implement international obligations. Meanwhile it is first and foremost the responsibility of the Croatian Government to locate, arrest and transfer Croatian indictees.
