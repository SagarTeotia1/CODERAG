Answer given by Mr Orban on behalf of the Commission (15 September 2008) The Commission is aware of the importance of language learning in fostering intercultural dialogue and promoting Europe’s external relations. The core objective of this external dimension of the European multilingualism policy is to promote the teaching and learning of European languages abroad and of non-EU languages in Europe through exchanges of expertise, good practice and joint stakeholder groups. The Commission policy objective is to promote all official languages on an equal footing. The Commission does not intend to create distinctions between European languages for whatever reason. By promoting language teaching and linguistic diversity in an all encompassing way and by not focusing on any specific language, this policy enhances the opportunities for an ample and fruitful intercultural dialogue with partner countries and regions and fosters cultural and linguistic links with other parts of the world.
