Question for written answer P-5446/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) (8 July 2010) Subject: Effectiveness and impact of debt arrangements for over-indebted individuals The ever-increasing number of over-indebted borrowers and households unable to pay off their debts in the midst of the economic recession is becoming a key issue with a severe socioeconomic impact on the Member States. In an attempt to tackle the problem and provide a possible solution for over-indebted consumers living in difficult conditions, some countries have implemented measures intended to alleviate or even discharge the debts of over-indebted people with a proven inability to repay them. Given that arrangements of this kind have been adopted to date by a large number of Member States (Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, etc.), while similar measures are about to be put to the vote in other countries, including Greece, can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. In the Member States which apply the measure, what are the basic terms and preconditions for including the people concerned in the debt settlement arrangements? What types of debt are included in these arrangements (consumer loans, mortgages, debts to third parties, debts to public bodies, etc)? Is there provision for liquidation of debtors’ assets? 2. Are there any quantitative data available with regard to the impact that these arrangements have had in the Member States which apply them, such as the number of participants in the programme, the amount of money involved, etc? 3. Are there any quantitative and qualitative data available to confirm the effectiveness of the programme (success rate, rate of actual implementation of the arrangements)? 4. In the context of the procedures laid down in the Member States, which bodies take on the role of intermediary between consumers and creditors?
