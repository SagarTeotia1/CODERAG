WRITTEN QUESTION E-3590/08 by Emmanouil Angelakas (PPE-DE) to the Commission (25 June 2008) Subject: Parallel exports of pharmaceutical preparations and the social security system Within the European Union the same pharmaceutical products produced by the same company which are normally patent-protected and considered innovative are being sold at prices which very often differ significantly from one Member State to another. Over the last few years parallel exports of such products have substantially increased and their value is enormous. Community law allows the circulation of such products according to the rules governing the single market. The profit from parallel exports and price differences remains exclusively in the hands of exporters and importers (wholesale pharmaceutical businesses), no part of this profit being passed onto patients/consumers or the insurance funds. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Given that the final price at which pharmaceutical products are sold to patients is stable and fixed regardless of provenance (regular marketing by the pharmaceuticals company or parallel import), is the Commission considering setting up a system for returning part of the profit percentage (rebate) to the insurance funds from pharmaceutical preparations which circulate with parallel exports so that European citizens derive at least some financial benefit? 2. It has been noted that in some Member States defects have occasionally been observed in pharmaceutical preparations circulating with parallel exports, for obvious reasons. What measures is the Commission taking to protect European citizens from such defects?
