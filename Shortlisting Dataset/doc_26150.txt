Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (10 November 2005) As the Honourable Member states, the United Kingdom authorities do not plan to reduce excise duties on petroleum products. The Commission would point out in this respect that it is for the national authorities, acting under their own responsibility, to set fuel tax in line with economic needs and budgetary requirements, while complying with Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity OJ L 283, 31.10.2003 . . This directive in particular lays down Community minimum rates which are defined according to type of product and the use made of it. Whatever national measure is proposed, the Member State concerned must notify it to the Commission if it is likely to constitute State aid so that the Commission can evaluate the compatibility of the measure with the common market. While the national authorities may grant reductions for specific sectors, such as the agricultural sector or road haulage companies, in compliance with the abovementioned directive, the Commission is not generally in favour of unilateral measures. Offsetting an oil price rise by reducing taxes ultimately transfers budgetary revenue to the oil-producing countries, which are encouraged to keep their prices high as they need not fear a fall in demand. Such an approach would also run counter to our environmental objectives. Uncoordinated tax cuts are also likely to disturb the smooth functioning of the internal market. As far as diesel is concerned, Member States can distinguish between two rates of excise duty for diesel depending on whether or not the diesel is used for commercial purposes. So far only France and Belgium have made use of the possibility of distinguishing according to the use made of the fuel. The Commission is still considering ways of harmonising excise duty on commercial diesel at European level.
