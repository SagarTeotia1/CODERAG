Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (4 February 2008) Community legislation Council Directive 91/692/EEC of 23 December 1991 standardising and rationalizing reports on the implementation of certain Directives relating to the environment, OJ 377, 31.12.1991 . contains many reporting obligations for Member States, but it does not specifically require Member States to report to the Commission how many gypsum cells they have set up. Therefore, the Commission does not have this specific information. The Commission is proactively promoting the creation of the European recycling society. To this end, a number of measures have already been and will further be undertaken in the context of the implementation of the Thematic Strategy on Waste Prevention and Recycling COM(2005)666 final, http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/strategy.htm . As the first step, the Commission will modernise, clarify and simplify the waste legislation, starting with the revision of Directive 2006/12/EC on waste OJ L 114, 27.4.2006. . The revision of this directive will provide a sound legal basis for the operation of various recycling industries by introducing a definition of recycling, clarifying definitions of reuse, recovery and disposal, introducing a clear five step waste hierarchy and proposing a mechanism to clarify when certain wastes cease to be waste and become products to be traded freely within the Internal Market. In addition, the development of common standards in waste management (e.g. establishing minimum treatment standards for waste management operations in order to secure safe and high quality recycling) was brought forward with the proposal for the revision of Directive 96/61/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC Directive) OJ L 257, 10.10.1996. clarifying the current scope of the directive as regards the waste sector and including additional waste management activities (e.g. treatment of biological waste, slags, ashes and scrap metal) which will have to operate according to best available techniques. The issue of recycling of wastes coming from the construction and demolition sector (including gypsum) will be subject to discussions between Parliament and the Council in the context of the second reading of Directive 2006/12/EC on waste, and, in particular, as regards the recycling target of 70 % for this waste stream proposed by Parliament. The treatment of gypsum waste is subject to the requirements of Directive 2006/12/EC on waste and Directive 1999/31/EC OJ L 182, 16.7.1999. on the landfill of waste together with Council Decision 2003/33/EC OJ L 11, 16.1.2003. on acceptance criteria in landfills. According to Directive 2006/12/EC, waste should be recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment. It follows from Article 6 of Directive 1999/31/EC that only waste that has been subject to treatment is landfilled. This provision may not apply in cases regarding inert waste for which treatment is not technically feasible, nor to other waste for which such treatment does not contribute to the abovementioned objectives of Directive 2006/12/EC. Provision 2.2.3 of Decision 2003/33/EC lays down specific technical requirements for the acceptance of gypsum waste in landfills, such as its disposal in cells isolated from biodegradable waste in landfills for non-hazardous waste.
