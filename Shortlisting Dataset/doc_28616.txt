and Control becomes fully and effectively operational without any further delay, especially given the threat of communicable diseases, the potential of a pending influenza epidemic and the rapid increase in multi-drug resistant diseases, especially AIDS and tuberculosis; 51. Stresses that citizens must be afforded adequate protection by reducing the risk of natural disasters and environmental or health crises by means of early-warning and immediate-response mechanisms and long-term prevention; 52. Emphasises that the Commission must ensure a proper follow-up to its communication on a European Programme on Nutrition and Health, proposing concrete actions to fight obesity, poor diet, lack of exercise, and misuse of drugs and alcohol, which all lead to diabetes and heart disease problems; 53. Urges the Commission to place a strong emphasis, in the framework of the 7th Research Framework Programme, on intensified research into new/alternative medication to fight HIV/AIDS; 54. Calls on the Commission to put forward, and on the Member States to decide upon, a timetable for the development of a coherent policy on patient mobility, with the aim of developing clear rules on the reimbursement of medical expenses for treatments received in a Member State other than the one in which a patient is insured; Consumer protection 55. Stresses the importance of clear, simple and safe rules for both consumers and producers within the single market, and accordingly suggests a further simplification of rules for trans-border contracts, in particular; believes, in this context, that consumer protection legislation should as a matter of principle follow the new approach consisting of minimum standards and mutual recognition; 56. Does not consider it appropriate to combine in one strategy both consumer and health policies, when the current consumer policy strategy and public health programme expire (in 2007 and 2008 respectively); firmly believes that, whilst these two policies should follow the same political guidelines, both need their own strategies and budgets; A stronger Europe in a safer world Enlargement 57. Expects a steady and determined development of the Union's common foreign, security and defence policies with a view to projecting European values on the world stage and to defending the EU's common interest in international affairs; puts great emphasis on the need to reach rapid agreement on setting up the joint external action service in a way that protects the prerogatives of the Commission and Parliament, engages national diplomacies and provides the Union's Foreign Minister with the resources, intelligence and instruments he will need to function well; 58. Requests that the Commission keep Parliament fully informed, in detail, of progress in coming months in the preparation of enlargement negotiations with both Croatia and Turkey; 59. Believes that, while entering the active phase of negotiations with Croatia (on the basis of the mandate soon to be communicated by the Commission), the Stabilisation and Association Process should be pursued and extended as a policy corner-stone for relations with the Western Balkans; Neighbourhood policy 60. Underlines the high priority it attaches to the implementation of a comprehensive neighbourhood policy, aimed at developing a sphere of democracy, stability and prosperity in the countries bordering the Union
