Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (12 August 2011) Since the beginning of the financial assistance to Greece, the Commission has published quarterly compliance reports. These reports elaborate in detail on each of the policy commitments and identify the reforms that have been adopted and implemented, and those that have been adopted with defficiencies or with delay. The Honourable Member is referred to the latest version of the compliance report which is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2011/pdf/ocp82_en.pdf The Commission is aware of anecdotal evidence of pensions paid to deceased people and fraud in disability pensions. The medium-term fiscal strategy through 2015, which was discussed with the Commission/European Central Bank/International Monetary Fund staff teams in May and June 2011 and adopted by the Greek Parliament in June 2011, includes measures to reform the disability pension system, and a census of pensioners and cross-checking of personal data.
