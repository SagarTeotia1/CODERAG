ORAL QUESTION H-0790/08 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Konstantinos Droutsas to the Council Subject: Compliance by Turkey with international law Over the last few days the Turkish military has once more been sending war planes to bomb the Avasin-Basyan area of Northern Iraq, thereby racking up the tension along the border between the two countries and breaching the principle of border inviolability embodied in international law, with devastating consequences for the local populace. Does the Council condemn these fresh attacks by Turkey on the territory of another country, which constitute an infringement of the inviolability of borders, a principle embodied in international law?
