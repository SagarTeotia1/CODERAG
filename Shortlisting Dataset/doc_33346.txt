9999/C Q999 E/034 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0432/04 by Helle Thorning-Schmidt (PSE) to the Commission (05 February 2004) Subject: Passive smoking The Commission has repeatedly stated that passive smoking is a health problem. Much research into the matter has shown that people who are exposed to passive smoking, particularly at work, can suffer serious health problems. Does the Commission agree that passive smoking is not only a health problem but also a problem associated with the working environment? Will the Commission submit proposals for legislation to protect workers against the health risks caused by smoking in the work-place? If so, how will the Commission proceed and what is the timetable for any such measures?
