with the US authorities in order to find an appropriate solution. In this regard, the Commission is examining whether accession to the Safe Harbor by SWIFT would be sufficient to legitimate the transfers of personal data to its mirror server in the US under the Safe Harbor Decision. Adherence to the Safe Harbor would be combined with assurances given by the US Treasury Department that would demonstrate that US Treasury processing of SWIFT data is proportionate and takes full account of EU data protection principles. As stated in the abovementioned letters, the Council Presidency and the Commission will regularly inform both the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the progress of any future negotiations with US Treasury Department on these matters.
