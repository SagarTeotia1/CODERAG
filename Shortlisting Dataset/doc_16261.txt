MEPs in the committee propose a wide range of measures, including a European donor card, to tackle problems like organ shortage, transplantation risks and organ trafficking. Although the use of human organs for transplantation has steadily increased in recent years across the EU, the number of people requiring a transplant is still greater than the number of organs available for transplant. The own-initiative report drafted by Adamos Adamou (GUE/NGL, CY) recalls that currently many thousands of patients in Europe, with a significant mortality rate, are registered on waiting lists. Organ donation has to remain “strictly non-commercial” The committee stresses that organ donation must stay “strictly non-commercial” and should be made altruistically and voluntarily, ruling out payments between donors and recipients. Compensation should be possible only to make good expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. “Any commercial exploitation of organs is unethical and inconsistent with the most basic human values”, and organ donation out of financial motivation “degrades the gift of an organ to a mere commodity which constitutes a violation of human dignity”, say MEPs in the committee. Prevent organ trafficking and "transplant tourism" The report stresses that “organ trafficking undermines the credibility of the system for potential voluntary and unpaid donors”. The Commission and Member States are asked to take measures to prevent "transplant tourism", including drawing up guidelines to protect the poorest and most vulnerable donors from being victims of organ trafficking and adopting measures that increase the availability of legally procured organs. Moreover, Member States should take the necessary measures to prevent insurance companies reimbursing costs incurred in obtaining illegal organ transplantation. A European donor card The committee proposes to introduce a European donor card, complementary to existing national systems. MEPs in the committee also note that those who are not suitable donors should be encouraged to carry a card to that effect as well in order to facilitate a swift identification of organs. Additionally, Member States should make it possible to appoint a legal representative who can decide on donation after one's death, states the report. Organ sharing and new biotechnology to tackle organ shortage Establishing well-structured operational systems and promoting successful models in and between Member States and at international level is of “utmost importance” to fight organ shortage more effectively, say MEPs in the committee. They call on the Commission to promote research in biotechnology which, in the future, “may offer the possibility for researchers to grow organs from existing tissues and cells, either from the patients themselves or from other tissue donors”. MEPs in the committee support reinforced cooperation between Member States leading to increased organ sharing between EU Member States. In particular small Member States with a limited donor pool could clearly benefit from European co-operation, says the report. The Commission should, therefore, facilitate alliances
