Question for written answer E-012643/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kay Swinburne (ECR) (11 January 2012) Subject: Continued non-compliance with the EU Zoo Directive — 1999/22/EC A number of constituents have contacted me regarding the continued non-compliance with the EU Zoo Directive (1999/22/EC) by a number of Member States. Inquiries by the Born Free Foundation have highlighted that many zoos across the EU are substandard and do not meet EU animal welfare standards. I am concerned that, despite a European Court of Justice ruling in December 2010 that the Commission should take immediate action against those Member States that had not complied with the directive, and despite this concern having been raised by a number of MEPs, non-compliance still remains an issue almost a year later. It would therefore be helpful if the Commission could provide an update as to: 1. Which EU Member States are still non-compliant with this directive? 2. What action will the Commission be taking? 3. What deadline has the Commission set for non-compliant Member States to rectify this grave situation?
