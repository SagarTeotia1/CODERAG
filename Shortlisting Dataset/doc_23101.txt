WRITTEN QUESTION E-3308/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (13 June 2008) Subject: Alternative ways of conducting the EU institutions' meetings Every week, thousands of individuals (MEPs and some of their assistants, Member State officials, etc.) travel to Brussels (or to Strasbourg) in order to attend meetings at the EU institutions. All this travelling is economically very expensive and environmentally damaging. In many cases the required attendance is merely a presence of a few minutes at one or two committee meetings. Has the Commission looked into alternative ways of conducting some of the EU institutions’ meetings that do not require the physical presence of all individuals in one place? For example, has it looked into the possibility of holding meetings through a well designed, modern system of teleconferencing?
