Preliminary answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (20 June 2007) The Commission will analyse the recent assessment of the current state of implementation of the ELV Directive by Member States prepared, in March 2007, by the Institute for European Environmental Policy at the request of the Parliament’s Environment Committee. Based on this analysis, as well as on the information provided by Member States pursuant to Article 9(1) of Directive 2000/53/EC OJ L 269, 21.10.2000 . of 18 September 2000 on end-of-life vehicles, the Commission will decide what action to take against any possible incorrect implementation of the ELV Directive. While it is impossible to state, at this stage, what particular action will be required for each individual Member State, the Commission services will keep the Honourable Member informed of the steps undertaken.
