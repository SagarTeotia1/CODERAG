Recalls the principle of gender mainstreaming as enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, whereby a gender equality perspective does not only apply to measures designed specifically to promote equal opportunities but should be incorporated in all policies and at all levels of the budgetary process by means of gender budgeting; 2. Notes that its resolution from 3 July 2003 on gender budgeting, building public budgets from a gender perspective OJ C 74 E, 24.3.2004, p. 746. addressed the fact that public budgets, including the EU budget, are not gender-neutral and have a different impact on women and men; 3 . Stresses that the Commission should develop a monitoring and evaluation system that shows the effects on men and women of various budget lines in terms of implementing the principle of gender equality; 4. Reiterates the call for the use of the gender budgeting approach to assess and restructure all pertinent budget programmes, measures and policies, determine to what extent resources are allocated in gender equal or unequal ways and ultimately achieve gender neutrality, where equal consideration is given regardless of gender; 5. Regrets that, as a result of the restructuring of Title 04 Employment and social affairs , the chapter Equal opportunities for women and men is not retained as a separate item and there is no longer any reference to the issue; believes that the new designation of Chapter 04 04 Employment and social solidarity will diminish the authority and visibility of gender equality issues; therefore suggests that the heading of the new Chapter 04 04 should include a reference to gender equality; 6. Stresses that the budget should reflect the strategies set out in the Beijing Platform for Action and the Lisbon Strategy so as to achieve a balanced representation of women among social partners, increased involvement of women in economic decision-making and increased access for women both to education and to actions and programmes relating to research, technology and the information society; 7. Considers that one of the priorities of the EU budget for 2007 is the need to take account of the enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria and the re-allocation of a number of key budget lines; stresses the need to ensure that they will have full access to programmes covering gender equality and women's rights issues; 8.
