WRITTEN QUESTION E-3116/07 by Cristian Silviu Buşoi (ALDE) and Horia-Victor Toma (ALDE) to the Commission (21 June 2007) Subject: Examination centres for EPSO Competitions Romania is a relatively large European country, with 237 500 square kilometres and a transport infrastructure that needs further improvement. EPSO has organised one test centre for its competitions in Bucharest. 1. Is the Commission aware that to sit an exam many candidates must travel long distances to Bucharest by train which often takes more than 9‑10 hours, and sometimes even 12 hours? 2. Does the Commission not think that this is discriminatory to many young European citizens who have to be able to focus during a long and difficult examination, while in other EU countries, such as Germany or France, there are three examination centres and the transport infrastructure enables a much shorter travelling time? 3. Does the Commission not think it would be feasible to open one other examination centre in Romania, so as to ensure that more candidates are able to sit admission tests after spending less time travelling?
