Question for written answer E-000864/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sonia Alfano (ALDE) (9 February 2011) Subject: Repeal of offences connected with adulterated foodstuffs Italy’s Law No 246 of 28 November 2005 slashed the number of laws by repealing all legislation prior to 1 January 1970 that was not deemed indispensable to the functioning of the national legislative system. Law No 283 of 30 April 1962, which established hygiene requirements for the production and sale of foodstuffs and beverages, was one of the laws deemed not indispensable and so repealed, notably along with the penalties provided for in Articles 5, 6 and 12 of said law. As a result, offences relating to adulterated food (for example, the use for purposes of sale or distribution of foodstuffs in a poor state of preservation, foodstuffs with a specific germ count or foodstuffs that are clearly spoiled, and the introduction into the country of foodstuffs that do not meet the minimum hygiene standards laid down by law) are no longer punishable by law in Italy. It is obvious — as some magistrates have also pointed out — that with no penalties for offences of this kind, the health of millions of people in the EU is put at risk and people committing offences that impact heavily on society are guaranteed impunity. 1. Was the Commission aware that this legislative vacuum had been created in Italy? 2. Does it consider the legislation currently in force in Italy compatible with EU legislation? 3. Is the Commission intending to ask the Italian authorities for information on this matter?
