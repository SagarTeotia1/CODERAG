MEPs back by a large majority a report that supports the new Lisbon Treaty as a step forward for democracy and transparency. A few Members spoke against the Treaty and called for referenda in individual states. The independence of Kosovo was another hot topic of the day, with a debate and declarations by the Council and the Commission. MEPs also debated the application of community law and the demographic future of the EU. On Wednesday morning, British Labour MEP Richard Corbett and Spanish EPP-ED Member Íñigo Méndez de Vigo presented their report on the Treaty of Lisbon. An overwhelming majority of MEPs expressed their support for the new Treaty, which they believe will enhance the EU's democratic accountability, protect citizens' rights and improve the functioning of EU institutions.
