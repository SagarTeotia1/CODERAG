Answer given by Baroness Ashton on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2010) This subject is primarily dealt with in the context of the local EU‑India Human Rights Dialogue. It was raised at the last Dialogue meeting held in New Delhi on 27 February 2009, when the Indian Government acknowledged that while the necessary legal framework indeed exists, the problem lies rather in the implementation of the law. There will in principle be another Dialogue meeting in the first quarter of 2010 when the subject will again be raised. The European Commission will continue to insist that the Communal Violence and Control Bill be adopted, and that the role played by the Commission for Minorities be reinforced. A fact-finding visit to Orissa by EU Heads of Mission had been planned for December 2009 but was deferred, and is now planned for early February 2010. The visit will include the district of Kandhamal, which has been at the epicentre of the violence. In addition to raising this subject on-the-spot the European Commission will also continue to raise it with the central government, albeit in the knowledge that the federal structure of India’s government means that law and order issues are constitutionally the responsibility of the state governments.
