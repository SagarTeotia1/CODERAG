human and fundamental rights, and with respect to Community law on public procurement: – the inclusion in the new law of a clear definition of 'public interest' which unambiguously prevents the possibility that the "public interest" justification for expropriation – which is a precondition for any expropriation under European human and fundamental rights legislation – could be used for the promotion of private, rather than public, interests, – the establishment of binding criteria for the calculation of compensation in cases of expropriation on the basis of the standards and principles recognised by the case-law of the ECJ and ECHR, – fundamental review of the bases for selecting the "development agent", and of the procedure for awarding public contracts to the "development agent" selected, to ensure that such a function is compatible with European law, given the existence of serious doubts on this subject as evidenced by the current infringement proceedings, so as to enhance the transparency of the procedure for awarding public contracts and to safeguard the property rights of European citizens, – measures to ensure that each land owner concerned by any development plans is informed individually, effectively and in good time of any plan, and any aspect thereof, which might affect his or her property and fundamental rights, so as to guarantee an adequate possibility to consider appropriate action; 7.

Insists that claims offices be set up, under the responsibility of the local authorities and the Valencian Regional Government, to provide assistance for people affected by the LRAU in administrative terms, supplying them with all the information required to enable them to consider the advisability of any legal action; 11. Is concerned about the risks associated with the development of projects that have already been decided although not yet started and about their possible consequences (it does appear that there is some haste to enter into new projects before promulgation of the new law which will necessarily seem more restrictive) and insists, as a matter of urgency on the need to suspend the processing and approval of
