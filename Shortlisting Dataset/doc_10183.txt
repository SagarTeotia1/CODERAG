Question for written answer E-5875/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (26 July 2010) Subject: Greenhouse gas emissions According to the Barilla Centre for Food and Nutrition, farming is responsible for 33% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, a percentage which has increased significantly in recent years. Food is said to be responsible for 25% of each individual's carbon footprint and so agri-foodstuffs consumption needs to be limited in order to maintain a balance between consumption and production. The same stance has been taken by the president of the Global Footprint Network, who is concerned at excessive agri-foodstuffs consumption and has said that ecosystems are our main source of wealth and, in a world with limited biocapacity, neglect of these issues could lead to a collapse of the system. In the light of the above, what measures will the Commission adopt within the framework of CAP reform in order to limit greenhouse gas emissions?
