WRITTEN QUESTION E-1554/07 by Johan Van Hecke (ALDE) to the Commission (26 March 2007) Subject: Out-of-court settlement of the Trafigura case with Côte d'Ivoire The owner of the toxic waste-carrying vessel the Probo Koala, the Dutch oil trading company Trafigura, has reached an out-of-court settlement with the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and is paying EUR 150 million in compensation for having dumped toxic waste in the port of Abijan. At least 10 people died as a result of that incident. However, Trafigura continues to deny all liability. According to it, the waste which was delivered in August 2006 was not toxic, although the UN found that it contained chemicals which are fatal in high concentrations. President Gbagbo of Côte d'Ivoire expressed satisfaction with the out-of-court settlement: ‘It is a good agreement which allows the state to compensate the victims,’ he said after the signing of the agreement. What is the Commission's view of this out-of-court settlement? Will there be a European inquiry into the transport of toxic waste to Third World countries? Does the Commission consider that Trafigura should still be punished in Europe for this illegal transportation of waste? Will measures be taken from the EU to prevent such practices in future?
