Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (2 June 2010) The EU policy of promoting renewable energy, including biofuels, is based on the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase security of supply and increase competitiveness. To this end, the directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources Directive 2009/28/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC, OJ L 140, 5.6.2009. contains amongst others an overall binding target of 20 % renewable energy in the EU's gross final consumption of energy by 2020 and, as noted by the Honourable Member, a specific binding target of 10 % renewable energy in transport for 2020 Article 3 of Directive 2009/28/EC. . Biofuels are expected to contribute to reaching both these targets. Concerning question 1, it is the Commission's assessment that to date the contribution of biofuels has been positive. The Commission is however aware of the concerns that have been raised in relation to the use of biofuels and shares the Honourable Member's view that is important to ensure that these do not become reality and conflict with the EU's environmental, social and economic goals. That is why the directive contains a pioneering sustainability scheme for biofuels, requiring notably that Articles 17.1 to 17.5 of Directive 2009/28/EC. : — biofuels achieve a minimum level of greenhouse gas emission saving of 35 % (rising to 50 % in 2017, and to 60 % in 2018 for new installations); — biofuels are not made from raw materials taken from high biodiversity value land or high carbon stock land. Economic operators are required by the directive to submit to Member States information on compliance with these criteria and on other environmental and social matters Article 18.3 § 2 of Directive 2009/28/EC. . This information will be published, in aggregated form, on the Commission's transparency platform Article 18.3 § 5 of Directive 2009/28/EC. . Concerning question 2, the Commission shares the view that organic waste should play an important role in renewable energy development (in other sectors and indeed also in transport) in the coming years. The directive's overall targets for renewable energy use will certainly encourage a significant increase in their use in the electricity and heating sectors. Regarding transport, under the directive, it is for Member States to decide on how the 10 % target will be achieved at national level. However, it is worth highlighting that the directive provides incentives for certain renewable energy sources in transport. In particular, the contribution made by biofuels from waste, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material is considered to be twice that made by other biofuels Article 21.2 of Directive 2009/28/EC. . The Commission expects these incentives to encourage solid waste uses. The National Renewable Energy Action Plans, which Member States must submit to the Commission by 30 June 2010, provide detailed estimates from Member States regarding the expected contribution from various renewable energy sources by 2020,
