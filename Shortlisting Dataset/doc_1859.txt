Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (24 April 2009) The Commission is aware that Kent International Gateway Ltd (KIG) has submitted a planning application to Maidstone Borough Council as the Local Planning Authority. This is an outline planning application for a rail/road freight interchange incorporating buildings for warehousing and distribution and offices, research and development and light industrial units, on 112 hectares west of M20 Bearsted/Hollingbourne. The application is being considered using appropriate United Kingdom planning legislation. This project would appear to be a purely private sector development. No European funding has been invested into this project or is planned in the future.
