WRITTEN QUESTION E-1367/05 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (12 April 2005) Subject: Prevention and training against drugs A dangerous new trend has appeared in recent years among young people, namely the taking of various types of drugs at the same time, including cocaine, methadone, ecstasy, ketamine, inhaled heroin, viagra, mixed with abundant quantities of alcohol. The problem mainly affects youngsters between the ages of 17 and 23. It has devastating effects: mental disorders, hallucinations, fits of violence lasting 24 to 48 hours, persecution complexes and paranoia symptoms. Those who take such cocktails generally fail to realise that the serious health risks involved and are unlikely to seek medical assistance unless a serious disorder arises. 1. Does the Commission not consider that it should promote information campaigns to make very young people who are given the possibility of taking such drugs more aware of the dangers they face? 2. Given that the organisations responsible for tackling this problem by treating and assisting the young people affected require highly specialised personnel, does it not consider it necessary to finance training courses and make funds available to help establish specialist treatment centres for such disorders, which particularly affect young people?
