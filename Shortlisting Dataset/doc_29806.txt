States concerned and is prepared to examine as a matter of urgency the possibilities to release the 4% performance reserve for the countries concerned; urges that flood-related destruction of cross-border infrastructure between the Member States and the applicant countries concerned likewise be adequately addressed; 12. Is of the opinion that the floods constitute force majeure which should lead to commitment appropriations which are decommitted under the ‘n+2 rule’ being made available again, including for applicant countries; 13. Agrees with the 50 % advance on arable payments to farmers in flooded regions, the making available of intervention stocks and the authorisation of the use of set-aside land for farmers in flood-affected regions as well as releasing not yet allocated funds under the TEN-transport and TEN-Energy budgets; 14. Welcomes the allocation of unallocated ISPA funds for the Czech Republic and Slovakia and agrees with the making available of the PHARE reserve for 2003 under more flexible conditions; recommends that long-term investment support should be made available for applicant countries by linking the implementation of the proposed relief funds to the future structural funds; 15. Welcomes the EIB ‘Flood Disaster Plan’ to make available this year EUR 1 billion for 30-year loans on the most generous terms, exceptionally financing up to 100 % of the costs of individual projects including SMEs; 16. Agrees in principle with the idea of creating a Disaster Relief Fund whose appropriations will only be called upon in case of a major disaster but stresses that further discussion is needed between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament on the eligibility criteria and technical and financial arrangements applicable to such a fund, so that the Fund can fulfil legitimate expectations; 17. Recalls that the EP abolished the previous budget line for natural disasters for a lack of clear criteria and funds available for this line; 18. Calls on the Commission and the Council in this respect to give serious consideration to the possibility of ‘mopping up’ unused commitment appropriations of all categories of expenditure at the end of the financial year, channelling them into such a Disaster Relief Fund and carrying them over to the next years, so as to create a cumulative Fund; 19. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Governments of Austria, Germany and the appropriate applicant countries.
