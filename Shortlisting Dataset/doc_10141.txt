: Codecision (1st reading) Vote : 20.04.2004 Vote Parliament adopted a first reading compromise deal with the Council on a directive which is part of an integrated package of measures designed to combat air pollution in the EU. The compromise has been in the making for some months with Hans KRONBERGER (IND, A) in lead as the rapporteur for the Environment Committee. The aim of the directive is to regulate and minimise arsenic, cadmium, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air. In the Committee vote in January wanted to set limit values, rather than just monitoring requirements as proposed by the Commission, for these air pollutants. The compromise adopted by the whole House sets target values for these pollutants - neither just monitoring requirements nor binding limit values. The target values will have to be met, where possible, by 2012. The agreed date is a compromise between 2010 as proposed by the Environment Committee and 2014 proposed earlier by the Council Presidency. Furthermore the Parliament managed to get a provision to the deal which requires the Commission to consider the possible merit in introducing limit values in a report that is due in 2010.

The guiding principles that the Parliament wanted to add to the eco-design rules for energy-using products were clarity, better consumer information and transparency. The Parliament backed its rapporteur Astrid THORS (ELDR, FIN) and said that the directive was too vaguely worded and should contain more detailed requirements. MEPs also want new rules to give consumers more information about their dishwashers and other energy-using products. Compromise negotiations with the Council took place after the vote in the Committee on Environment and Public Health in mid-March but they fell apart. However, the Commissioner for Transport and Energy, Loyola de PALACIO stated in the parliamentary debate that the Council view is not too far from the Parliament's position so an agreement should be in sight for the second
