ORAL QUESTION H-0374/07 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Nils Lundgren to the Council Subject: Gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea There are varying reports as to whether the Council has approved the construction of a German-Russian gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea. It is important - particularly from a democratic perspective - that the public receives an answer on this matter. I have discussed the matter previously with both the Commission and the Council without receiving specific and satisfactory information. Has the Council formally approved the construction of a German-Russian gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea? The Council's approval is presumably required to enable the project to go ahead? Should a dispute arise over environmental impact assessment in Swedish waters, is it the European Court of Justice or the Swedish Environmental Court which passes final judgment in the case?
