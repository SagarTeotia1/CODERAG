ORAL QUESTION H-0887/02 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Ewa Hedkvist Petersen to the Commission Subject: Alcohol lock on cars Each year, 42 000 people lose their lives on the EU's roads. Many road accidents, in all countries, occur because the driver is under the influence of alcohol. We must use advances in technology to prevent drink-driving. Several trials with alcohol locks are being conducted in Sweden and 90% of the population says that they are in favour of them. The locks are a technical device which can test the driver's alcohol level and block the vehicle if the level is over the limit. What is the Commission's view of alcohol locks on vehicles as a step towards greater road safety?
