WRITTEN QUESTION E-2851/10 by Sergio Berlato (PPE) to the Commission (29 April 2010) Subject: ‘Voiturettes’ illegally modified to make them faster ‘Voiturettes’ or motor quadricycles, legally classed as mopeds, are increasingly common in Europe. 6 499 of these small cars were sold in Italy in 2009, compared with 6 201 in 2008, while in France — where the ‘voiturette’ was launched in the early 1980s — the number of sales has reached 14 620. Following the tragic road accidents that have occurred in recent months, in which teenagers have lost their lives while driving ‘voiturettes’, questions are being raised about the safety of such cars. These vehicles, which are now finding favour with senior citizens (24 % of sales) and workers (21 %), were in fact designed to save young people from the dangers of moped accidents; in the meantime, however, the illegal practice of removing the restrictor to make them faster has become common. ‘Voiturettes’ are designed to travel at speeds of no more than 45 kilometres per hour, but with just a few minor engine modifications they can reach speeds of 80 to 100 kilometres per hour — a speed well above the maximum laid down by law for this type of vehicle, making them potentially dangerous on the roads. In the light of the situation outlined above, does the Commission not think it should introduce a programme of inspections designed to prevent the modification of ‘voiturette’ engines and the ensuing risk to drivers, passengers and pedestrians? In addition, given that a person can drive a ‘voiturette’ simply by passing a theory test in order to obtain a provisional licence, does the Commission not think it should also introduce new precautionary regulations to keep Europeans safe on the roads?
