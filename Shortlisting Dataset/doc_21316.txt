Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (13 February 2009) The Commission has followed the events which took place in the Czech Republic in October 2008 and has taken note of the prompt and effective reaction of the authorities which successfully managed to protect the attacked Roma people from the aggressors. The Commission strongly condemns any discrimination against Roma people and is firmly committed, together with Member States, to fight the exclusion Roma people face in many Member States. The Commission has also repeatedly condemned and rejected all manifestations of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, as these repugnant phenomena are incompatible with the principles upon which the EU is based.
