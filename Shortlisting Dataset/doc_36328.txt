Question for written answer E-002396/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sebastian Valentin Bodu (PPE) (14 March 2011) Subject: Laissez-passer Article 6 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities states that laissez‑passer shall be recognised by the authorities of the Member States. Under sub‑paragraph two of that Article, the Commission may conclude agreements for those laissez-passer to be recognised as valid travel documents within the territory of third countries. 1. Why do situations arise in which border police — passport control — officials in Member States do not accept the laissez‑passer as a valid travel document, and how this can be remedied so that these passes are worth having? 2. Which third countries has the Commission concluded such agreements with to date, and has it ensured that holders of laissez‑passer do not encounter problems when they want to use them?
