Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2008) Under the Community rules on the coordination of social security (Regulation (EC) No 1408/71 Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of the Council of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community, OJ L 149, 5.7.1971. ), an individual is normally subject to the social security legislation of the Member State where he is working. An EU citizen working in Ireland is therefore entitled to Irish family benefit. Under Article 73 of Regulation (EC) No 1408/71, persons subject to the legislation of a Member State are entitled to family benefit in respect of their children who live in another Member State. According to the Commission's information, the Irish Early Childcare Supplement is considered to be a family benefit for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1408/71. Persons employed in Ireland may therefore claim that benefit for members of their family who reside in another Member State.
