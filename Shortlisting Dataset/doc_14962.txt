Question for written answer E-001430/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President/High Representative) Rule 117 Sir Graham Watson (ALDE) (7 February 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Belarus: Dzmitry Kanavalau and Uladzislau Kavalyou Belarus is currently the only country in Europe where the death penalty is regularly enforced. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus sentenced Dzmitry Kanavalau and Uladzislau Kavalyou to death for terrorist attacks between 2005 and 2011, although it would appear that the court disregarded important evidence regarding the accused. Is the High Representative aware of these two men’s arrest and conviction? What steps are being taken to appeal for clemency from President Lukashenka?
