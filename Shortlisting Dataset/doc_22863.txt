step forward for the strategic partnership; applauds the resolute efforts made towards this end by the Peruvian and Slovene Co-Presidency of the summit, the Slovene Presidency of the European Union, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union; Principles and priorities of the Biregional Strategic Partnership 2. Reaffirms its commitment to the biregional approach and to prioritising the Biregional Strategic Partnership as the best means of safeguarding the principles, values and interests shared by the partners on both sides of the Atlantic; 3. Reiterates the continued validity of the declaration on the values and positions shared by both regions that was issued at the Madrid Summit (2002) and the joint commitment to multilateralism, regional integration and social cohesion reaffirmed at the Guadalajara (2004) and Vienna (2006) summits; 4. Proposes an overall strategic vision for the partnership, which would not be confined to isolated proposals or actions and would have the ultimate goal of establishing a Euro-Latin American global interregional partnership area around the year 2012, to include a fully-fledged strategic partnership in the political, economic, social and cultural fields and the joint pursuit of sustainable development; 5.

Endorses the proposed agenda for the Lima summit and its focus on two main subject areas, the first being poverty, inequality and exclusion and the second, sustainable development and the related issues of environment, climate change and energy; 8. Points out that the swift setting up, following the Vienna summit, of the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly (EuroLat) as the strategic partnership's parliamentary institution has considerably enhanced the partnership's democratic legitimacy and consolidated its institutional system, which
