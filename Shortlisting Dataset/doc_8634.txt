part of the Member States, an attitude which is pushing the ECB into taking on an overtly political role in response to the current debt crisis; 18. Notes that monetary policy must take a share of the responsibility for the creation of asset bubbles, given the unsustainable credit growth during the years leading up to the crisis; 19. Takes note of the proposals on crisis management made by the ECB both in terms of economic governance and the bank resolution mechanism; 20 Deplores the lack of an adequate EU economic policy framework for crisis management and the hesitant management of the crisis by the Commission and the Member States, particularly those in which reforms are needed, and urges the Council and the Commission rapidly to put forward the comprehensive and far-reaching measures required to safeguard the stability of the euro; 21. Is alarmed at the continuous strains on the euro area sovereign bond markets, as reflected in widening spreads over the last two years; points out that the flight to safety provoked by the waves of panic during the current financial crisis have had massive distorting effects and have created costly negative externalities; commends the efforts made by the ECB by means of its Securities Markets Programme to reduce spreads in vulnerable Member States; 22. Takes note of the restructuring of Greek debt by means of a coordinated, voluntary EU exchange offer; considers that the Greek debt burden reduction agreed at the 21 July 2011 summit has done nothing to restore public debt sustainability; 23. Notes that, while deleveraging is continuing in parts of the private sector and most Member States, excessive debt levels are still very widespread in the public sector, not least as a result of measures to absorb the outcome of the financial crisis; 24. Recalls that prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis the public-debt-to-GDP ratio of the euro area had fallen from 72% in 1999 and to 67% in 2007 and that, in contrast, debt levels of households and firms and the level of leverage in the financial sector increased significantly over the same period; points out, in particular, that household debt in the euro area increased from 52% to 70% of GDP during the same period and that financial institutions increased their level of debt from less than 200% of GDP to more than 250%; acknowledges that some Member States, such as Greece and Italy, were significant exceptions to these general trends; 25. Notes the rapid increase in the leverage ratio of the ECB, as measured by its capital and reserves in relation to its assets, even though the leverage ratio cannot be applied to central banks in the same way as it can to commercial banks; notes, however, that by mid-August 2011 the ECB's balance sheet had already shrunk by around 10% from its peak, although it has been increasing rapidly since then; notes that, while there has been also a substantial expansion in the balance sheets of other central banks, the ECB's leverage ratio is higher than that of other comparable central banks,
