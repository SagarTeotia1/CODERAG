WRITTEN QUESTION P-4528/06 by Iratxe García Pérez (PSE) to the Commission (17 October 2006) Subject: Building development in a pine forest which is a black stork refuge The building development called ‘Ciudad del Golf de Las Navas del Marqués’ (in the town of Las Navas del Marqués in the region of Ávila) required land within the Pinares Bajo Alberche special bird protection area to be reclassified as building land, as approved at the appropriate stage by the Castilla and León Autonomous Government's Ministry of the Environment. The construction firm started felling trees on 6 October, ignoring the ruling handed down by the Castilla and León High Court which had ordered the work to be suspended. Is the Commission aware of the situation? What measures does it deem appropriate in order to insure that Habitat's Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 . and the Woodland Bird's Protection Directive 79/409/EEC OJ L 103, 25.4.1974, p. 1 . are complied with?
