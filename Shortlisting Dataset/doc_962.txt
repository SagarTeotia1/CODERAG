there was power under the sound and prudent management umbrella to prevent such a declaration. With intervention as a last resort ... passing a bonus was "probably necessary for the prudent management of the Society”. In any case, FSA did not insist ." (Ch.17-110) "(EL) Headdon's self-indulgent interpretation of “a few % points” was disregarded by all but the more junior of the actuaries involved. GAD considered that no effective action could be taken." (Ch.17-111) "Due to the explosion of the annuity guarantee issue there had been no scrutiny report on the 1997 returns and therefore the regulators had not had the benefit of such a report since the 1996 scrutiny report in December 1997. GAD completed the initial scrutiny of the 1998 return on 9 April 1999 ... The FSA still lacked the further information about solvency projections and contingency plans requested ... on 1 February 1999. They chased the Society for these (and a copy of the finalised reinsurance treaty) on 15 April. The full scrutiny report, dated 20 May 1999, ran to some 23 pages and headlined the Society's priority rating as 2. It combined statements on both 1997 and 1998" (Ch.17-128,133 and139) " The relative complacency of the1998 report reflects the extent of the reliance being placed upon the reinsurance treaty by both GAD and FSA, and the concentration of attention on regulatory solvency rather than any realistic view of the Society's long-term position ." (Ch.17-146) "In August 1999, while the outcome of the (High Court) case was awaited, FSA prepared an “initial risk assessment” of the Society as part of a pilot project for a new risk-based approached to supervision. In it the Society was classified as a “high financial risk” because of the level of guaranteed benefits, low free asset position and the difficulty of raising external finance. Under the heading 'Management' the Society's cultural attitude was described as having: “A tendency toward arrogant superiority regarding the efficiency of their operations and the high priority given to the interests of policyholders. This can blind them to the financial risks that can arise as a result of guaranteeing high benefit levels. However they are open with the regulator and there are no particular concerns about the level of cooperation that has been shown in the past.” The assessment acknowledged that there was little evidence available about corporate governance." (Ch.18-22) "On 13 September 1999 the FSA senior line supervisor suggested to Headdon that there should be a general company visit in early December (the last such visit had been in November 1996)." (Ch.18-25) c) Negligence by Regulators " No scrutiny report has been found in either DTI or GAD files for 1987 or 1988, and the inquiry has been told by the then principal actuary ... that it is possible that no detailed scrutiny report was prepared because GAD were involved in a recruitment drive ... to fill various vacancies ." But "these years were crucial as 1987 was a poor year for the Society in the markets... and the Society's available assets were insufficient to cover total
