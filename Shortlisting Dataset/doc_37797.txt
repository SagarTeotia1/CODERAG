Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (30 October 2008) The Commission welcomes the recent release by the Chief Advisor of election dates for the parliamentary (18 December 2008) and sub-District (upazila) (24 and 28 December 2008) elections. Whilst the political situation is still evolving, recent developments would suggest that participation by major political parties in the parliamentary elections is becoming more likely. The Commission has consistently demonstrated its commitment to a democratic and stable Bangladesh, notably through the decision to send — and subsequently suspend — an EU Election Observation Mission for the cancelled elections of January 2007, and through its strong support for efforts by the Bangladeshi authorities to prepare the ground for the handover of power to a democratically elected government, including the preparation of a voter list with photographs, for which the Commission was the first foreign contributor (EUR 15 million under the 2007Annual Action Programme). With this support, the Bangladesh Election Commission has completed the electronic registration of over 80 million voters with photographs and fingerprints in a span of just a year and ID Cards have been delivered to the people, very often for the first time in their life. This tremendous task of establishing a credible voters list is for us one of the prerequisites for having free and fair elections. The Commission will take a decision in principle in the near future on the redeployment of the EU’s Election Observation Mission during the December elections. A key consideration in that decision will be the restoration of fundamental rights in good time for the elections. The EU continues to encourage all parties to engage constructively on reform issues and is concerned to ensure that an incoming government protects and sustains the reforms, such as the Human Rights Commission and the reinvigorated Anti-Corruption Commission, which have been achieved by the interim government.
