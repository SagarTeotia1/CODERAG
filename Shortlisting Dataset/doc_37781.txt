Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (20 December 2007) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU reaffirms rights as resulting in particular from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to the Member States, the Treaty on European Union, the Community Treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Social Charter and the case-law of the European Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights. The Charter contains rights that are not expressly enshrined in the ECHR and are based on various other sources, such as the right to protection of personal data, rights linked to bioethics and a number of social and citizens' rights. In comparison with the ECHR, the Charter also provides for extended protection as regards certain rights, such as the right to an effective remedy (which is required to be a judicial remedy, as opposed to a redress before an administrative body, and to be available for all individual rights and freedoms protected by Union law) or the right not to be tried or punished twice (which applies not only to jurisdictions within the same state but ‘within the Union’). Finally the Commission would like to clarify that the Charter will not be annexed to the new Treaty. A reference in Article 6 of the new Treaty will provide that the Charter will have the same legal value as the Treaties. Furthermore, following its proclamation by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 12 December 2007, the Charter will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities .
