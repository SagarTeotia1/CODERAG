WRITTEN QUESTION E-2169/05 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (21 June 2005) Subject: Renewables in Scotland In light of the report commissioned by the UK Department of Trade and Industry (A strategic framework for hydrogen energy in the UK, December 2004), if the UK Government decides to confirm that it will strictly limit investment in the development of hydrogen energy and fuel cells while raising investment for the nuclear industry, can the Commission explain whether this would represent an inconsistency with stated EU policy as well as lead to the creation of an environmental deficit?
