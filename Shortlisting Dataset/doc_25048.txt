9999/C Q999 E/043 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1257/04 by Marie Isler Béguin (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (15 April 2004) Subject: Principle of environmental interference A number of industrial or political initiatives affecting the natural environment outside the EU pose an ecological threat within the Community territory. As an example, in September 2003, Russia planned to sell 843 million hectares of forest land to private farmers, thereby clearing the way for the commercial exploitation of an area considered the lungs of Europe, second in size only to the Amazon basin, as well as the animal species and rare vegetation found therein. The EU has stepped up its fight against offences that have damaging effects on the environment, as well as its efforts to prevent them with the establishment of a criminal-law framework making the most serious of them criminal acts. Does the Commission not feel, given such legal advances, which will both codify the Community's accountability and bring about a process of deligitimisation of territorial sovereignty in cases of extensive or cross-border environmental crime, that it should recognise the existence of a principle of environmental interference on the external stage? Should the Commission not show its political ambition and value system on both the European and international stages by sanctioning this development in the law and establishing the principle of environmental interference in the European Constitution, which is still being negotiated?
