Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2005) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for his written question regarding the investigation into the murder of the journalist, José Couso. The Commission has always favoured investigations to clarify the circumstances surrounding dreadful situations such as the death of the Spanish journalist, Mr. Couso and his colleagues, or, more recently, the injury of the Italian journalist and the death of an Italian security agent. The issue of the steps to be taken to ensure that an investigation is carried out remains under the competence of the relevant Member States. The Commission will not hesitate to support any further effort in this direction if so requested by the relevant national authorities.
