WRITTEN QUESTION E-1525/06 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (7 April 2006) Subject: Community subsidies for dredging and de-contamination schemes in the Algarve At a meeting with organisations representing fishermen, environmentalists and people employed in catching bivalve molluscs shellfish in Olhão, in the Algarve, I heard complaints about the pollution of the Ria Formosa, the setting-up the harbour bar at Fuzeta and the harbour bar at Lavage (the old Olhão harbour bar), and the lack of proper sanitation and health and hygiene infrastructure and installations at Olhão harbour. The two harbour bars need to be dredged as a matter of urgency, in order to oxygenate the water and combat pollution, which is essential if the important Ria Formosa ecosystem, including its molluscs, is to be protected, with all that it represents in terms of fisheries, tourism and quality of life. What Community subsidies could be used for the schemes to dredge, decontaminate and help protect the Ria Formosa at the Fuzeta and Lavage harbour bars, and in Olhão harbour?
