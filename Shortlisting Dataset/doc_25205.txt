Question for written answer E-011289/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Brian Simpson (S&D) (1 December 2011) Subject: Fuel top-up in rented vehicles Is the Commission aware that it is common practice in some countries, for example Spain, to charge customers for a full tank of fuel when they hire a motor vehicle? Furthermore, when the vehicles are returned with fuel in the tank, no refund is given and the next customer is charged again for a full tank. This means that customers have in effect paid twice for the fuel remaining in the tank and the car hire company is pocketing the difference. Can the Commission indicate whether such practices are in fact illegal? If so, what action does it intend to take to put an end to this ‘rip-off’ of unsuspecting consumers, given that it also encourages them to use up fuel needlessly?
