Question for written answer E-6921/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (6 September 2010) Subject: Supply of lithium and EU international political and economic measures According to analysts and experts, the future global economic and geopolitical framework will depend not only on the energy race but also on the supply of the raw materials that are necessary for human and animal food, not to mention the production of consumer goods or those that are necessary for strategic industrial sectors such as the military and high-technology industries. Among the materials that are currently attracting the attention of financial operators and governments are a number of elements such as lithium, which is vital for the production of high-technology goods. Given the strategic importance of the element in question, does the Commission not agree that it would be in the EU's interest to facilitate the procurement of lithium for industry in the Member States? What action does it think it would be possible to take in terms of international political and economic relations in order to achieve that objective?
