Question for written answer E-001720/2012 to the Council Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (13 February 2012) Subject: Risk-sharing instruments The proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, which modifies certain provisions on risk-sharing instruments that may be used by Member States experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, states on page 2 of the introduction that: ‘In addition, infrastructure projects relevant in the context of the economic recovery of the Member States concerned can also be supported if considered appropriate’. In addition, on 19 October 2011 the Commission presented the map of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN‑T) for the railway sector. As the Commission states on its website: ‘Establishing an efficient trans-European transport network (TEN‑T) has constituted a key element in the relaunched Lisbon strategy for competitiveness and employment in Europe and will play an equally central role in the attainment of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. If Europe is to fulfil its economic and social potential, it is essential to build the missing links and remove the bottlenecks in our transport infrastructure, as well as to ensure the future sustainability of our transport networks by taking into account energy efficiency needs and climate change challenges’. The rapid construction of TEN‑T is therefore crucial in order to achieve sustainable growth in Europe. In light of the above: What does the Council think of the possibility of using these risk-sharing instruments to finance TEN‑T infrastructures in Member States facing grave difficulties with respect to their financial stability?
