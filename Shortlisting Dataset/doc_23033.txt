Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (24 November 2011) The European Union, assisted by the EU Delegations in Delhi and Islamabad, follows developments in the disputed territory of Kashmir closely. It is a longstanding position of the EU to support the reconciliation process in the region and to call for the Kashmiri people themselves to be involved as much as possible in this process. Fact-finding missions to Jammu and Kashmir have been organised by the EU Member State embassies and the EU Delegation in Delhi; humanitarian assistance has been provided to help vulnerable groups affected by the conflict; and the role of the Indian security forces in the region is regularly raised with the Indian authorities in the framework of the annual local EU‑India Human Rights Dialogue. The European Union will continue to monitor the situation in the region and where possible raise related issues in the appropriate forums.
