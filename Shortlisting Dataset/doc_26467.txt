Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2011) The Commission is well aware of the questions raised by Belgian travel agencies about the position of Lufthansa on routes into Brussels, in particular following the takeover of SN Brussels Airlines. If there are serious concerns about a breach of competition law by Lufthansa, travel agents (or an association thereof) have the possibility to lodge a complaint either with the Commission or with the national competition authority, which is entitled to apply EU competition law fully. The Commission's clearance of the acquisition of SN Brussels Airlines by Lufthansa was conditional upon the implementation of a set of remedies, offered by Lufthansa to alleviate the Commission's competition concerns. In particular, Lufthansa made the commitment to offer slots that would allow new entrants to operate flights on each of the four routes where the Commission had identified concerns, i.e. Brussels-Frankfurt, Brussels-Munich, Brussels-Hamburg and Brussels-Zürich. A trustee has been appointed to monitor whether Lufthansa is fulfilling its commitments. At the end of every summer and winter season the trustee provides a written report to the Commission on the parties' compliance with the commitments made. To the Commission's knowledge, no prospective new entrants have so far applied to receive the slots made available by the parties at the airports concerned. Based on the periodic reports provided by the trustee, the Commission does not perceive the need to take additional measures at this stage.
