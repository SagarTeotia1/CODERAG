Question for written answer E-7416/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (20 September 2010) Subject: Tension in northern Epirus In the evening of 12 August 2010, in Himara in northern Epirus, a group of seven Albanians murdered 36 year-old Aristotelis Goumas, a Greek from northern Epirus, because he was speaking Greek in the place where he was born! They chased him through the streets of Himara and deliberately ran him down in their car, which resulted in his horrific and immediate death. The Albanian media made a concerted effort to portray the murder of Aristotelis Goumas to international public opinion as a road accident, whereas in fact it was motivated by ethnic hatred. The Albanian media's anti-Greek fury continued with their offensive coverage of the funeral of the murdered Greek from northern Epirus the following day. Over a period of just 20 years, Albanians who had no connection with northern Epirus have become owners of tens of thousands of hectares of land by means of falsified title deeds and with the aid of the Albanian State and parastatal organisations. Bearing in mind that Albania is an applicant country for accession to the European Union, what are the Commission's views on the above incident and what will it do to protect the rights of our Greek fellow citizens in the region concerned?
