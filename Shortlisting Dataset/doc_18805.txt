Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (12 November 2010) The Commission is not providing financial support to a lunar mission. The bulk of the costs for the organisation of this conference (e.g. venue, dinner) are incurred by the Belgian Presidency. The Commission will only cover costs related to interpretation and information and communication activities. The participants' position on space exploration is reflected in the conclusions of the conference that will be available on the web.In the preparation of the next Space Council resolutions, the various aspects of space exploration are being considered.
