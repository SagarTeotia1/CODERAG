Question for written answer P-005674/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Josefa Andrés Barea (S&D) (8 June 2011) Subject: Fisheries partnership agreement with Guinea-Bissau The implementing protocol for the fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau will expire on 15 June 2011. As there are only fifteen days left till the expiry date, and in view of the risk of cessation of activity of the entire European fleet in the waters concerned, can the Commission state what measures it will take to ensure that this protocol is renewed before its lapse date? Should it be necessary, has the Commission considered the possibility of organising an emergency mechanism which would make it possible to continue using licences after 16 June?
