Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (2 December 2005) 1. The Commission’s legislative and work programme for 2005 foresees the adoption of the seven Thematic Strategies in 2005. The Commission adopted the thematic strategy on air pollution on 21 September 2005 COM(2005)446 final. . The marine strategy was adopted on the 24 October 2005. Four of the remaining thematic strategies will be adopted in the last months of 2005. The pesticides strategy will come early in 2006 given that two substantial measures to be referred to in the strategy — the revision of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market OJ L 230, 19.8.1991. and the Eurostat proposal on pesticide statistics will not be ready in 2005. For coherence reasons, the Commission feels that it is more opportune to wait until these proposals are ready before presenting the pesticides strategy, in order for the Commission to adopt a comprehensive package of measures addressing pesticides. 2. The thematic strategies are important initiatives that include actions to be taken in other sectors. It is thus essential that the Commission discuss the strategies in a thorough manner. With this in mind, the President of the Commission called for an orientation debate which was held at College level on 20 July 2005. This forward-looking debate brought general support for the thematic strategies approach and for maintaining ambitious environmental objectives alongside the EU’s growth and employment goals.
