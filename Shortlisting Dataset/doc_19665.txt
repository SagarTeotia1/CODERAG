Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (28 March 2008) The historic model of the single payment scheme (SPS) allowed farmers to be market oriented while retaining their past support levels, whereas the regional model redistributed support to farmers in a way that support per hectare is similar within regions. The approach of the historic model greatly facilitated the move to decoupling in some Member States (MS) in 2003, when some sectors were reformed. However, since then more sectors have entered into the system (Mediterranean products in 2004, sugar in 2005, fruit and vegetables in 2006) extending the SPS and changing the distribution of support. As this process is being completed, concerns about the ‘fair’ treatment of farmers are raised since the historic model can be regarded as being less equitable than the regional one. This is due to the fact that it gives aid to individual farmers based on their past support levels, which reflect the previous structure of production and of agricultural support. As the historic reference period for payments becomes more distant, these individual differences will continue to become harder to justify. For this reason the Health Check Communication COM(2007)722 final. discusses the possibility to allow MS, on an optional basis, to adjust their SPS model towards flatter rates based on the experience gained so far from SPS implementation across the EU. While the move towards flatter rates would lead to a certain redistribution of support among farmers, MS would have the possibility to mitigate redistributional and income consequences by setting payment rates at the appropriate regional scale and/or allowing for a gradual move towards more equal levels of support. It should also be kept in mind that, since the move towards flatter rates concerns decoupled SPS payments, it would not have any effect on the viability of agricultural production.
