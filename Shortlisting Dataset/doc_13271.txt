Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (29 November 2005) Tracking products made of wood harvested in one country and processed in another is more complex than tracking primary and rough-processed products manufactured in the country where the raw material was harvested. According to the non-preferential rules of origin, as set out in the European Community customs code Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community customs code, OJ L 302, 19.10.1992 as last amended. , and which also apply to timber imports into the Community, goods are deemed to originate in the country where they underwent their last, substantial, economically justified processing. This means that timber products manufactured in third countries with imported wood can legitimately be considered to originate in that country. This highlights how any measures aimed at eliminating trade in illegal timber products would be more efficient if extended to include collaboration with other importers in a multilateral framework. Progress towards multilateral arrangements for forests has been very slow, hence the bilateral approach taken by the Commission. Nevertheless, efforts are ongoing to engage other major importing and re-exporting countries in the fight against illegal logging. Promising initiatives are being taken through the Group of Eight most industrialised countries (G8), which issued a ministerial statement on illegal logging in March 2005, through regional political processes for forest law enforcement and governance, particularly in East and North Asia, and in political dialogue with the countries concerned. In this regard, it is particularly encouraging that the September 2005 EU‑China Summit declaration included a commitment to cooperate to combat illegal logging.
