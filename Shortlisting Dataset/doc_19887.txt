ITRE Energy Efficiency Directive The proposed Directive aims at establishing a framework for promoting energy efficiency to ensure that the Union meets its target of 20% primary energy savings by 2020. The proposal includes an obligation for Member States to lay down national energy efficiency targets for 2020 and a set of measures for end-users on the one hand and the energy supply sector on the other. It contains among others the following elements: requirements for public sector as regards renovation of existing buildings; application of energy efficiency standards for purchasing buildings, services and products; obligation to establish national energy efficiency obligation schemes (regular mandatory energy audits for large companies, requirements for metering and billing of energy); requirements for Member States to adopt national heating and cooling plans (including coherence with spatial planning); obligation to set up an inventory of energy efficiency data for installations combusting or refining fuels.
