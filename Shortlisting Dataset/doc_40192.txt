Question for written answer E-7624/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (28 September 2010) Subject: Role of the EU concerning relations between China and the USA In my opinion, it is necessary to strengthen the EU in economic, political and military terms in order to secure it a leading role on the international stage. A great deal of column space is currently being devoted to commentary and analysis of what is judged to be a looming economic, political and military crisis of major proportions between China and the USA. In my view, the USA is likely to push for a revaluation of the Chinese currency in the immediate future. The Chinese response, published in the international press, intimates that this could result in a trade war between the two. The situation is being compounded by major political differences of opinion between Beijing and Washington (on the questions of Taiwan, Tibet, the Spratly Islands, etc.). In view of this: Have plans been drawn up for the EU to act as an intermediary in the event of any major deterioration in relations between the USA and China, with a view to finding appropriate and mutually acceptable solutions to the above problem?
