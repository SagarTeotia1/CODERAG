Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (3 February 2012) There are no available comprehensive data on the costs of corruption for each EU Member State or for the EU as a whole. The figures mentioned by the Honourable Member are rough estimates. The annual cost of corruption worldwide has been estimated at more than 5 % of global GDP (USD 2.6 trillion). For the purpose of the impact assessment accompanying the Commission's anti-corruption package, it was estimated that the costs of corruption in the EU amount to 1 % of EU GDP (about EUR 120 billion euro per year). More details on the methodology used for these estimates can be found in the impact assessment http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/ia_carried_out/docs/ia_2011/sec_2011_0660_en.pdf accompanying the Commission Decision establishing the EU Anti-Corruption Report. As for the criteria to be used in the EU Anti-Corruption Report, as mentioned in the communication on Fighting Corruption in the EU http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/malmstrom/archive/com308_corruption_en.pdf , the report will draw on the minimum standards against corruption established by existing international instruments and will focus on implementation aspects. It will also ensure that the gaps in existing international and European monitoring tools are addressed. The effectiveness of implementation will be assessed against quantitative and qualitative indicators. The Commission will consider acknowledged indicators used by existing monitoring mechanisms, as well as new indicators to be developed in the preparation of the report. The Commission will be supported in its work by a group of experts set up in September 2011 Commission Decision 2011/C 286/03. .
