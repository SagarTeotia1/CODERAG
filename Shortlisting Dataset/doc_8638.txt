Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (22 September 2008) 1 ‑ 2. The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑3930/08 by Mr Skinner http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB . Furthermore, the Commission also encourages dialogue between the stakeholders involved, mainly Eurostar, Ashford Borough Council and Kent County Council. To this end, in order to allow all parties to state their positions and explore possibilities to bring these positions together, the Commission hosted a meeting in July 2007. If still needed, a follow-up meeting will take place at the end of 2008.
