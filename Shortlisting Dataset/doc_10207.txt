WRITTEN QUESTION E-3316/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (23 September 2005) Subject: EU funding of non-governmental organisations According to reports in the Greek press, 38 Greek non-governmental organisations (NGOs) received EUR 18459151 .88 in subsidies from the Commission during the period 2000‑2004. These NGOs include, for example, the Idryma Egnatia Ipirou, which appears to have received the highest amount (EUR 2256976 .21), i.e. that organisation alone received more than 10 % of the total funding given to Greek NGOs for the purpose of ‘forging links between local communities — the Neertion network for Latin America’. Indeed, the Greek press reports that the Commission appeared ‘reluctant’ to make this information about Greek NGOs public (article in the newspaper To Paron of 4 September 2005). What exactly does the EU-funded programme of the Idryma Egnatia Ipirou contain? In which years precisely did this particular NGO receive funding and to what amount? Does the Commission have any data concerning the precise economic benefit that Greece and the other Member States of the EU have derived from the implementation of this particular initiative? Were, for example, jobs created in Greece and other Member States through the subsidisation of this NGO and the other Greek NGOs? What appropriations exactly have the other Greek NGOs received since 1990 to the present time?
