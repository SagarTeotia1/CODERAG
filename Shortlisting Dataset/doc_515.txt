WRITTEN QUESTION E-3239/10 by Geoffrey Van Orden (ECR) to the Commission (7 May 2010) Subject: EU funding for Zimbabwean Constitutional drafting process Can the Commission explain what measures it will take to ensure that the EUR 6 million its Harare delegation has recently allocated (20 April 2010) towards covering the costs of a public outreach campaign during the drafting of the new Zimbabwean Constitution is not misappropriated by the governing ZANU-PF party, a party with a long-established and well-documented history of misappropriating donor money? Is the Commission aware that one of the Constitutional Committee's members — Florence Buka — is a member of President Mugabe’s inner circle and is one of the 203 individuals proscribed from travelling to the EU under EU restrictive measures (2010/92/CFSP) OJ L 46, 16.2.2010, p. 6 , referring to Council Common Position 2004/161/CFSP, OJ L 50, 20.2.2004, p. 66. ? Can the Commission provide a detailed breakdown of all the programmes it is currently funding in Zimbabwe, as well as providing details of the measures it has in place to ensure that funds are not misappropriated by the Mugabe clique? Furthermore, in the spirit of the promotion of democracy and free speech, will the Commission consider financing the independent Zimbabwean Media Commission, which is currently unable to do its job due to a lack of finance, and which civic groups (Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions; Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum: Zimbabwe Exiles Forum) have said could play an important role in the re-opening of independent newspapers?
