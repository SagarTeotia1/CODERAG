Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (20 August 2010) The Russian Federation and the European Union are interdependent partners in the field of energy. The Russian Federation is the third biggest world trade partner of the EU. Energy represents 65 % of total EU imports from Russia. Russia is the biggest external supplier of oil, gas, uranium and coal to the EU. In 2007, 44 % of the EU’s total gas imports, 33 % of the EU’s total crude oil imports, and 26 % of the EU's coal imports came from Russia. In total, around 24 % of total gas consumed in the EU originates from Russia. The EU is by far the largest trade partner of the Russian Federation: 45 % of Russia's imports originate from the EU, and 55 % of its exports go to the EU, including 88 % of Russia's total oil exports, 70 % of its gas exports and 50 % of its coal exports. The Commission therefore considers that, based on this interdependence and their long-standing relations, Russia and the EU should continue to strengthen their close cooperation in the field of energy. At the same time, the Commission is closely following relations between the Russian Federation and transit countries and will continue to pursue policies towards consolidation of the internal EU energy market and promotion of the physical interconnections within the EU as well as the diversification of supplies and routes to ensure security of supply of the EU. Likewise, the EU is working on enhancing the overall bilateral legal framework with Russia in the context of the negotiations on a new EU‑Russia Agreement, which will also contain provisions on energy, and continues to encourage Russian engagement in the Energy Charter process.
