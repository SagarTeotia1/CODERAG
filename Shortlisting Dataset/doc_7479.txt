Question for written answer E-005942/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Paul Nuttall (EFD) (20 June 2011) Subject: Gaza's Rafah crossing and fake ID issued by Egyptian institutions It has been reported in the press that the EU is one of the parties which has the right to monitor the Rafah crossing in Gaza to ensure that elicit materials, such as weapons, do not make it through to Hamas. It has been reported in the press that Palestinians will be permitted to move back and forth between Egypt and Gaza provided they have documentary proof that they are studying at a university in Egypt (see the article ‘L’Egypte rouvre le terminal de Rafah’ in Le Soir of 28.5.2011 (Belgium)). However, there is a possibility that educational institutions, and ‘front’ educational institutions, will simply provide false ID papers in this regards to Gazans attempting to move back and forth for the purposes of terrorism. What action will the EU take with the Egyptian authorities to ensure that this system is not abused?
