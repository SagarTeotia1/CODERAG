Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2010) 1. An overview of the implementation rates of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) in 2008 and 2009 is provided in the following table: Execution of commitment and payment appropriations — 2008‑09 Appropriations (Budget voted or C1 credits + Modifications) (EUR) Execution (Budget voted or C1 credits + Modifications) (EUR) Execution (%) 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 Commitments 400 629 369 493 826 400 399 654 506 493 526 431 99.76 % 99.94 % Payments 257 007 227 202 491 351 236 056 719 165 273 895 91.85 % 81.62 % 2. In 2009 and 2010, no commitment appropriations have been transferred from the CIP to the EGF. In the 2009 budget year, no payment appropriations were transfered from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (EIP) or other specific programmes under the CIP to the EGF budget line. In 2010, the Commission proposed several transfers in payment appropriations to the EGF. These transfers only concern the financial instruments under the specific programme EIP in Title 01. Taking into account transfers already proposed but not yet approved by the Budget Authority, at the end of the year the following amounts would have been transfered: — a total of EUR 39 734 224 from budget line 01 04 04 (financial instruments under the CIP/EIP); — a total of EUR 21 381 228 from budget line 01 04 05 (previous Programme for Enterprises: improvement of the financial environment for small and medium-sized enterprises). 3. Regarding commitment appropriations, the implementation rate for the whole CIP is very good (99.76 % in 2008 and 99.94 % in 2009). The aforementioned transfer of funds from budget items 01 04 04 and 01 04 05 concerns payment appropriations. Since the payments may be due over the whole lifetime of the contracts signed, there is an inherent time lag between commitments and payments. Requested payment appropriations for a given year are calculated one year ahead on the base of estimations, which are regularly reviewed and maybe adjusted if necessary. Therefore, the transfer of payment appropriations does not prevent the Commission from either using commitments or its ability to sign new contracts for guarantees and investments. Until now, all foreseen appropriations on budget line 01 04 04 have been committed according to schedule. 4. For 2010, the Commission expects a similarly good execution performance for the commitment appropriations of the CIP as in previous years. As regards payment appropriations, the Commission considers that with growing experience in the implementation of the framework programme, realistic estimates of the need for payment appropriations are available and therefore that the execution of payment appropriations will improve further.
