the opinion that flexibility and security requirements are not contradictory and are mutually reinforcing; 44. Stresses that flexicurity can only be achieved by effective and modern labour law that reflects the changing realities of work; Notes that collective bargaining and strong social partners are an important part of the flexicurity approach; believes however that there are various models of flexicurity. Notes that a common approach should be based on combining firms and workers ability to adapt with a sufficient level of social protection, social security and unemployment benefits, active labour market policies and training/ lifelong learning opportunities; Considers that broad welfare provisions and universal access to services such as childcare and other dependents contribute positively to these aims; 45.

Calls on the Commission to launch an information campaign directed at employers and workers aimed at drawing attention to the applicable EU minimum rules and regulations and adverse effects clandestine work can have on national social security systems, public finances, fair competition, economic performance and on workers themselves; 51. Calls for special attention to be directed to young workers who are most engaged in temporary work to ensure that their lack of experience on the job does not lead to work-related accidents; encourages Member States to exchange good practice in this regard and calls on temporary employment agencies to raise awareness among employers and the young workers themselves; 52.
