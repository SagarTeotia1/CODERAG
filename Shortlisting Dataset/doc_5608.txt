Becker (PPE) (10 November 2011) Subject: Mainstreaming ageing issues in development and humanitarian programmes 2012 will be the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, which marks the 10th anniversary of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing adopted by the United Nations in 2002. The EY2012 aims to improve opportunities for active ageing and independent living, acting in areas as diverse as employment, healthcare, social services, adult learning and housing. It also aims to encourage all policymakers and stakeholders to set themselves goals and take concrete action with a view to meeting these. When developing the activities of the EY2012, how will the Commission ensure that ageing issues are mainstreamed in all the EU policy areas (internal and external), and especially in development and humanitarian programmes?
