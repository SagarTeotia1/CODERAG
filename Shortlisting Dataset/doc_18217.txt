ORAL QUESTION H-0293/03/rev.1 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Alexandros Alavanos to the Commission Subject: Implementation of Council Directive 1999/70/EC by Greece Presidential Decree 81/2003 transposes Directive 1999/70/EC into Greek law nine months after the transposition deadline. Article 5 of the presidential decree exempts those workers paid ‘from appropriations from the State budget or the budget of a legal person under public law earmarked by the budget for work lasting for a fixed term’ and many other workers in the private sector. These exemptions, particularly that of the public sector, have met with opposition from the social partners (Opinion 79/2002 from the Economic and Social Committee) on the grounds that they clearly run counter to the directive’s sphere of application and certainly do not prevent the abuse of fixed term contracts. In view of this, does the Commission consider that the above ‘paragraph’ of Article 5 of the presidential decree complies with the letter and spirit of Directive 1999/70? Does it intend to initiate infringement proceedings against Greece for incorrect implementation of Directive 1999/70/EC, under Article 126 of the Treaty? OJ L 175, 10.7.1999, p. 43.
