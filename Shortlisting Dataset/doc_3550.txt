is different for each Member State, I believe that, on the basis of our own experiences, Finland has something to offer the Union. The third priority during Finland’s Presidency will be external relations . There is a link to the economy here, since the Union’s economic strength forms the basis for its external action. From being an attractive and interesting trading partner follows influence. The fourth priority covers promoting citizens’ access to justice and strengthening the international justice system . Assessing The Hague programme will allow us to carry out a thorough political analysis of Justice and Home Affairs. The fifth and last priority which I would particularly like to mention here is transparent and efficient procedures . Transparency will be increased in accordance with the European Council’s decision last week. In principle all Council deliberations under the co-decision procedure will be public. This decision is welcomed by Finland, which has consistently highlighted the need for transparency. I believe that transparency will also help us win citizens’ confidence and enhance EU’s legitimacy. Here we will apply common sense: transparency in the legislative process does not prevent ministers from holding confidential discussions when necessary ."

The committee's interim report - approved by 25 votes to 14 with 7 abstentions - sends out a clear message. It believes the CIA has organised extraordinary renditions and it criticises European states for inactivity or complicity in the face of this phenomenon. According to the committee, the CIA has been " directly responsible " on several occasions for the extraordinary rendition, " illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of terrorist suspects on the territory of Member States, accession and candidate countries " - all of which constitute violations of fundamental rights under international law. MEPs say the CIA - using aircraft hired by front companies - has made use of such practices for the illegal transfer of terrorist suspects to countries which frequently use torture during interrogations.
