parties before adopting new accounting standards. As for the funding of the IASB, MEPs in the committee want to ensure that all user groups are adequately involved, that there is no conflict of interest between financiers and users and that access to the standards themselves is made easier. They call on the Commission to examine how it might be able to contribute to funding the IASCF/IASB. It also suggests a funding method involving all publicly traded companies in the EU. MEPs are keen to ensure the IFRS themselves are interpreted in a consistent manner. They ask the Commission to develop an EU structure as an international partner for third country bodies on this issue and to guarantee uniform interpretation and application. IFRS for SMEs – too complicated for most The report says that the IASB’s proposed version of the IFRS for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is far to complicated for most of them. While it might be a transitional option for larger SMEs hoping to expand, it should not be used for enforced harmonisation of SME accounting standards. The committee says the Commission should arrange a proper consultation procedure for an EU accounting framework for SMEs. Among other points, the report emphasises that convergence with third-country standards (such as US GAAP) must be based on a prior assessment of the impact and merits of changes for EU companies and users of financial statements. It also calls for the “fair value” principle to be limited in scope, noting that it can be costly and lead to unrealistic valuations in some circumstances. Message received? Since the adoption of the report in committee, Gerrit Zalm, Chair of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, has appeared before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. He announced a number of changes to the governance mechanisms of the IASCF and IASB, notably the proposed creation of a Monitoring Group (made up, he suggested of the responsible European Commissioner, the heads of the IMF, World Bank, Japan Financial Services Agency, US Securities and Exchange Commission and the chairs of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions’ Emerging Markets Committee and the IOSCO Technical Committee). This body would approve the appointment of Trustees to the IASCF, ending the self-appointment system, and more generally monitor the work of the IASCF and IASB . Mr Zalm also proposed a new size and structure for the IASB itself, with a system to ensure geographical balance between its members. He hoped these arrangements could be in place by January 2009.
