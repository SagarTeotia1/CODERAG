WRITTEN QUESTION E-5009/07 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (12 October 2007) Subject: Support for farmers with livestock affected by bluetongue Outbreaks of bluetongue (or catarrhal fever) are now occurring on sheep farms in a number of areas of the Alentejo region in Portugal, namely Serpa, Barrancos, Moura and Reguengos de Monsaraz. This is creating problems for farmers, since sheep farming is one of their main activities. Can the Commission state what measures are being taken to assist farmers affected by this problem, with a view to guaranteeing their income levels and contributing to the rapid elimination of this livestock disease?
