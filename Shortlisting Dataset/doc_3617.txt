Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (20 May 2011) Under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, children have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being and the child’s best interests must be a primary consideration in all action relating to children. Furthermore, the Charter provides that every child has the right to maintain, on a regular basis, a personal relationship and direct contact with both his or her parents. The Commission therefore takes cases of alleged sexual abuse of children and cross-border parental child abduction very seriously. The Commission carefully monitors the correct application of Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000, OJ L 338, 23.12.2003. regulating jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matters of parental responsibility and cross-border parental child abduction. The regulation entered into application on 1 March 2005. Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union, OJ L 327, 5.12.2008. covers transfers of prisoners between Member States. It enhances the procedural rights of individuals and fosters application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions taken in the absence of the person concerned at the trial. It covers only sentenced persons. On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Members, it is not possible for the Commission to verify if there has been an infringement of EC law in the case in question. If the case file were forwarded to the Commission, it would be able to analyse the case and decide on the appropriate course of action.
