Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (19 September 2007) The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that it is currently monitoring the impacts of Commission Recommendation 2005/737/EC Commission Recommendation of 18 May 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 276, 21.10.2005. . On 17 January 2007 the Commission invited all interested stakeholders, including Parliament, to submit views and comments on their initial experience with the recommendation. The ‘Call for Comments’ questionnaire, which is accessible on the Commission webpage http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/management/management_en.htm#monitoring , represents a basis for monitoring. The main issues that are being monitored are the nature of the instrument, the EU‑wide licensing, the scope of the recommendation and governance and transparency. All stakeholders were invited to comment on the abovementioned issues by 1 July 2007. By August 2007 the Commission received around 80 replies from various interested parties. The process of reviewing the submissions is currently ongoing. After thorough examination the Commission will assess the need for further policy steps with respect to how collecting societies operate online but also in the traditional offline environment.
