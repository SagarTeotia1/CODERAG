Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (4 June 2009) This dispute is hampering the relations between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece and a solution would be mutually beneficial. The dispute should not become permanent. The Commission has repeated its calls on the parties to engage constructively. Actions which could negatively affect good neighbourly relations should be avoided. Renewed efforts with a positive approach are needed to find a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution under the auspices of the United Nations, within the framework of UNSCR 817/93 and 845/93. Talks are currently being held under the auspices of the United Nations. The Commission hopes that these talks will be fruitful.
