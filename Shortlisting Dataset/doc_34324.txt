Supplementary answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (4 January 2005) 1. The Commission received a reply from Germany on 10 November 2004 to its request of information sent on 22 September 2004. 2. As regards the exchange of land and the alleged payment of € 1.9 million by the Land of Lower Saxony, Germany informed the Commission that an exchange of land between Georgsmarienhütte (GMH) and the city of Osnabrück took place in 2003. Germany also informed the Commission that no payment was made in relation to this exchange of land. The value of the exchanged pieces of land was established on the basis of an evaluation carried out by an independent expert. As regards the sale of the ‘Hüttenbahn’ to the Osnabrück rural district company, Germany informed the Commission that the price was also established on the basis of the report of an independent expert who evaluated the value of the ‘Hüttenbahn’ by using the method of the capitalised earnings. This report was submitted to the Commission. The background of the sale was the plan of the region of Osnabrück to reactivate a railway for passenger transport between Dissen and Osnabrück. In order to make this railway economically viable, the line should also be used for the freight transport of GMH which was until then done via the ‘Hüttenbahn’. 3. In the light of the information provided, the Commission considers that there is no indication that the two transactions contain elements of State aid. The value of the exchanged lands seemed to have been roughly equal so that the transaction did not lead to an advantage for Georgsmarienhütte. The same holds for the sale of the ‘Hüttenbahn’. In both cases the independent expert evaluation report, to which the Commission has had access, is based on sound assumptions. Therefore, the Commission comes to the conclusion that there is no indication that the Community legislation on State aid has not been respected.
