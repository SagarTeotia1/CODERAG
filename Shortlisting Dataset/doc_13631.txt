Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (30 June 2006) The Honourable Member is informed that there currently exist no Community statistics on crime or criminal justice. However, many Member States have good quality national statistics that could give an answer to questions such as these that purely concern the national level; it is therefore possible that the questions could be answered by the competent body in Greece. The Commission is devoted to developing a structure for measuring crime and criminal justice at the EU level, to serve as a tool for necessary policy purposes that could not be fulfilled by the current imperfect compilations at international level. In the medium term, the project aims at collecting available indicators and statistics in different areas and enhancing the quality of those; in the longer term, harmonised statistics on crime and criminal justice will be developed. A communication is planned to be issued by the Commission shortly. It will outline the development for the coming years.
