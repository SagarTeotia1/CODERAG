Question for written answer E-008042/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marian Harkin (ALDE) (12 September 2011) Subject: Societal impact of pain The societal impact of pain is an all-encompassing issue which needs a ‘horizontal’ approach by the EU. Not only does it affect the healthcare system, but also the employment and social services sector. In the event that patients suffer from chronic pain, they are no longer able to work to their full capacity, which in turn affects productivity at the workplace, could have negative consequences for the employer, and may result in the need for support benefits from the state. In addition, carers and families of the patient may also see their lives impacted by e.g. taking time off to care for the patient or suffering a loss of income due to the patient being the sole earner. 1. Is the Commission aware of any ‘horizontal’ work taking place to address the impact that chronic pain has on society? — Does it not agree that, especially in the current economic environment, a horizontal approach would be more efficient in tackling chronic pain? 2. What future action is the Commission proposing to ensure that the societal impact of chronic pain is addressed and reduced, not just in the healthcare sector but in other sectors such as employment and social affairs?
