to effective and efficient work against poverty. To achieve the goal of gender equality through the gender mainstreaming strategy, there is a need to combine it with specific measures in favour of women of all ages. ( 6 ) Women's contribution to development is achieved in the face of numerous obstacles which limit the outcome of their work and reduce the benefits for themselves and to society as a whole. The importance of women's economic, social, and environmental roles across the life course in developing countries has led to increasing international recognition that their full participation without discrimination is indispensable for sustainable and effective development. ( 7 ) The Community and its Member States were signatories to the Declaration and Platform for Action of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, which stressed the need for action against world-wide obstacles to gender equality and established gender mainstreaming as a strategy to promote gender equality. ( 8 ) The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women considers discrimination against women as an obstacle to development, and the parties to the Convention agree to eliminate this discrimination using all appropriate means. ( 9 ) Council Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 of 22 December 1998 on the integration of gender issues in development cooperation OJ L 354, 30.12.1998, p. 5. Amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1.) aims to support the mainstreaming of gender analysis in all areas of development cooperation policies and to support and facilitate the inclusion of actions addressing major gender disparities. It ensures that gender equality is promoted in national plans designed to implement major elements of the Beijing Platform for Action. The Regulation is due to expire on 31 December 2003. ( 10 ) The Declaration by the Council and the Commission on the European Community's development policy, adopted at the Development Council of 10 November 2000, states that gender equality is a cross-cutting issue. ( 11 ) The Commission's Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the Programme of Action for the mainstreaming of gender equality in Community Development Cooperation of 21 June 2001 (PoA) ( COM(2001) 295 final), sets the implementation framework for mainstreaming gender equality in EC development cooperation. The PoA was endorsed by the Council in its Conclusions of 8 November 2001. ( 12 ) In its resolution of 25 April 2002 on the PoA , the European Parliament stressed its commitment to gender mainstreaming as the approach to furthering the goal of gender equality and improving the position of women in developing countries. ( 13 ) This Regulation lays down a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Inter-institutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure OJ C 172, 18.6.1999, p.1. , for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. In general, EC development-related funding should also contribute towards gender equality as a cross-cutting issue. ( 14
