ORAL QUESTION H-0264/06 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Athanasios Pafilis to the Council Subject: Murder of member of the Communist Party of Ukraine Valery Yudin, a member of the Communist party of Ukraine, was murdered on 10 March in Nikol'skoye by a fanatical supporter of the 'orange revolution'. This act forms part of the increasing intimidation and violent incidents suffered by members of the party at the hands of nationalists. In recent weeks and during the run-up to the elections, there were numerous attacks on regional offices of the Communist Party of Ukraine and its members were beaten up. Does the Council condemn these events, which are the result of the broader policy of the Ukrainian Government - supported by the EU - which, inter alia, raises nationalism to the level of government policy, thereby inciting hatred among the people?
