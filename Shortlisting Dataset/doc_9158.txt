ORAL QUESTION H-0159/10 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Ryszard Czarnecki to the Commission Subject: Scandalous behaviour by the Dutch agency Jeugdzorg The Dutch Jeugdzorg agency, responsible for the protection of children and young people with problems, has illegally deprived the couple Jolanta van Beek – a Polish citizen – and her husband Cornelis van Beek – a Dutch citizen who is the biological father and legal guardian of the couple’s two young daughters (Monika et Oliwia) – of their parental rights and the right to see their children. Mr and Mrs van Beek have legal custody of the children, as their biological mothers confirm. The two girls are exclusively of Polish nationality and yet are deprived of the possibility of visiting Poland, learning Polish or meeting their father/legal guardians or their biological mothers in Poland. Does the Commission intend to intervene in this affair? If so, how? This is the second case of this type I have been informed of in the Netherlands.
