Question for written answer E-000038/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President / High Representative) Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (18 January 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Treatment of the Christian minority in the Middle East According to the Pew Research Centre on Religion and Public Life, the region in which Christianity began has the smallest ratio of Christians compared with other regions of the world. Just 4 % of the inhabitants of the Middle East and North Africa are Christian. Many Christians in the Middle East are forced to flee to EU Member States and elsewhere, in order to avoid problems in the free practice of their religion. In 2012, Christians in Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq in particular will be in danger. In Egypt, more or less extremist Islamists are acquiring more power in politics and society and the Al Nour party is openly attacking Christians. In Lebanon, the fear of civil war or even religious conflict persists. The example of what happened following the murder of Rafik Hariri and the withdrawal of Syrian troops, with Christian targets being bombed, is still fresh in our memory. In Iraq, the presence of US troops has made Christians in Iraq an easy target for fundamental Muslims. I would like to ask Baroness Ashton: 1. What action does she intend to take to improve the situation of Christians in the Middle East in 2012? 2. Are there any plans to provide funds from the newly established European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights to organisations taking action to secure religious tolerance in the Middle East?
