who is the rapporteur on the 2007 discharge, about possible fraud and the ratio between fraud and irregularities, Mr Caldeira said that the Court was not a judicial authority and could only notify others, i.e. the EU fraud-fighting office OLAF, when it finds clear indications of possible fraud. This year, the Court had done so nine times. He also stressed that 80 per cent of the EU budget is managed at the final beneficiary level by the Member States. More on-the-spot checks? In order to improve the situation, Mr Caldeira advocated more on-the-spot checks, although it should be considered, he added, whether the cost of making such checks would outweigh the benefits. The budgetary authority - Parliament and the Council - should take a political decision on what would be a level of "appropriate tolerable risk". Mr Caldeira also called for a simplification of the regulatory framework. Committee chair Herbert Bösch (PES, AT) pointed out that 2007 had been a particularly challenging year, as it was the first one under the new financial framework. It will also be the last discharge exercise for the Commission which had set itself the task of obtaining a positive statement of assurance from the Court during its term of office (2004-2009). The Budgetary Control Committee will now proceed to have a series of hearings of Commissioners. The final vote on the 2007 discharge is scheduled to take place at the April 2009 plenary session.

To strengthen the efficiency of the European Anti-Fraud Office and to clarify the legal framework of its mission, the report, drafted by Ingeborg GRÄßLE (EPP-ED, DE), asks the Commission to progress without any further delays on a consolidation of the legal texts on Community administrative investigations. OLAF staff should work in full independence The report also proposes that a human resources management be established, which is more adapted to the operational needs of OLAF, so as to ensure that staff can execute the mission of OLAF in full independence. Similarly, in order to reinforce complete independence, the Director General should be appointed for a term of five years, renewable once. "The Director General shall neither seek nor take instructions from any government or any institution, body, office or agency in the performance of his duties with regard to the opening and carrying out of external
