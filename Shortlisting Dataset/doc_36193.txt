WRITTEN QUESTION E-2729/08 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Council (14 May 2008) Subject: Malpractice by the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency in connection with invitations to tender The report by the Court of Auditors OJ C 309, 19.12.2007, p. 6. on the annual accounts of the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency states: ‘In one procurement procedure for a framework contract (value over 4 years: EUR 400000 ), the Agency received two tenders. One was rejected by the opening committee on the basis that its reception was late whereas it was not. The contract was awarded to the second tender received, even though it obtained a very low score for the quality evaluation.’ 1. Is this disregard for the law in force acceptable? 2. What services or goods were to be supplied by the successful tenderer in this case? 3. On what date was it by decided, by what body, to issue an invitation to tender in this case? 4. On what date were the necessary documents published for this, and what was the deadline for submission of tenders? 5. On what date was the tender received, and from whom, which was received on time but wrongly rejected on the basis of having been received late? 6. Who were the members of the ‘opening committee’ which therefore rejected this tender unlawfully? 7. Did the Agency endorse this decision and if so, who was part of it at the time? 8. What consequences will this have for its members, and what measures are being taken to prevent any recurrence? 9. Who was the second tenderer who was then wrongly awarded the contract?
