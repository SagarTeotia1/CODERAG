Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2011) As regards the transposition of the entire Directive 2011/7/EU, no Member State has informed the Commission of a full transposition. However, several Member States have informally communicated their current work on early transposition of the directive. Further to the adoption of the communication entitled ‘A Road Map to Stability and Growth’ COM(2011) 669. , and by way of letter dated 24 October 2011, the Commission invited Member States to step up their efforts at a national level for the transposition of this directive for implementation by January 2012. With a view to assisting Member States in the complex process of early implementation of the directive, the Commission has also called an expert group with representatives from all Member States. The aim of the first meeting of the expert group, foreseen to take place in Brussels in early 2012, is at discussing outstanding issues to facilitate a smooth transposition and an early implementation. The Commission is not aware of any Member State that would apparently move towards further delays in implementation. Once the deadline for transposition has passed, the Commission will closely monitor the transposition of Directive 2011/7/EU into national laws. Pursuant to Article 258 TFEU infringement procedures will be initiated in the event of either failure to communicate national transposition measures or incorrect transposition.
