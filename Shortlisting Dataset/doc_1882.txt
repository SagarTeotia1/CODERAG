as a result of the improper application of the Valencian Land Law (Ley reguladora de la actividad urbanística – LRAU), B. whereas a report was drawn up by the Committee on Petitions on this subject in May 2004 setting out, in particular, specific cases illustrating serious and persistent violations of human rights and Community law, C. whereas a new delegation appointed for a follow-up mission to that of May 2004 by the Committee on Petitions has continued the investigations carried out in particular in Madrid and in the region of Valencia in June 2005, in order to gather information and conduct interviews with the interested parties and key players, D. whereas the members of the delegation thus had an opportunity to hear the parties concerned, including: – the European citizens and residents who have petitioned Parliament alleging systematic violation of their rights as a result of the application of the LRAU, – the president of the Valencian regional government and the responsible ministers, the president of the Valencian parliament (Cortes Valencianas) and the political group leaders, the Valencian ombudsman (Sindic de Greuges) and the national ombudsman (Defensor del Pueblo), senior government officials from Madrid and Valencia, the federation of mayors of the Valencian region, representatives of the construction industry and property developers, the ambassadors of the Member States and many other interested parties, – and, lastly, representatives of the Constitutional Court and the president of the Court of Valencia who without exception cooperated with openness and goodwill, thus showing a spirit of constructive cooperation which is greatly appreciated, E. whereas the competence and responsibility of the autonomous regional authorities and of the Spanish national authorities are clear and recognised in this matter and that they are enshrined in the provisions of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and, more particularly, for the matter under consideration, in Articles 10, 18, 33, 45, 47, 54, 93 and 105 thereof, F. whereas the European institutions have the duty to enforce the provisions of the treaties and of the legislation adopted thereunder, having particular regard to the rights and obligations of European citizenship, and accordingly have a responsibility, in cooperation with the Member States, for resolving the problems affecting Europe’s citizens, G. whereas current property law in Spain grants property owners 90 % of construction rights and the specific nature of the LRAU requires property owners, in the event of the approval of a land development project ( Plan de actuación integrada – PAI) by a local authority, to cede a minimum of 10 % of their property to the municipality as ‘Patrimonio Municipal Suelo’ (municipal land asset), together with the land for any paths, roads, car parks etc., public areas and public facilities, or pay development costs decided by the developer of that new infrastructure, a procedure over which the owner has no control, H. whereas it is plain that some property owners have in fact been harmed by this process of land development, which is apparent both from the petitions and on the ground, and whereas these facts are recognised by all the local authorities
