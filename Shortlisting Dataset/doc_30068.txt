Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2012) Responsibility for ensuring that products placed on the EU market comply with all applicable requirements, and are safe, lies first and foremost with manufacturers and importers. Responsibility for enforcing the legislation lies with the Member States. Under the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety, OJ L 011 , 15.1.2002, p. 4-17. , national authorities must ensure that producers and distributors comply with their obligations. The Commission is in contact with the Italian authorities in relation to the issue mentioned by the Honourable Member in her question. Information about this product and any corrective or restrictive action taken will be distributed to all Member States through the RAPEX system, if a serious risk is identified and all the RAPEX notification criteria are met. According to EU rules, sanctions are laid down in national legislation and are administered by the Member States. Penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Individual proceedings are carried out by the competent national authorities.
