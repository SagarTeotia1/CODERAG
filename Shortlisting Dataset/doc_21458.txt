ORAL QUESTION H-0273/07 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Michl Ebner to the Commission Subject: Legal framework for cross-border cooperation for Europe's regions Cross-border cooperation between the EU’s regions is of great importance, as policy areas such as trade, tourism or transport can be handled better at supra-regional level and thus promote growth and living standards in the EU regions. This also applies to cooperation between EU regions and non-EU regions, which by contributing to the economic and social development of these frontier areas are also helping to implement the European Neighbourhood Policy and security strategy. In view of its significance cross-border cooperation needs to have a clear and dependable legal framework at European level, so as to clarify current uncertainties in this area. What measures has the Commission been taking, or proposed for the near future, with this aim in view?
