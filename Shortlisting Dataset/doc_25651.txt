energy policy; however, that policy should not lead to the Communitisation and standardisation of national energy policies, but rather create more competition and benefits for consumers; points out that not only Europe’s strength, but also its security in the area of energy supply, lies in diversity; 42. Draws attention to the importance of the three key energy policy objectives, security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness, for stability and growth in the European Union; emphasises the need constantly to revise these three objectives in the light of changing circumstances and to strike a fresh balance between them; 43. Draws attention to the fundamental importance of sufficient, cheap supplies of energy for the competitiveness and growth of European industry; 44. Welcomes the Commission’s Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy, but underlines the need to acknowledge the ever changing conditions on the broader global energy market and highlights the importance of extending the producer perspective to a systematic approach embracing production, distribution and consumption in order to develop a European energy policy which can secure affordable energy for European businesses and private households; 45. Agrees with the Commission that an essential element of a common energy policy should be enhanced solidarity between Member States in order to deal with difficulties relating to the physical security of infrastructures and security of supply; considers, furthermore, that such enhanced solidarity would considerably strengthen the capacity of the EU to defend its common interests with regard to energy issues at international level; 46. Notes that energy policy, and in particular security of energy supply, must become an integral part of the EU's common foreign, trade development and security policies and calls for a common strategy to secure and diversify supplies and transit routes, thereby demonstrating solidarity within the EU; urges the Commission and the Member States, in this context, to take very seriously the real danger of a deficit in gas supplies from Russia after 2010, due among other things to the lack of investment; insists that Member States and the Union, in its energy-related discussions with Russia, press for the signing and ratification of the Transit Protocol and the ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty; is of the opinion that partnership and cooperation agreements should be used to create a stable but open regulatory framework in supplier countries and that the Commissioner responsible for energy should follow a well-defined mandate which sets out a long-term European approach to energy planning; 47. Stresses that the experiences of last winter and the drastically increasing energy demand of booming economies (i.e. China, India) have made it clear that no source of energy must be left unused in order to safeguard security of energy supply; 48. Recognises that nuclear energy is an important part of the energy mix in a number of Member States; notes the role that it currently plays in some Member States in maintaining security of electricity supply, as part of the energy mix, and in preventing CO2 emissions; underlines, however, that there are risks relating to its production and at present no
