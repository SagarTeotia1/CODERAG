Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (2 July 2007) The Commission attaches great importance to the observance by the Member States of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles on which the Union is founded. The Commission also condemns and rejects any manifestation of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and any other type of intolerance. The Commission remains committed to make full use of the powers conferred on it by the EC Treaty to combat these types of intolerance, in particular through ensuring the correct application of EC anti-discrimination legislation and by proposing a Framework Decision on Combating certain forms and expressions of Racism and Xenophobia by means of criminal law COM(2001)664 final. , on which political agreement was reached at the Council on 19 April 2007. Community law gives the Commission powers to intervene with a particular Member State only when application of Community law is at stake. The Commission observes that the Honourable Member refers in a general manner to a number of different issues, some of which stem from individual statements. The Commission is following the situation in Poland closely, in particular in order to assess the possible implication it might have as regards Community law.
