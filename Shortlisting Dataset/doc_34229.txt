Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (28 June 2010) The Commission is aware of the income volatility farmers in Europe are faced with, as well as the increased focus this has put on tools available for managing income risks. Many tools are already available, both within the CAP and on the private market, to help farmers manage income risks. Direct payments ensure a fixed revenue stream for all farmers, which provide a basic income support. On top of that, market measures act as safety nets in times of crises. One example is the recent strong decline of milk and dairy products prices. The market mechanisms could then act efficiently as a safety-net and helped the sector to withstand the price pressure and guide it to recovery. Other instruments in the CAP are available to help farmers manage production risks, for example the possibility for Member States to subsidise insurance premia and/or mutual funds through Article 68 of the Direct Payment regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 OJ L 30, 31.1.2009. ). Insurances and mutual funds can be very efficient tools in ensuring a continuous income stream to producers, when for example adverse weather conditions or outbreaks of animal diseases threaten farmers' income. Outside the scope of the CAP, farmers may use future markets to manage price risks. And of course, farmers may also take up insurances even if they are not subsidised from the CAP. Measures within the rural development programmes are available to support farmers training in how to make better use of these instruments. The Commission is currently holding a public debate with contributions from stakeholders on their expectations towards agriculture and agricultural policy and will present legislative proposal for a reform in the course of 2011. One question raised in the debate is what tools are needed for the CAP of tomorrow.
