Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (24 June 2011) As for the issue of criminal activities, raised by the Honourable Member, the fact that some people may abuse their position in a cult or elsewhere to exert pressure to obtain financial gain or other favours is prohibited by Member States according to their national laws. Any person suspected to use a civil (association) or commercial (company, etc.) vehicle as a front to carry out illegal activities is to be investigated, charged and prosecuted by national authorities whether these persons use a cult as a legal veil or not. Regarding the aspects relating to the freedom of religion raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission would recall that, according to Article 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the provisions of the Charter are addressed to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. In the matter referred to by the Honourable Member it is thus for Member States alone to ensure that their obligations regarding fundamental rights — as resulting from international agreements and from their internal legislation — are respected.
