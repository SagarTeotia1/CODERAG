WRITTEN QUESTION E-2372/08 by Claude Moraes (PSE) to the Commission (23 April 2008) Subject: Detention of Pastor Kutino in the DRC It has come to my attention that Pastor Fernando Kutino, a prominent Church leader in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who was sentenced to 20 years of prison despite much of the evidence used against him being disputed, is still being held under very poor conditions. Amnesty International considers that Pastor Fernando Kutino and his co-defendants, who were accused of illegal possession of firearms, criminal conspiracy and attempted murder, have been deprived of their right to a fair hearing by a competent, independent and impartial court of law. The organisation is concerned that the trial by military tribunal was summary and that some of the evidence presented by the prosecutor against the accused was extracted under torture. Is the Delegation of the European Commission in the country observing Pastor Kutino’s trial, or taking any other steps to ensure he receives a fair trial? Has the EU, with regard to the Guidelines to EU Policy Towards Third Countries on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, made representations on behalf of Pastor Kutino’s co-defendant, Mr Nganda, and impressed on the Congolese Government that information obtained under torture should not be used as evidence?
