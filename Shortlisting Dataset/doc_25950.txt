calls on the Commission to analyse in detail their full impact, in relation to the objectives and operations of the European Development Fund. Global economic crisis Under current conditions of economic crisis, and increased difficulties in accessing credit, the operations of the two banks are even more important, in relation to their provision of credit to the public and private sectors. In light of the European Economic Recovery Plan, the EIB has decided to "increase [its] lending volume by 30% in 2009 and 2010"; a move which is welcomed by the Parliament. The report calls on the EIB and EBRD to ensure that even in times of financial strain, that they are active in promoting projects which support renewable energy sources and combat climate change. MEPs urge the EIB better to monitor and to make transparent the nature and final destination of its global loans in support of SMEs. Parliament s tresses that monitoring mechanisms of the EIB's lending operations to all projects still need to be improved, in particular regarding EU environmental and social standards. 20090325IPR52551 Adopted text (click on 25 March) EN 1 LINK /activities/plenary/ta/calendar.do?language=EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
