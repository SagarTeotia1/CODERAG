ORAL QUESTION H-0150/10 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou to the Commission Subject: Financial monitoring procedures for the Member States Olli Rehn, the Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, has observed that the principal lesson to be learned from the crisis is the urgent need for more in-depth and comprehensive monitoring of economic policies and especially measures to identify promptly and remedy any imbalances so as to safeguard the stability of the eurozone in macroeconomic terms. Given that, under Articles 121 and 126 of the Treaty, the Commission is endowed with the necessary instruments and mechanisms to monitor the financial policies of the Member States, most of which have deficits greatly exceeding the 3% limit: Does it intend to step up the preventive aspect of monitoring procedures? If so by what means and methods? Will it make proposals designed to achieve greater economic convergence in the eurozone? Will it promote the structural modifications necessary for implementation by the Member States as soon as their finances permit?
