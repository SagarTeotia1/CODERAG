Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (16 April 2010) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Mission to Turkey informed the Commission that Ms Negar Aziz Moradi was registered with UNHCR in Turkey on 6 November 2009 (while still in detention) and interviewed for refugee status determination on 7 January 2010 in the UNHCR Office in Ankara. She is now currently residing in one of the ‘satellite cities’ designated by the Turkish authorities (where asylum‑seekers must reside until a decision has been taken on their protection status) and is duly registered with the Aliens Police as well. According to EU directives on asylum, the Commission is not competent to assess whether a specific asylum‑seeker may be granted refugee status within the European Union. International protection can only be granted on the basis of an individual assessment by the asylum authorities of the Member States, and only where the application is submitted in the territory of Member States. Therefore, the assessment of on an individual case of an asylum‑seeker in Turkey falls under the responsibility of the Turkish authorities and of the UNHCR Mission to Turkey. The role of the Commission is to closely monitor the development of the legislation, the practices and administrative capacities of Turkey as a candidate country to the EU. Within this context, the Commission notes that Turkey continues to maintain its geographical limitation on the 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees, which makes it impossible for a non-European asylum‑seeker to be granted the refugee status by Turkish authorities. This point is regularly raised by the Commission with the Turkish authorities within the institutional framework stemming from the Association Agreement. However, the Commission underlines that Turkey is bound by the principle of non-refoulement stemming from Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibiting the return of a person to a country where he/she is at risk of torture or of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
