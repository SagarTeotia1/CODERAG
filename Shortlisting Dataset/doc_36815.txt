ORAL QUESTION H-0836/05 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Zbigniew Kuźmiuk to the Commission Subject: Construction of the north European gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea On 8 September 2005 the Russian firm Gazprom and the German groups E.ON Ruhrgas and BASF concluded an agreement on the building of a gas pipeline under the Baltic. The pipeline is to run directly between Germany and Russia, thus avoiding the Baltic States and Poland. Poland sees this project as a threat to both its energy security and its economic interests, given that it places on hold the building of the second section of the Yamal pipeline through Poland. What is the Commission's position on the matter? Will EU budget support be provided for the project?
