abovementioned position of 26 October 2000; 2. Regrets that the Commission's report is incomplete and lacks recommendations and proposals; 3. Calls, pursuant to Article 192 of the Treaty, on the Commission to submit proposals for improving the functioning of the common organisation of the market which take account of the principles and amendments adopted in connection with its position of 26 October 2000 mentioned above, in particular with the aim of encouraging the concentration of supply within producer groups not only at national but also at Community level, alleviating problems connected with operational programmes and funds, encouraging organic and high-quality production in accordance with standards that exceed those laid down in European directives, limiting the adverse effects of concluding trade agreements with third countries, improving the regulation of the markets and, in particular, establishing a permanent framework of support measures for nuts and locust beans, ensuring a transition by extending current support measures; considers that specific measures are necessary for regions where, for structural reasons, producer organisations are very weak; 4.
