Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (18 May 2011) The Commission is not aware of the construction project. The question raised by the Honourable Member again confirms the need for a rapid comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem leading to the re-unification of the island and the lifting of the suspension of the EU acquis in the areas of Cyprus in which the Government of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.
