WRITTEN QUESTION P-2408/05 by Toine Manders (ALDE) to the Commission (29 June 2005) Subject: Credit card fraud It has recently been revealed that the details of nearly 40 million credit card holders have been stolen from American firm CardSystems Solutions, which processes payment transactions. The details stolen include the card number, the name of the cardholder, the expiry date and the three‑digit code on the back of the credit card (the credit card validation code (CVC)). Possession of these data enables transactions to be made via the Internet. The fraud was detected at the end of May, but has only recently been made public. This case of theft demonstrates, once again, that credit card companies are not keen to make fraud involving credit card details public. 1. Is the Commission aware of the theft from American company CardSystems Solutions, in which the details of 40 million credit card holders were stolen? 2. Does the Commission agree that the interests of consumers were harmed by the failure to inform them without delay of this fraud? If not, why not? 3. Does the Commission intend, like the US, to take action to better protect consumer data? If so, in what way, and by when? If not, why not? 4. Does the Commission intend, in the light of this, to require credit card companies to make cases of fraud involving credit card data public earlier and to better inform consumers about the susceptibility of credit cards to fraud? If so, in what way, and by when? If not, why not? 5. Does the Commission agree that Internet transactions using credit cards must be better protected against fraud? If so, does the Commission intend to draw up legislation requiring credit card companies to better protect Internet transactions?
