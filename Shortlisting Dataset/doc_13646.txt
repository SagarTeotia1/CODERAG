Question for written answer E-008018/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (12 September 2011) Subject: Illegal landfill sites in Greece In reply to my previous question (E‑004908/2011), the Commission indicated that it was monitoring the implementation of the programme of action submitted by the Greek authorities in December 2010 for the closure of all illegal landfill sites by the end of June 2011 at the latest. Since this deadline is now expired, can the Commission say whether Greece has effectively closed down all the landfill sites on time?
