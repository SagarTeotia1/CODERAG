Reply (30 November 2009) In line with Council Common Position 2009/314/CFSP OJ L 93, 7.4.2009 , pp. 21-22. , which has extended the restrictive measures against certain officials of Belarus until 15 March 2010, and suspended — partially — their application until 15 December 2009, the Council is currently conducting a review of the Common Position, in the light of developments in Belarus. The discussion focuses on the overall situation, as well as progress by the Belarusian authorities towards meeting the criteria set out by the Council in its Conclusions of 13 October 2008, namely respect for democratic values, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. In addition to the preparation of a decision on the visa-ban list, the Council is also discussing possible next steps in the EU's engagement policy with Belarus, aimed at encouraging genuine progress towards strengthening democracy and respect for human rights. The Council is expected to take a decision at its November session.
