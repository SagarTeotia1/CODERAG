WRITTEN QUESTION E-2779/08 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 May 2008) Subject: Programmes for sustainable local urban development in small towns in the Galician Autonomous Community (Spain) In its reply to my earlier question (P‑1984/08) the Commission does not address the main subject of that question, namely towns with fewer than 20 000 inhabitants. Instead, it focuses on towns which have between 20 000 and 50 000 (or more) inhabitants. Hence I shall ask the same question again: Towns with fewer than 20000 inhabitants account for 91.4 % of the territory of the Galician Autonomous Community and for 49.7 % of its population. Under what programmes does the EU provide funding for sustainable local and urban development in towns with fewer than 20 000 inhabitants in the Galician Autonomous Community? How much funding does it provide, and from which Community Funds?
