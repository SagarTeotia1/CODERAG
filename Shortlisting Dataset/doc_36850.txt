Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (19 October 2007) The Commission is aware of the El Pais article and the reported self‑disciplinary agreement which includes some 20 companies. However the Commission cannot confirm the existence of such an agreement. Internet operations in China are subject to considerable and systematic interference and control by the state. It is particularly worrisome that such practices seem to have increased and strengthen over the last months. The Commission intends to firmly raise all issues related to freedom of expression at the next session of the EU’s bilateral human rights dialogue with China, which will take place in Beijing on 17‑18 October 2007. The reply that the Commission gave to the Honourable Member in 2006 ( E‑0419/06 ) to a similar question remains pertinent; individuals and companies that operate in China are obliged to work in accordance with the rules that apply in that country. The regulations on management of online news services issued in 2005 stipulate that websites must get approval for providing news information (163 websites have been approved so far). The web logs and other websites that provide online message services should go through procedures in line with regulations on management of Internet bulletin board systems. The Internet Society of China, established in 2001, has drawn up rules and regulations to enhance self-discipline within the industry. The Commission is, nonetheless, convinced that the approach of active engagement through dialogue with the parties concerned remains the only option.
