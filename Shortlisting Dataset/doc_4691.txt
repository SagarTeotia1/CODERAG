and artistic significance and represent a valuable heritage for the European Union; 22. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the setting-up of a European Cinematic Heritage Foundation whose purposes should in particular include organising a cinematic heritage network and establishing links between those concerned by this (setting-up of databases, organisation of seminars of international standing, etc.), training in the professional skills of film conservation and restoration, promotion of key European films and circulation of catalogues (compilation of thematic catalogues and broadcasting on television channels, creation of DVD collections of films which form part of the European heritage, cultivating awareness of the European cinematic heritage, particularly at schools, etc.); 23.

Urges the Member States and applicant countries to establish national film academies, where these do not yet exist, or to support them, with a remit to enhance the prestige and profile of national and (indirectly) European films in the eyes of the general public, particularly by awarding national film prizes and selecting entries for major international film prizes, such as the European Film Awards and the American Academy Awards; 30.
