WRITTEN QUESTION E-2203/07 by Luca Romagnoli (ITS) to the Council (24 April 2007) Subject: New Italian law on the admission of immigrants — current Schengen agreements As reported in the 12 April 2007 edition of Il Sole 24 ore , the Italian Government (prompted by two ministers: Mr Amato and Mr Ferrero) and hence the Italian Parliament are due to pass a decree and hence a new law on immigration which will amend the current Fini-Bossi law. In essence the amendments will: — make radical changes to the transit centres for illegal immigrants; — simplify the rules governing the issue of residence permits; — encourage regular admission by allowing individuals and/or bodies and associations to be sponsored and immigrants to sponsor themselves; — make the system of annual admission quotas more flexible by allowing exceptions to the rules. In this connection, will the Council say: — whether (and how) Italy’s proposed immigration policy can be reconciled with the Schengen Treaty currently in force and in general with the need to ensure safe freedom of movement; — whether (and how) the implementation of the above measures — which will undoubtedly lead to an increase in illegal immigration — will have an impact on security by enabling potential criminals to enter Europe’s common territory; — whether (and how) — bearing in mind what happened when the previous Italian Government granted an amnesty allowing nearly 700000 illegal immigrants to live and work in the EU — the above Italian initiative constitutes yet another transformation as if by magic of illegality into legality, to the detriment of all EU countries?
