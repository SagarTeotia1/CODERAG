Reply (20 February 2012) 1. The Council recalls that Article 71 TFEU and Article 6(2) of the Council decision on setting up the Standing Committee on operational cooperation on internal security (COSI) OJ L 52, 3.3.2010, p. 50. provide that ‘The Council shall keep informed the European Parliament and the national Parliaments of the proceedings of the Standing Committee’. In the course of 2011, in accordance with this provision, the Council sent the European Parliament a report on the COSI proceedings from January 2010 to June 2011 12980/11. . The Council will continue to report regularly to the European Parliament on the activities of COSI. The attention of the Honourable Member is also drawn to the fact that the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security remain a matter of national competence in accordance with Article 72 TFEU. As regards the fight against organised crime, at its meeting on 9 and 10 June 2011, the Council adopted conclusions on setting the EU’s priorities in this area between 2011 and 2013 11050/11. . The priorities set out in these conclusions should be taken into account at European and, where relevant, national or regional level, when defining agreed strategic goals and via EU annual Operational Action Plans. The conclusions are a follow-up to the establishment at the end of 2010 of the EU policy cycle for organised and serious international crime 15358/10. . 2. The competent Council bodies meet regularly in order to discuss issues linked to the implementation of EU instruments of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. These bodies also discuss the follow-up to the international agreements to which the EU or the EU and its Member States are parties. In this context, the Council recalls that, from 1 December 2014 the Commission will be responsible for overseeing the correct application by Member States of EU acts adopted before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters See Article 10 of the Protocol 36 on Transitional Provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. . It should be noted that the proposed directive on the European Investigation Order 9288/10. which is the subject of current discussions between the European Parliament and the Council, will, once adopted and implemented, to a very large extent replace the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters OJ C 197/1, 12.7.2000, p. 1. which is being applied by 24 Member States and its Additional Protocol which is being applied by 23 Member States.
