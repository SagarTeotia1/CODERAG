Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (11 May 2011) With respect to a general answer to the question, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the reply given to priority Written Question P‑003007/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . At this stage the Commission is not in a position to provide information on the exact details of inspections and/or measures to be carried out under the planned stress tests. The envisaged structure of the risk and safety assessment will be agreed at the plenary meeting of the European nuclear regulators group (ENSREG) together with the Commission in May 2011. The protection of the general public in the event of a radiological emergency is a responsibility of national governments; there are no binding EU‑level technical requirements for emergency plans in nuclear power plants. The EU basic safety standards (Directive 96/29/Euratom OJ L 159, 29.6.1996. ) require the Member States to prepare for emergency situations and undertake protective actions if the situation so requires. In addition Council Decision 87/600/Euratom OJ L 371, 30.12.1987. and Directive 89/618/Euratom OJ L 357, 7.12.1989. lay down the EU requirements for communication and information to the public in the event of a radiological emergency. Any measures taken against a nuclear installation operator with respect to the contravention of safety regulations are a matter for individual national nuclear regulatory authorities.
