Question for written answer E-006441/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Koumoutsakos (PPE) (1 July 2011) Subject: Transposition of the European Framework Directive on Waste In the light of the fact that 3 billion tonnes of waste are created each year and that quantities of waste in the EU are constantly rising, in June 2011 the Commission sent reasoned opinions to five Member States (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece and Poland) calling on them to duly transpose the European Framework Directive on Waste into their national law and thus avoid the fines which would otherwise be imposed upon them by the European Court of Justice. The Member States concerned were given a two-month deadline to comply, even though the directive should have been transposed into national law on 12 December 2010. I should therefore like to ask the Commission: — What contribution does it consider the application of the directive on Waste can make to the protection of the environment and human health? — Which waste management procedures (waste avoidance, reuse, recycling and other methods of recovery or use) are creating the greatest problems for the transposition of the directive into national law? — What stage has transposition reached in the 19 Member States in which it did not take place within the time limit?
