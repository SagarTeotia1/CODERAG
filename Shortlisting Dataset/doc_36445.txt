It also covers vehicles used to contain goods, where the vehicle is itself carried on another vehicle. The existence of a code for this type of material does not prejudge the question of whether such materials are to be counted as "goods", this will depend on the rules for data collection for each mode of transport. 17 Goods moved in the course of household and office removals; baggage transported separately from passengers; motor vehicles being moved for repair; other non-market goods n.e.c. 18 Grouped goods: a mixture of types of goods which are transported together Note: this heading is used whenever it is not considered appropriate to assign the goods separately to groups 01-16. 19 Unidentifiable goods: goods which for any reason cannot be identified and therefore cannot be assigned to groups 01-16. Note: this heading is intended to cover goods where the reporting unit does not have information on the type of goods being transported. 20 Other goods n.e.c. Note: this heading covers any items which cannot be assigned to any of the groups 01-19. Since the groups 01-19 are intended to cover all foreseeable categories of transported goods, the use of group 20 should be considered unusual and may indicate a need for further checking of the data reported under this heading.
