amendments: ∙ the possibility of not strictly respecting the descending order of weight when enumerating ingredients used in quantities less than 5% (am. 13); ∙ the possibility of not indicating the composition of compound ingredients used in quantities less than 5% when the composition of the compound ingredient is defined in current Community legislation (for instance in the case of chocolates, fruit jams, jellies, marmalades and chestnut purée) (am. 5). In both cases the common position lowers to 2% the level below which the derogation applies rather than abolishing it, as had been proposed by Parliament. Your rapporteur believes that this is a fair compromise between the consumers' right of information and the need to allow the producers some technically justified flexibility to meet the labelling requirements. Finally, on two issues, the common position does not take into account the amendments adopted by Parliament in first reading. On the addition of lupin to the list of allergenic ingredients (am.10), your rapporteur accepts the Council argument that this issue should be better addressed in the context of the review of Annex IIIa and notes that the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food has already been requested. With regard to the exemption from the labelling requirement of processing aids derived from ingredients in Annex IIIa (am. 7, first part), your rapporteur is concerned that the labelling requirements of this Directive will oblige the producers to indicate on the label substances used in the production of foodstuff (egg derivatives used in wine production, for instance) which no longer have allergic potential. This would, as a consequence, provide consumers with incorrect and misleading information and would cause unjustified concern in people suffering from food allergies. It is therefore proposed to amend the common position with a view to addressing this issue.
