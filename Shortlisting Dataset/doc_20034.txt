WRITTEN QUESTION E-4171/05 by Ioannis Gklavakis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 November 2005) Subject: Measures to assist European poultry breeders Following the manifestations of the bird flu epidemic in the EU's neighbouring countries and the danger of it spreading further and achieving pandemic proportions, much has been said about the public health issues involved and a considerable number of measures have quite rightly been taken in response to this situation. However, it is also necessary to consider the situation of poultry farmers. Public alarm has led to a sharp fall in poultry consumption, with the result that the sector is at risk of disappearing entirely. Without immediate assistance, breeders will be faced with financial ruin and, when the market returns to normal, Community activities in this sector will have ceased to exist. Community breeders will have irretrievably lost their traditional market outlets both inside and outside the EU, while Community consumers will have to be supplied with products from third countries which will certainly not be of such high quality as Community products or as safe. In view of this: 1. What measures will the Commission take to assist the European poultry sector, and when? 2. What measures will it take to ensure that consumers are given accurate information so as to avoid panic and over-reaction, allay their fears and ensure that they are not deterred from consuming poultry products?
