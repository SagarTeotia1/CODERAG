WRITTEN QUESTION E-2483/10 by Peter van Dalen (ECR) , Louis Bontes (NI) and Johannes Cornelis van Baalen (ALDE) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Palestinian schoolbooks 1. Is the Commission aware of the publication ‘Onderwijs van Palestijnse Autoriteit moedigt aan tot heilige oorlog tegen Israel’ [The Palestinian Authority's education provides an incitement to holy war against Israel] by Prof. Hans Jansen? 2. Is the Commission aware of the content of the Palestinian schoolbooks co‑financed by the European Union, as described in Prof. Jansen's publication? 3. Does the Commission consider forms of education such as those described in this publication to be counterproductive for the Middle East peace process? 4. Will the Commission in future make the financing of Palestinian schoolbooks conditional on the elimination of such forms of anti-Semitism from schoolbooks? Can the Commission guarantee that if the Palestinian Authority refuses to comply with this condition, the EU financing of these schoolbooks will cease? 5. Will the Commission discuss the subject of anti-Semitic education with the Palestinian Authority and inform the European Parliament about these talks?
