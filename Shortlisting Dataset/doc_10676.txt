Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (29 June 2011) All EU funding is prepared in line with the provisions of the Financial Regulation. Programmes are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis by staff of the European Commission, independent monitors and evaluators. All programmes are subject to internal and external audits, and they are also subject to oversight by the European Court of Auditors which regularly audits the EU programmes in partner countries. These measures are taken to ensure that European funds are spent in a transparent and regular manner and produce effective and sustainable development results. Any suspicions of fraud or corruption are transmitted to the European Anti-Fraud Office which will then take appropriate steps as to whether an investigation should be opened. The results of audits and/or OLAF investigations may lead to the recovery of the funds and their return to the EU budget. Furthermore, by choosing the appropriate implementing modalities, the risk of corruption can be limited. Many projects are implemented on the basis of centralised management, which allows for a strict follow-up from the Delegation. Risks of corruption in EU‑financed operations are taken into account through applying the Financial Regulation, including in respect of grant contract awards, implementation reporting, audits, independent monitoring and evaluation. EU assistance is based on consultations with government, stakeholders, Member States and with other donors involved in the funded sectors. Careful assessments and consultations are made throughout the project/programme.
