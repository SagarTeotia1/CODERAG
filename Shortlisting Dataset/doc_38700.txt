earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter scale struck the Great Lakes region and, in particular, the towns of Bukavu and Goma and surrounding areas, which had already been badly hit by the conflict, causing deaths, injuries and substantial material damage, Q. whereas several humanitarian organisations have been forced to suspend their activities following the hostilities at the end of 2007, while health centres remain without supplies or have been abandoned by their medical staff, R. whereas Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has reported that the local and displaced populations in North Kivu are growing progressively weaker and that the continuing warfare is preventing aid workers from gaining access to certain areas which are in need of urgent food and medical aid, S. whereas malnutrition is a further aspect of the extreme vulnerability suffered by the populations now living in North Kivu and whereas the data from MSF's medical aid programmes offer an alarming indication of the scale of malnutrition in North Kivu, arousing fears for those families whom aid cannot reach, 1. Expresses its deep outrage at the massacres and crimes against humanity which have been continuing for too many years in North Kivu and calls on all relevant national and international authorities systematically to bring the perpetrators to justice, whoever they may be; calls on the United Nations Security Council as a matter of urgency to take all measures capable of genuinely preventing any further attacks on the civilian populations of North Kivu; 2.

Welcomes the holding of the peace conference in Goma, given the need to find a political solution to the conflict affecting the East of the DRC; underlines, however, besides the notable absence of representatives of Interhamwes (FDLR), the fragility of the demobilisation undertakings and ceasefire commitment agreed on 23 January 2008 at the end of the Conference and therefore continues to urge all parties to this conflict to work unceasingly for peace and to put an end to violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law, cease all attacks on civilians and allow humanitarian agencies to come to the aid of the civilian population; 5.
