Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (12 January 2012) 1. The second programme of Community action in the field of health (2008‑13) Decision No 1350/2007/EC. is designed to fund cross-border actions aiming to help protect and promote health and safety and to improve public health. One of its main objectives is to promote health, including the reduction of health inequalities, in particular through exchange of knowledge and good practice developed in various Member States. Every year, the Commission adopts a work plan presenting selected priorities for action and criteria for the financial contributions to the actions of this programme The last work plan available, at the time when this reply is drafted, is the work plan 2011: Commission decision of 22 February 2011 (2011/C 69/01). , and launches calls for proposals for projects, operating grants, conferences and joint actions http://ec.europa.eu/eahc/health/index.html which are afterwards selected and evaluated. 2. The Commission is not aware of similar projects in other European capitals. Information on such activities might be available from the Council of European Dentists http://www.eudental.eu/ , a not-for-profit association member of the European Union Health Policy Forum, and thus a recognised stakeholder in the field of dental care. 3. The Commission does not have specific policies on dental prevention and care, which falls largely within the responsibilities of Member States and therefore does not collect information on the matter.
