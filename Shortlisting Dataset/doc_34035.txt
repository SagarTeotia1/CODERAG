WRITTEN QUESTION E-2999/04 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (25 November 2004) Subject: Discrimination against Portuguese workers in Scotland According to recent Portuguese press reports, the humanitarian organisation Citizen Advice Bureau has been urging the political authorities in Scotland to investigate the working and living conditions of hundreds of Portuguese migrants, in the wake of numerous complaints. These relate to, inter alia, low wages, substandard housing and the high rents demanded by the recruitment agencies. Can the Commission state: 1. whether it has taken any action to obtain full information on this unacceptable discrimination against Portuguese workers in Scotland; 2. what measures it will take in defence of these Portuguese workers' right to equal treatment?
