Question for written answer E-000433/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) and Barbara Matera (PPE) (1 February 2012) Subject: Failure by Enel to supply electricity to a forestry tourism business An entrepreneur obtained a 30-year licence from the Apulian regional authorities to run a small forestry tourism business, a lodge, in the Umbra forest, on the Gargano peninsula. However, the plan never got off the ground, owing to the lack of an electricity supply. For the last two years, even though the entrepreneur has paid the Italian electricity board, Enel, EUR 24 000, no electricity has been supplied. Initially, Enel asked for EUR 12 000 to install pylons, but the Gargano National Park Authority refused permission on the grounds that the area is subject to various environmental protection rules. Enel then asked for a further EUR 12 000 to lay cables underground. Despite the fact that the two payments were duly made in November 2009, Enel has never supplied electricity to the establishment, rendering the entrepreneur’s investment worthless. In the light of the foregoing, can the Commission say whether the entrepreneur’s projected forestry tourism business has ever received European funding designed to promote and support low-impact sustainable tourism?
