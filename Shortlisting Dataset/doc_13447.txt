Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (25 January 2005) As regards the issue of possible price discrimination because of the place of residence, the Commission has received full answers from 16 airlines among the 18 to which a request for information was sent at the end of 2003. Alitalia apologised for the incapacity to react due to its ongoing economic crisis whereas Olympic did not show any reaction to the written query of the Commission. Twelve (KLM, SN Brussels, British Midland, Meridiana, Spanair, TAP, Finnair, Luxair, Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and Austrian) out of the 16 respondents declared that they were not engaged in any of the practices related to commercial discrimination on the basis of residence. Two companies (SAS and British Airways) declared, in essence, that they stopped doing so. The Commission has carried out new test bookings on several of last years’ complaints showing that the restrictions entailing significant price differences seem to have disappeared. Price levels seem now to be similar for all EU residents; in some cases there are still differences in handling fees, but they are much smaller than the previously observed price differences. Nevertheless, the Commission will continue to monitor the overall situation. Given that the number of companies concerned is limited, it will take up remaining cases on a bilateral level should these discriminating commercial practices reappear.
