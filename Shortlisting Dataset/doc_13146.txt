Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (27 June 2006) Ensuring a proper cooperation between all state bodies and the Ombudsman and improving the follow-up given to his recommendations are among the priorities of the European partnership proposed by the Commission on 9 November 2005 and adopted by the Council on 30 January 2006. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia adopted, on 17 December 2005, an action plan for the implementation of the European partnership which foresees that administrative bodies should submit to the government quarterly reports on the implementation of the Ombudsman's recommendations. In particular, the Ministry of Interior should submit quarterly reports about the number and the outcome of the procedures initiated upon Ombudsman recommendations. In the autumn, the Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office (TAIEX) will organise a workshop regarding the role of the Ombudsman and his cooperation with the state administration, with the participation of the relevant national institutions and the Ombudsmen from the whole region. The planning of activities to be supported by the instrument for pre-accession is under consideration. It will duly take into account the priorities identified by the European partnership as well as the next progress report's conclusions on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to be adopted by the Commission in the autumn.
