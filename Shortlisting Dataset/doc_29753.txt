are likely to be ineffective, which could undermine consumer confidence, although the latter is a key element in the process of selling organic products. Furthermore, this Plan should have been seen as an opportunity to reduce the disparities between support for organic farming and for conventional agriculture. To leave it entirely up to the Member States whether or not they promote the development of organic farming in the framework of their rural development programmes is to run the risk of seeing the emergence of a two-speed organic farming sector and of exacerbating the already damaging distortions of competition. Organic farming deserves more than incentives to encourage a sectoral niche with limited aims. Instead, it should become the spearhead of a truly sustainable agricultural industry at European level, and this is the aim which the European Parliament must continue resolutely to support.
