Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (3 February 2009) Any decision in relation to the privatisation of forestry in Scotland is a matter for the relevant authorities there, subject to compliance with Community law. As regards any implications for the implementation of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 103, 25.4.1979 . or Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992 . that might arise from such a decision, the competent authorities would have to assure that both Directives are fully complied with, including in relation to Natura 2000 sites and also in relation to the species protection provisions of the directives. Should this decision have implications for current Scottish legislation for the application of the directives this would also need to be amended accordingly.
