ORAL QUESTION H-0211/10 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Ádám Kósa to the Commission Subject: Economic and employment guidelines The Commission is planning to issue fewer guidelines on the EU2020 strategy than has previously been the case. The justification given is that, although there will be fewer guidelines, they will be better defined and more precise, in the light of the setbacks suffered by the Lisbon Strategy. In my view, fewer guidelines might indeed be more effective, as long as we are able to assess the unintended as well as the intended effects and to prepare for them. In addition to defining the economic and employment guidelines, will the Commission provide the Member States with yardsticks? In other words, will it provide reference points to enable the unintended but likely (other) negative effects to be forestalled so that the harmful outcomes will not gain the upper hand overall, particularly with regard to the national characteristics of individual Member States?
