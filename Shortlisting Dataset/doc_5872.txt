WRITTEN QUESTION E-4256/07 by Ivo Belet (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (6 September 2007) Subject: Ban on transport of poultry and impact on pigeon racing At the start of July, following an isolated case of avian influenza in eastern France, the French Ministry of Agriculture imposed a total ban throughout French territory on transporting and gathering poultry. Homing or racing pigeons fall within the category of poultry in France (in contrast to countries such as Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). The measures imposed in France mean that homing pigeons are no longer allowed to be released in France, which is posing serious problems for pigeon racing in Europe. This is despite the fact that homing pigeons — which remain in the air and rarely or never land during races — run almost no risk of becoming infected with avian influenza. In other countries where avian influenza has been found, for example in Germany, no restrictions have been placed on pigeon racing. Does the Commission believe it would be desirable to harmonise relevant national provisions more closely, in order to prevent racing pigeon fanciers, for example, from being hindered, in a way that is unforeseen, from pursuing their sport?
