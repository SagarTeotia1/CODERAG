ORAL QUESTION H-1039/06 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Athanasios Pafilis to the Commission Subject: Unscientific and dangerous theories The Polish State Secretary for Education has stated that the theory of evolution is nothing more than a literary fable. Moreover, the Polish Minister for Education has refused to condemn this provocative and unscientific approach, thus paving the way for medieval notions which contest a theory confirmed by all scientific data during the last 160 years since it was formulated, and promoting the model used in a significant number of schools in the USA where teaching of the theory of evolution has been replaced, with government encouragement, by various bigoted religious theories. Does the Commission condemn this method of eliminating the theory of evolution from school textbooks as a reactionary and retrograde distortion of scientific truth? Will it defend the principle that teaching about nature and society in school should be based on scientific and historically factual approaches?
