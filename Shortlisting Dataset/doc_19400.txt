view that one priority should be to fight poverty by reforming the macroeconomic, monetary, social and labour market policies that are its root causes, with a view to guaranteeing economic and social justice for women, by reconsidering the methods used to determine the poverty rate and by pursuing strategies to promote fair distribution of income, guarantee a minimum income and decent wages and pensions, create more high-quality jobs coupled with rights for women, enable women and girls to benefit from public services of a high standard, and improve welfare provision and neighbourhood services, including crèches, nursery schools, kindergartens, day centres, community leisure and family support centres and ‘intergenerational centres’, making these accessible to women, men, children and older people as a whole, with a particular focus on assistance for older women living alone; 46. Stresses that the poorest women should be the leading partners in formulating, implementing and assessing equal opportunities policies; invites the Union, therefore, to pay particular attention to the planning and implementation of the European Year against Poverty, the European Year of Volunteering, and the Europe 2020 Strategy in general from this perspective; 47. Emphasises the positive effect of gender equality on economic growth; points out in this respect that some studies estimate that, if the employment, part-time employment and productivity rates for women were similar to those for men, GDP would increase by 30%; 48. Calls on the Member States to analyse the effects of measures to combat the crisis and future exit strategies from the point of view of gender equality; 49. Calls on the Commission to eliminate gaps in the areas covered in order to ensure the same level of legal protection against gender-based discrimination as against discrimination on the basis of race, and to improve legal protection and access to legal remedies for victims of multiple discrimination; 50. Maintains that measures need to be taken as a matter of urgency to combat wage discrimination, whether by revising the existing directive, by drawing up phased industry-wide plans with clear-cut goals – such as narrowing the pay gap to 0-5% by 2020 – aimed at doing away with direct and indirect forms of discrimination, or by encouraging collective bargaining and the training of equality advisers, addressing the unequal share of unpaid work between women and men and laying down equality plans for factories and other workplaces; takes the view that transparent wage composition should be standard practice with a view to strengthening the negotiating position of women workers; 51. Welcomes the fact that female employment in the EU is close to the target of 60% by 2010, but is adamant that a more ambitious figure of 75% by 2020 now needs to be set; 52. Demands that specific measures be taken by the Council, the Commission and the EU Member States to improve the position of especially vulnerable groups, such as an independent status for migrant women faced with domestic violence, individualised entitlements to pensions and other benefits for women with no or little labour market participation and a campaign to raise awareness of discrimination against transgender
