Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (4 April 2007) The Honourable Member would appear to be referring to the fee provided for in Section 8 of the 1986 Control of Dogs Act Number 32 of 1986: Control of dogs Act, 1986 an act to provide for the licensing and control of dogs and to provide for the protection of livestock from worrying by dogs and otherwise to amend and extend the law relating to dogs; and to provide for certain other matters connected therewith. . The Secretariat General of the Commission received a complaint concerning this matter on 8 March 2007. According to the complainant, Section 2 of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to keep a dog unless he holds a dog license. Section 3 of the Act appoints local authorities with the task of issuing such licenses. Section 7 of the Act provides that such licenses are valid for a period of 12 months from the date of issue. Section 8 of the Act requires a fee of 5 pounds (now EUR 15) to be paid to the local authority in respect of the issue of a dog license. Given its very recent arrival, the Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether requiring the fee to be paid also in respect of sheepdogs temporarily imported from Northern Ireland may constitute a breach of Ireland's Community obligations.
