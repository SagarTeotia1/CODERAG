Reply (15 September 2010) The Council has closely followed the events in Kyrgyzstan to which the Honourable Member refers. The Council discussed Kyrgyzstan on 26 April Council press release 8979/10 of 26 April 2010. and again at its meeting on 14 June 2010, following the most recent developments Council press release 11022/10 of 14 June 2010. . In its conclusions of 14 June, the Council expressed its serious concern over the violent confrontation in the south of Kyrgyzstan, which had led to a significant number of casualties. The Council has consistently underlined that restoring stability and constitutional order are key priorities for the country, which the EU stands ready to support with political, humanitarian, and other assistance measures. In April, in the margins of the EU‑Central Asia Foreign Ministers' meeting, the EU held an informal meeting with the Acting Foreign Minister of the Provisional Government in order to discuss the Provisional Government’s action plan for re-establishing constitutional order and strengthening the rule of law and human rights in the country. The Council and the High Representative have also been in close contact on this issue with the UN, OSCE and other relevant international organisations and regional actors, including the Russian Federation, the US and Kyrgyzstan’s regional neighbours. Following the violent clashes in South Kyrgyzstan in June, EUSR Morel has twice been to the country (on 16‑17 June and 2‑4 July) and has had extensive discussions with the Kyrgyz authorities and other national and international stakeholders, including on the issue of inter-ethnic reconciliation and rebuilding trust between law enforcement forces and the local population. He is also working actively to this end in Brussels. The Council is currently examining a range of options for further action to be taken in response to the crisis in Kyrgyzstan.
