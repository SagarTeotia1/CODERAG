budget line 08 20 01 : Euratom - Nuclear fission and radiation protection Justification for placing 30% of appropriations in reserve and conditions for release: In its Annual Activity Report 2005, referred to in the Synthesis Report of the Commission (COM(2006)277final), DG Research expresses a reservation concerning the verification of the exactitude of the costs as declared by beneficiaries concerning contracts under the 5th Framework Programme for Research. The exactitude of these costs, and their conformity with the provisions of the research contracts, cannot be completely and accurately verified by the Commission as part of its normal checks carried out prior to authorisation of payments. Appropriations should be placed in reserve until the Commission addresses these weaknesses. Before Parliament's second reading, the Commission should provide information on the steps taken to address this problem under the current 7th Framework Programme for Research.
