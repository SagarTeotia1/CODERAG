Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) Since its authorisation at Community level in September 2006, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has continuously monitored the safety of the centrally authorised human papilloma virus vaccine Gardasil, as well as the other human papilloma virus vaccines Silgard (the same vaccine as Gardasil) and Cervarix. The EMEA receives reports from healthcare professionals via the Member States and the marketing authorisation holders, of adverse reactions that originate from the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as from countries outside the EEA including the United States of America. The EMEA monitors adverse reactions and whenever important new information about known adverse reactions or new adverse reactions are identified, these are added to the product information to inform prescribers and patients. For the answer to the remaining parts of this question the Honourable Member is referred to the Commission answer to Written Question E‑3731/08 by Ms Breyer http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB .
