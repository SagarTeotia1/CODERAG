regions with very low population density, cross-border regions, islands and mountain regions; calls on the Commission, however, to consider drawing up specific criteria that will make it possible to identify the above-mentioned regions and provide them with a level of aid commensurate with the scale of the problems they face; 7. Believes that the statistical effect regions must maintain their status as areas within the scope of Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty as already requested in its above-mentioned resolution on the third report on economic and social cohesion granting them the same treatment as applied to convergence objective regions by the general provisions for Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund; calls, therefore, for the maintenance of the relevant provisions in respect of the statistical effect regions until the end of the programming period, i.e. until 2013, without a review of their situation in 2009; 8. Appreciates that the Commission intends to use the unemployment rate as a supportive indicator for eligible areas to be defined by Member States under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, but stresses the need for indicators to be introduced which will highlight the various differences in regional development, thereby enabling the Member States to measure more accurately the areas' relative degree of prosperity and consequently their eligibility for support; 9. Notes the additional allocation of eligible areas for designation as having the status of areas within the scope of Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty according to the country ceilings determined by the Commission, which also takes into account variations in unemployment between the regions; as regards the total population ceiling, calls nonetheless on the Commission to adopt distribution criteria which take into consideration the relative disadvantages of certain Member States so as not to impose stiff penalties on the ones which still display significant and objective internal differences due in part to the existence of underdeveloped regions with the status of Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty areas; calls, therefore, for adoption of the same distribution criteria and the same correctives laid down in the current guidelines and for authorisation of the requisite modest increase in the total 25-Member EU population ceiling which is eligible for regional aid; 10. Considers that economic-development regions should be entitled to the maximum levels of aid intensity laid down in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, in order to prevent a sudden change in aid level from hindering their consolidation of the progress they have so far made; 11. Reaffirms that any regional aid covered by the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty must be part of a coherent and integrated regional policy of the Member States; 12. Asks the Commission to urge Member States to outline in a transparent manner both the economic principles and the statistical criteria which they intend ultimately to use to identify the Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty regions; reminds Member States that, in the process of defining Article 87(3)(c) regions at national level, local and regional governments should be consulted; 13. Asks the Commission to ensure that the competent authorities of the regions are allowed to apply the
