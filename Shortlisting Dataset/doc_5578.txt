Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2004) EU candidates are required to have achieved the ‘stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities’ (the 1993 Copenhagen political criterion) as well as to possess appropriate administrative and judicial structures that can effectively implement the acquis (1995 Madrid Criterion). In its 1997 Opinion the Commission concluded that ‘Romania was on its way to fulfilling the political criterion’ as its ‘new institutions are democratic and their stability now seems guaranteed’. By 1998 the Commission concluded that ‘developments confirm that Romania fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria’ and since then our assessment has continued to be that the political criterion is fulfilled. The Commission is well aware of the remaining challenges in the areas the Honourable Member raises in his letter, namely: corruption, media freedom, discrimination, the independence and efficiency of the judiciary, legal certainty, the use of emergency ordinances; freedom of information; implementation of the acquis at the local and regional level; money laundering; ill-treatment in custody; and the trafficking in human beings. Indeed, the Commission has not hesitated to highlight in the recent Regular Report and Strategy Paper those areas where Romania must still make progress. Nevertheless, even in these most challenging areas it is important to acknowledge the significant progress made since negotiations started formally in 1999. As such the Commission can recommend that Romania continues to fulfil the political criterion while continuing to urge the Romanian government to make further progress in precisely these areas. Indeed it seems likely that the pace of Romania’s future progress in improving the rights enjoyed by its citizens will be accelerated by its accession to the EU.
