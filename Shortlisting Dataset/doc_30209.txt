Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (30 July 2010) The Data Retention Directive was adopted by co-decision procedure by the Parliament and the Council further to a proposal of the Commission on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The correctness of that legal basis was confirmed by the European Court of Justice in Case C‑301/06 Ireland v Council and Parliament. The Commission considers that the directive is binding in its entirely, and therefore obliges Member States to have laws, regulations and administrative provisions in place necessary to comply with it. This obligation came into force on 15 September 2007, and for those Member States that used the option foreseen in Article 15(3), on 15 March 2009 for the retention of communications data relation to Internet. In Recital 22 the legislator, i.e. the Parliament and the Council, states that the directive respects fundamental rights and specifies that the directive together with Directive 2002/58/EC Directive 2002/58/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002 . (e-Privacy) seeks to ensure full compliance with citizens' fundamental rights to respect for private life and communications and to the protection of their personal data as enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. The directive will be in force until it will be repealed by the legislator or, possibly, declared unlawful by the European Court of Justice. In the evaluation of the Data Retention Directive pursuant to its Article 14, the Commission will also evaluate the impact of the directive on the privacy of users whose data are retained.
