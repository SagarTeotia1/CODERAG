Home Affairs visited, in March, Egypt and Tunisia in order to assess the refugee situation, explore the possibility of enhancing people-to-people contacts and of working together with the countries of the southern neighbourhood region to better manage migration and mobility. The EU will continue its support to these countries in their efforts to democracy and economic development. The Commission will make further concrete proposals at the end of May. In the meantime humanitarian assistance to those who fled the fighting in Libya will continue.
