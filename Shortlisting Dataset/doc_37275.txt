Question for written answer E-000551/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Marina Yannakoudakis (ECR) (26 January 2012) Subject: PIP implants Around 300 000 PIP implants made from sub-standard silicone have been sold around the world, mainly in Europe, with 40 000 fitted in the UK. It is estimated that 95 % of women in the UK were treated in private clinics. French, German and Dutch health authorities have all recommended that women fitted with PIP implants should have them removed as a precaution. — In the light of these events, does the Commission intend to increase vigilance on medical devices implanted in the body? — Will this issue be looked at in greater depth in the review of the Medical Devices Directive? — What is the Commission’s stance on pre-market assessment of products similar to the PIP implant?
