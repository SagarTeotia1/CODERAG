WRITTEN QUESTION E-2088/04 by Eija-Riitta Korhola (PPE-DE) to the Commission (20 September 2004) Subject: Introduction of a maritime traffic separation scheme in the Baltic The safety of shipping and protection of the sea in the Baltic would be improved if a traffic separation scheme were adopted for the main shipping lanes in international waters throughout the Baltic, from the Kattegat to the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland, and if an advanced traffic monitoring and reporting system were introduced for the region. These additional measures are already in operation in the Gulf of Finland by agreement between Russia, Estonia and Finland. Under such a traffic separation scheme, vessels entering the Baltic would use the southern zone, while vessels making towards Denmark would be confined to the northern zone. Might it be possible to introduce such systems throughout the Baltic and in other sensitive regional waters within the EU? If so, within what time-frame? How could the EU promote the introduction of such systems?
