the Internet and e-mail was used to engage a wide audience in the political aims of ensuring debt relief, better aid and better trade conditions for the poorest countries. The MakePovertyHistory campaign succeeded in having 650,000 registered supporters, who were not only informed about but also encouraged to take part in events and who were put in touch with each other to discuss issues and help with travel arrangements to large protest events, such as the one in Edinburgh on the eve of the G8 summit. Marielle De Sarnez, a French member of the European Parliament, who recently presented a resolution on the right to reply to weblogs and on a safer Internet for children, pointed out that during the French referendum campaigns the Internet did provide a forum of debate which the traditional media did not. She was also convinced that without the Internet the French "non" would not have been as overwhelming as it was. All panellists agreed that as a campaigning tool the Internet was used much more by those opposed to established views than those supporting such views. Gill felt that the web was a good forum for people to express their opinions. The possible unreliability of these views was not a real issue, he felt, as people need not trust only one source but could gather different points of view. On the question of whether the Internet could be a means to bridge the gap between political institutions and citizens, De Sarnez said the web could never be the only tool to do this. This view was supported by Zimmermann, who said that of those who surf the Internet, only 10% do this to look up political information. 20050912IPR00256 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
