cohesion policy must be a key element of the EU 2020 strategy and must be a policy for all European regions, thus further reinforcing the truly European impact of the strategy; insists that the basic principles of cohesion policy – an integrated approach, multi-level-governance and true partnership – play a key role in achieving the goals of the EU 2020 strategy and should thus be completely integrated in it; stresses that territorial cohesion must also be, in line with the Lisbon Treaty, an integrated part of the EU 2020 strategy; 27. Emphasises the need for the forthcoming reforms of the CAP and Cohesion Policy to be carried out with a clear focus on contributing to the realisation of the goals set forth in the 2020 strategy; recalls that the CAP reform by 2013 should be considered in that context to produce an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable agricultural policy focused on food security, climate change, territorial cohesion, environmental protection, growth and jobs in rural areas; 28. Stresses that fisheries (wild fishing as well as aquaculture) is one of the most important pillars of the European Union’s food security and that as such its sustainability and stability must be secured, so that it can in future contribute to the needs of more than half a billion Europeans through fisheries products in qualitative and quantitative terms; 29.

Urges the Commission to have a broader and more comprehensive approach in its external action in line with the EU concept of Policy coherence for development; reminds that the new provision of the Lisbon Treaty requests that the Common Commercial Policy shall be conducted in full respect of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external action; 32.
