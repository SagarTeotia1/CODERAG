WRITTEN QUESTION E-2686/07 by Philip Claeys (ITS) to the Commission (24 May 2007) Subject: Start of the 2007 European Truck Tour in Strasbourg The 2007 European Truck Tour, part of the campaign ‘For Diversity against Discrimination’, set off from Strasbourg on 25 April. A number of events were organised to mark the occasion at the entrance to the European Parliament, which 11 MEPs were invited to attend, one from the PPE‑DE Group, one from the Greens EFA Group, three from the ALDE Group and no less than six from the Socialist Group. Does the Commission take the view that this was a representative balance? Is the credibility of such an initiative enhanced by such massive over-representation of the left? What is the total cost of the 2007 European Truck Tour?
