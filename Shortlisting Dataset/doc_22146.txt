ORAL QUESTION H-0142/07 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Ivo Belet to the Commission Subject: Climate tickets - Compensation option in flight ticket booking procedures The Commission recently underscored its firm commitment to combating climate change by proposing legislation to bring greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The draft directive is currently under discussion, but will only come into effect in 2011. The Commission's stakeholder consultation on this subject made clear that en-route charges on aircraft emissions and impacts are regarded as the second most effective instrument in reducing the impact of the aviation sector on climate change. While airlines and airport operators might be afraid of a compulsory system (since this will increase prices for passengers), a system based on voluntary contributions would remove this concern. Such a voluntary contribution would amount to no more than 2 to 5% of the ticket price. The revenues from such contributions are invested in afforestation or renewable energy projects in developing countries. Would the Commission consider joining a voluntary system to include a compensation option in ticket booking procedures, so that Commissioners and EC officials can take their responsibility and compensate the emissions related to their flights?
