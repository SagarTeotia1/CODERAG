Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (30 November 2005) The Commission is aware of the rising oil prices and the impact that these price increases have on other commodities, like natural gas. The Commission is also aware that the gas-oil price link is seen by many market participants as one of the factors hampering the development of a competitive gas market. The Commission is currently investigating the impact of the gas-oil price link in a number of Member States within the context of its ongoing energy sector inquiry Case Comp/39.173. . This inquiry was launched on 13 June 2005 and is expected to be concluded at the end of 2006. In the context of the inquiry, the Commission has gathered detailed information on how gas prices are set in Europe. It is indeed confirmed that a large number of contracts link the price for gas to other indices than oil and its derivatives (heavy fuel oil, gasoil or heating oil). A number of first findings concerning this issue have already been made public by means of an ‘Issues Paper’ presented by the relevant Commission services http://europa.eu.int/comm/competition/antitrust/others/sector_inquiries/energy/issues_paper15112005.pdf . At this stage, the Commission does not want to draw any conclusions with regard to the question whether the gas-oil price link is compatible with competition law. The same applies with respect to similar practices that might exist in other energy markets, like biomass or coal. If any restrictive effects or cartel-like behaviour, like price-fixing, were identified inside or outside the framework of the sector inquiry, the Commission will take all appropriate actions to restore competition.
