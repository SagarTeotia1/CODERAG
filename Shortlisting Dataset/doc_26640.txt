Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (22 June 2011) Regarding the study cited, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑2714/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp by Ms Muscardini. As far as the monitoring of the market in general (‘market surveillance’) is concerned, Member States are in charge of market surveillance. They must designate an authority which carries out the task of market surveillance. The Ministero dello sviluppo economico is the designated market surveillance authority for Italy. The Ecodesign Directive 2009/125/EC OJ L 285, 31.10.2009. stipulates strong measures if products do not fulfil the requirements of the regulations adopted to implement the directive. These can go as far as having such products withdrawn from the market and/or the imposition of penalties on manufacturers and importers. The basic principles and procedures are defined in Articles 3, 7 and 20 of the directive. The Commission launches an infringement procedure against the Member State when the latter does not fulfil its obligation to restrict or prohibit the marketing of a product which does not comply with the provisions of the implementing measure. Moreover, the Commission has the task of providing (where appropriate) opinions on the decisions taken by the Member States in the framework of their market surveillance activities, and of keeping other Member States informed of decisions each Member State takes. The Commission encourages and contributes to cooperation between the authorities of the Member States responsible for the implementation of the directive.
