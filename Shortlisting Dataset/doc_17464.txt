Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2010) The Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union bring about amendments that should indeed facilitate the work of the EU on Policy Coherence for Development (PCD). One of the major principles of the Treaty of Lisbon is coherence in the EU's external relations. The ‘double hatting’ of the High Representative/Vice President of the Commission and the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS) are key innovations that will improve the ability of the EU to deliver on this goal. The Commission has made clear that it will contribute fully to this effort. The exact division of labour between the Commission's services and the EEAS is still under discussion. The High Representative has been invited by the European Council to present a proposal for the organisation and functioning of the EEAS with a view to its adoption by the Council by end of April 2010. Without prejudging the outcome of the discussions on this decision, the Commission's services and the EEAS will work very closely to enable the EU to deliver on the key goals of its external policy and to promote policy coherence for development as one of these key goals. At the same time the Commission will ensure that the necessary procedures and mechanisms for promoting PCD are in place and adjusted to the new institutional environment where needed. Impact assessments (IA) are indeed key mechanisms to promoting PCD. As in the past, the Commission will communicate systematically all IA to the Parliament. Please note that impact assessments can also be directly accessed from the following website: http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/ia_in_other/ia_in_other_en.htm
