obligations and sanction mechanisms, designed to avoid the financing of fishing vessels carrying out illegal fishing activities. It also provides more means to identify the legal and natural persons involved in such activities and to support exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission in that respect. Article 40(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 provides that: ‘Without prejudice to other provisions laid down in Community law pertaining to public funds, Member States shall not grant any public aid under national aid regimes or Community funds to operators involved in the operation, management or ownership of fishing vessels included in the Community IUU vessel list.’ This provision establishes a clear legal obligation for the Member States not to grant any public aid national aid regimes or under EU funds to operators whose vessel is listed in the EU IUU vessel list, which is managed by the Commission. Under Article 44 of the same Regulation, Member States are legally bound to adopt effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative sanctions to punish natural or legal persons held liable for serious infringements. In addition, Article 45 stipulates that accompanying sanctions may be imposed to those legal and natural persons, including the temporary or permanent ban on access to public assistance or subsidies. The Commission will use the means offered by the applicable regulatory framework in order to make sure that if Member States find out that a given vessel owner is convicted of serious infringements all available sanctions will be applicable. The Commission will also raise awareness on this particular issue in the Member States through the monitoring committee meetings of the managing authorities.
