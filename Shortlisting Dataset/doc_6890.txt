WRITTEN QUESTION E-3903/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (11 July 2008) Subject: Lack of pavements in the cities of Cyprus Cyprus has a high incidence of Road Traffic Accident (RTA) deaths. Many built-up areas in Cyprus, including areas in the major cities on the island, lack pavements and this is thought to be a factor contributing to RTA involving pedestrians. Could the Commission assist the Cyprus authorities in finding ways to increase the number of pavements in the cities of Cyprus? Is the problem more widespread in the EU i.e. does the lack of presence of pavements in other EU Member States constitute a significant hazard for pedestrians?
