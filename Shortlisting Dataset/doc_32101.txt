Reply (15 April 2009) Bilateral assistance from EU Member States to the Palestinian territories totalled over EUR 405 million in 2007. The consolidated figure for 2008 is not yet available but is likely to be of a similar order. Collectively, the EU is the largest donor to the Palestinians. In recent years, the annual combined contribution from the Community budget and EU Member States has stood at EUR 1 billion. The EU and its Member States made further pledges in support of the Palestinian economy and the reconstruction of Gaza at the recent International Conference in Sharm el Sheikh. The Presidency, on behalf of the Council, underlined the importance of providing humanitarian relief to the Palestinian people. It also repeated the Council's support for Egypt and its ongoing mediation efforts, as well as for the resumption of bilateral negotiations and confirmation of the Arab Peace initiative. The Council's consistent view is that the way forward lies in the political process, as laid down in the Roadmap, which represents the only means to achieving a negotiated two-State solution agreed between the parties, which would result in a viable contiguous and independent Palestinian State existing side by side with Israel living within recognised and secure borders.
