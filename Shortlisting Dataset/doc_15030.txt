comments · The rapporteur takes the view that safety should be the overriding consideration . Until now no satisfactory restraint system for side-facing seats offering the same level of protection as for front or rear-facing seats is on the market. This view is completely in line with the requests made in resolution B5-0338/2003 , para 6 and 7. To allow explicitly side-facing seats would be a wrong political signal. · However, it is important to recognise that there are specific needs in the market which require exemptions. Until now these exemptions (in this case side-facing seats) were granted by the national authorities for small series of vehicles or even individual vehicles, pursuant to article 1 and 8 of directive 70/156/EEC, modified by directive 92/53/EEC. Even after the adoption of this proposal for a directive, directive 70/156/EEC remains in force and the possibility to grant exemptions will continue to exist (see point 1, last paragraph). The mutual recognition of these exemptions would mean that many legal uncertainties will be eliminated for both producers and users of these special type of M 3 buses and will probably lead to the setting of common minimum technical standards.
