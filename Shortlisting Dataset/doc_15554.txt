on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007 ( C6-0299/2006 - 2006/2018(BUD) ) Section III - Commission Draftswoman: Anne E. Jensen SHORT JUSTIFICATION Introduction This budget year is the first year in the new Financial Framework period of 2007-2013. The shape of the Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB), especially in respect of Trans European Networks-Transport (TEN-T) has been set by the adoption of the Inter-Institutional Agreement on the Financial Perspective. There are a number of outstanding issues which need to be addressed within the context of the 2007 budgetary procedure including TEN-T and adequate funding for transport related agencies. The Council adopted the Draft Budget in July 2006 and it is on this latter document that your draftsperson will base her proposed amendments. Unless a compelling case is made to the contrary your draftsperson will introduce amendments to restore the amounts proposed in the PDB. She will also consider introducing other amendments based on her analysis of the PDB below and her discussions with other parties, including the transport Agencies. European Aviation Safety Agency (06 02 01) The PDB proposes a 15,6 % increase in payment and commitment appropriations for Titles 1 (staff and related costs) and 2 (infrastructure and administration costs) to bring them to a total of EUR 14 200 000 for each appropriation type. The increase for Title 3 (certification and other operational activities) is 6,3 %. The total for all Titles of EUR 24 530 000 in commitment appropriations is EUR 2 470 000 less than requested by the Agency. This total represents 35,5 % of the Agency's income for 2007. There have been problems in 2005 and 2006 with the implementation of the Agency's Fees and Charges system. A solution to these problems, which make income flow erratic, similar to that found for the European Medicines Agency, would seem appropriate. EASA aims to extend its activities in 2007 in Air Operations, Flight Crew Licensing and Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft. Questions have been raised in the media about whether EASA is adequately resourced for these tasks. European Maritime Safety Agency (06 02 02) EMSA has an increase in administrative funding of 13,5 % in the PDB but an increase of only 1,5 % for operational spending. Appropriations for anti-pollution measures actually fall by 16 %. Commitment and payment appropriations total EUR 43 100 000. EMSA is funded entirely by the EU. The Commission's proposal is actually slightly higher than the Agency's request. The Agency's main objective in 2007 is to establish a permanent "24-hour" operational centre. This requires 15 more staff. Coverage by oil recovery vessels will be extended to the North Sea, Irish Sea and Black Sea on the three year contract basis. This will complete the network. European Railway Agency for Safety and Interoperability (06 02 08) Administrative appropriations under Titles 1 and 2 rise by 12,2 % to EUR 12 400 000, commitments and payments while operational appropriations under Title 3, both commitment and payment, rise by 24,9 % to EUR 4 245 000. As yet there is no
