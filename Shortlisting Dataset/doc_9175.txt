Answer given by Mr Samecki on behalf of the Commission (16 September 2009) Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, OJ L 210, 31.7.2006. defines the ‘total cost’ thresholds above which an operation is classified as ‘major project’. In the major project application forms, under table H.1 in Annexes XXI and XXII to the Commission Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006, the total cost of a major project does include VAT. In fact, the heading referring to the cost net of VAT reads ‘sub-total’. Therefore, the cost net of VAT cannot be the ‘total cost’ referred to in Article 39. In the upcoming modification of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006, a footnote to table H.1 has been added to clarify that, for the purpose of determining whether an operation is a major project, the total cost to be compared to the thresholds of Article 39 Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 must include VAT regardless if it is recoverable or not. It should be noted that this new footnote does not imply a different classification of major projects. As a matter of fact, it confirms the existing definition of ‘total cost’ of a major project.
