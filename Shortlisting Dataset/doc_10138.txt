MEPs proposed making the following points on charging for infrastructure costs: the principles of the directive should only apply directly to Trans-European Network Roads - they could also apply to some alternative roads but only after consultation with local authorities; the weighted average toll definition should be widened to include costs for environmental elements, provided they can be objectively calculated on the basis of EU methodology; the Commission had proposed that tolls could vary according to various elements such as emission standards, weight, accident risk and population density. The Parliament added elements such as the objective measurable air quality; Member States will have to provide fiscal compensation for the introduction of toll charges; the revenue from road charges should be used for the transport sector as a whole. The Commission was called on to devise, two years after the entry into force of this Directive, a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensible model for the assessment of all external environmental-, congestion- and health-related costs to serve as the basis for future calculations of infrastructure charges.

The main aim of the draft directive is to tighten up checks and penalties for infringements of such legislation. Contentious issues are the percentage of days that have to be checked each year as well as the definition of infringements which would constitute a serious offence. Although the Parliament welcomed the directive in principle, it is proposing a range of amendments relating to the proposed checks. Mr Markov points out that the establishment of the European single market and the liberalisation of the road traffic sector has led to a substantial increase in competition. Transport enterprises have failed to comply with Community rules on driving and rest periods. Since rules on working conditions in the industry are still poorly implemented, Parliament's
