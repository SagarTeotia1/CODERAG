WRITTEN QUESTION E-2538/10 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Support for the construction of the Pisão irrigation dam One of the main points to emerge from meetings with farmers and councillors in Portalegre district was the need to build the Pisão dam in order to aid farming in various parts of the region concerned. The promise to build a dam dates back many years; and, according to studies already carried out, the irrigation scheme in question is vitally important from the point of view of agricultural development and of improving living conditions and counteracting depopulation. Which Community measures and means of support could help to ensure that the dam progresses beyond the drawing board to promote development in a sorely neglected area of the Portuguese interior?
