WRITTEN QUESTION E-5102/09 by Enikő Győri (PPE) to the Commission (21 October 2009) Subject: Extending the VAT cash accounting scheme to the building industry The problem of debt gridlock (‘chain debt’) affecting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within the EU has reached enormous proportions in Hungary. In the building industry alone it stands at HUF 400 billion (1.5 % of GDP). The SMEs’ situation is made worse by the fact that the Hungarian state is very late in paying firms working for it after they have completed their work, while the firms have to pay the tax authorities the VAT due on sales immediately. The tragic liquidity situation of Hungarian SMEs would be vastly improved if the VAT cash accounting scheme could be extended to the sectors most affected by debt gridlock. This would mean that the SMEs had to pay the VAT on completion of the work only if the customer had already paid the bill. Would it conflict with Directive 2006/112/EC OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1. to extend the VAT cash accounting scheme to certain sectors (such as the building sector) where such a measure would substantially benefit the liquidity situation of SMEs affected by debt gridlock, and thus contribute to the growth of employment?
