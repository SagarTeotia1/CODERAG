were announced. They warn that the lack of respect for democratic procedures may lead to a parliament unable to legitimise itself and a weakening of Iran's stance in the international community. It would also affect EU-Iran elections. MEPs remain convinced that continued dialogue between all the relevant European institutions and Iranian decision-makers, political forces and civil society is more important than ever. They would welcome a more active participation of the Iranian judiciary and the Guardian Council in the EU-Iran human rights dialogue. Parliament recognises again the positive move made by Iran in signing the Additional Protocol for nuclear material safeguards and hopes this will be ratified before too long. It also calls on the Council and Commission to work on joint activities with Iran to combat drug production in Afghanistan, drug abuse in Iran and illegal transit of drugs through Iran on their way to Europe. Finally, MEPs call on the Iranian Government to pursue a more active and constructive policy to contribute to conflict resolution in the greater Middle East region.

In a resolution adopted today, MEPs strongly condemn this murder and deplore all acts of political violence in Cambodia. They call for everything possible to be done to find those who planned and carried out this and other murders against prominent opposition activists. Such violence, they believe, puts at risks the rights of all Cambodians. Parliament calls on the government of Hun Sen to put an end to the ongoing impunity in the country and bring to justice those responsible for political assassinations. It calls for the Commission, Council and Member States to raise these concerns with the Cambodian government. In situation where the Cambodian parliament has been deadlocked since inconclusive elections in June 2003, MEPs call for serious negotiations from all sides to lead to the formation of a government which could put in place much-needed reforms and law enforcement measures to protect political and human rights activists from persecution. They urge that the parliament be enabled to take up its functions, not least to allow the ratification of the UN-Cambodia agreement on a special war crimes tribunal. MEPs reiterate their concern about child prostitution and human trafficking in Cambodia, whether for forced labour or adoption. Finally, they propose that an ad-hoc EU delegation should visit Cambodia as soon as possible to evaluate the country's political situation.
