Question for written answer E-001968/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Gilles Pargneaux (S&D) (20 February 2012) Subject: Hepatitis C: alarm regarding Merck Laboratory treatment The American pharmaceutical giant Merck, has been concealing a serious malfunction in its Hepatitis C treatment, the Libération newspaper revealed today. The problem does not result from the ViraferonPeg medication itself but rather from the syringe pen used to inject it. The alarm was raised in February 2011 by a professor of medicine, Albert Tran, head of the haematology unit at L’Archet Hospital in Nice. At the time, he noted in his unit that ViraferonPeg cured half as many patients as a competing treatment, Pegasys, manufactured by Roche. Aware of this blockage problem, in 2006 the American laboratory set up a helpline to give patients information, but without resolving the malfunction in question. The rate of complaints linked to the blockage remained extraordinarily high, to the point where the European Medicines Agency (EMA) began to analyse the number of incidents reported per quarter. However, it never requested the withdrawal of the product as it believed that the problem ‘did not raise concern’. — Can the Commission specify why the European Medicines Agency did not request that the product be withdrawn in 2006? Can it also indicate if it intends to do so now? — If not, does the Commission envisage the establishment of a committee of inquiry charged with evaluating the risks linked to the malfunctioning of the injector pens used in the treatment of Hepatitis C?
