Reply (7 December 2009) The most recent mission of a Council delegation to the Caribbean region was in October 2008, when the CARIFORUM Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) was signed in Bridgetown, Barbados. Most members of the Council signed the agreement in Brussels but some members were represented in Bridgetown by ambassadors from the region. The cost of attendance by members of the Council is not borne by the EU budget. The General Secretariat of the Council also attended this event in order to carry out its responsibilities as Co-Secretariat to the ACP-EC Council of Ministers. The cost of attendance by the Secretariat amounted to EUR 15 050.
