WRITTEN QUESTION E-0980/08 by Koenraad Dillen (NI) to the Council (27 February 2008) Subject: Belgian law and the European Code of Conduct on Arms Exports The (legally non-binding) European Code of Conduct on Arms Exports forbids arms exports to countries where there is civil war or countries that violate human rights. Criterion 2, for example, states that Member States may not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. Secondly, Member States must ‘exercise special caution and vigilance’ in issuing licences to countries where serious human rights violations have been established. Criterion 3 stipulates that the Member States will not allow exports which would provoke or prolong armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in the country of final destination. Originally the Belgian law of 5 August 1991 on the import, transit and export of military equipment and the associated technology stated that an application for an export or transit licence would be refused if the country of final destination was facing serious internal tensions that could lead to armed conflict, was involved in a civil war, was led by a government that supported, or made itself available for, acts of terrorism or drug trafficking, or had been proved to violate the non-reexportation clause. However, this law was later amended. Under the new law of 25 March 2003, it must be demonstrated, before a licence can be refused, that there is a clear risk that the exporting of arms will provoke, prolong or aggravate armed conflict (Article 4(1)(4)(a)). In addition, a loophole is built in: ‘In so doing, a careful investigation must be carried out into the nature of the tensions, conflict or civil war, and the identity of those responsible for them, so that adequate support can be given to the democratic regimes whose existence is under threat’Article 4(1)(4)(b)). Is the Council of the opinion that these amendments are consistent with the spirit and letter of the EU Code of Conduct?
