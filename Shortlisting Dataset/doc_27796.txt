9999/C Q999 E/202 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1126/04 by Véronique De Keyser (PSE) to the Commission (01 April 2004) Subject: Use of structural funds It would appear that some of the structural funds earmarked for Latvia are to go towards restoring castles and other property being reacquired by former aristocrats who are still in exile or who have recently returned to the country. These funds are therefore being used for the restoration of private property reacquired at reduced prices and not for the restoration of heritage sites open to the public. Some repossessions even involve the expropriation of schools. I am stunned at such a use of structural funds and would like to verify the accuracy of this information, which appeared in a television programme called Des racines et des hommes ( Roots and men ), broadcast by France 3 on 30 March 2004. Is the use of structural funds in the Baltic States monitored in detail, and is there any information that could be published with which to confirm or deny these claims?
