WRITTEN QUESTION P-2910/04 by Véronique De Keyser (PSE) to the Council (12 November 2004) Subject: Death penalty On 22 October the Polish Diet rejected a bill to reintroduce the death penalty (for certain crimes), by only 3 votes: 198 against, 195 for, with 14 abstentions. This tiny margin for rejecting the death penalty comes only six months after Polish accession. It is to be feared that a fresh bill to the same effect will be tabled shortly, since certain opinion polls indicate widespread popular support for the measure. What would be the attitude of the Council if Poland (or any other Member State) were to enact such a law, which would completely contradict the principles on which the European Union is based?
