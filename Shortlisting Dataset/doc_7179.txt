ORAL QUESTION H-0321/07 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Eoin Ryan to the Commission Subject: The regulation of soccer players' agents in Europe The European Commission is due shortly to publish a White Paper on sport. Presently, there exists a practice whereby a soccer player's agent can represent both the player and the football club purchasing the player. This is an unacceptable practice because the agent should only be representing the interests of the player alone and not the interests of the football club purchasing the player. Will the European Commission consider including within the provisions of this White Paper on sport a provision which will ensure that a greater level of transparency will exist in terms of the regulation of soccer players' agents into the future?
