Question for written answer E-011900/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Franz Obermayr (NI) (15 December 2011) Subject: Unpaid leave on personal grounds and rules governing EU staff There are thought to be cases in which EU officials on unpaid leave on personal grounds continue to receive payments from the EU institution for which they work and/or have the right to return to their jobs afterwards. This raises the following questions. 1. What are the general rules governing EU officials and other staff on unpaid leave on personal grounds? 2. Do the rules in force in their country of origin apply to people on unpaid leave on personal grounds or is there an overriding EU legal framework? 3. For how long can an EU official or other servant take unpaid leave on personal grounds? 4. How many officials does the EU have? 5. How many other servants does the EU have? 6. How many EU officials are Austrian? 7. Does an EU official or other servant have the right to return to the EU payroll if he or she has, in the meantime, accepted another job or is self-employed? 8. Do officials continue to receive payments from the EU while they are on unpaid leave on personal grounds? 9. If so, how high are these payments and for how long are they paid? 10. If EU officials have any other income during their unpaid leave on personal grounds, does this affect their continued receipt of payments from the relevant EU institution?
