inclusion through better access to employment for disadvantaged people. While the Commission fully recognises the potential impact of displacement on the TNT personnel concerned, it would again point to the ESF’s regulatory role, which is to support actions in the Member States, including those designed to assist persons threatened with redundancy or who have already lost their jobs. In this connection, direct recourse to the managing authority is the appropriate route, given its regulatory role under the shared management arrangements with the Commission in deciding on individual ESF grant assistance, including grants made available to TNT. 3. As regards the issue of quality jobs and good working conditions to which the Honourable Member refers in connection with the Postal Services Directive Directive 2008/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 amending Directive 97/67/EC with regard to the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services, OJ L 52, 27.2.2008 , the ESF’s role is designed to promote such quality through the fostering of more and better jobs. This follows the very same objective as laid down in the Postal Services Directive, which seeks to ensure that all postal service providers respect the terms and conditions of employment and social protection as laid down in the applicable national or Union law. Fulfilment of these objectives also needs to take full account of the numerous technological changes in the postal sector, which may result in the need for different skill sets then before and therefore re-training and/or additional training in postal companies such as TNT. 4. It is not within the Commission's competence to provide a comparative overview of the average hourly pay of new part-time TNT postal workers and it is therefore not in a position to answer the question.
