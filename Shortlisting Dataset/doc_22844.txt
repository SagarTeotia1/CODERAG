Question for written answer E-006458/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Aldo Patriciello (PPE) (1 July 2011) Subject: Universal charger for mobile phones At the Commission's behest, the European standardisation bodies CEN-Cenelec and ETSI have laid down harmonised standards for the manufacture of data-enabled mobile telephones that are compatible with a universal charger. Fourteen mobile phone manufacturers have signed a memorandum of understanding committing them to comply with a common standard for chargers used with data-enabled mobile phones sold in the EU. Those manufacturers are: Apple, Emblaze Mobile, Huawei Technologies, LGE, Motorola Mobility, NEC, Nokia, Qualcomm, Research in Motion (RIM), Samsung, Sony Ericsson, TCT Mobile (Alcatel), Texas Instruments and Atmel. The European standards, which apply as of this year, cover only smartphones and multifunction phones that can connect to a computer and to the Internet. They require an adapter to be provided for phones that do not have a micro-USB socket. Does the Commission intend to apply these standards to manufacturers that have not signed the 2009 memorandum of understanding? How does it intend to guard against companies engaging in anti-competitive behaviour, such as the formation of cartels, and passing on standardisation costs to customers? Are any incentives or support measures to be introduced for consumers and/or the companies concerned?
