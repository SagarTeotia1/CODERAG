Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) According to a preliminary assessment of this issue by the Commission, the clawback-tax is considered a direct tax, non-harmonised at EU level, to be paid by companies as it is not passed to the final consumer through similar mechanisms that are in place for VAT/excise duties. Therefore, one would need to examine whether there is any breach of EU legislation in the area of direct taxation. There is no apparent EC law infringement from a direct tax point of view for two reasons: a) clawback-tax applies equally to resident and non-resident drug manufacturers present on the Romanian market; b) there does not appear to be any difference regarding the calculation of the tax to be paid by the Romanian or by foreign holders of authorisations to release medical products on the Romanian market, which makes the tax to appear as non-discriminatory. Given that this is a non-harmonised tax, Romania is free to establish its modalities including making VAT part of the taxable base. The incorporation of VAT into the taxable base of the clawback tax will not make Directive 2006/112/EC applicable to that tax. Therefore Directive 2006/112/EC does not appear to preclude such a modality. The version of the clawback-tax that Commission discussed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Romanian authorities is based on the design of clawback systems in other Member States. The control of spending on pharmaceuticals is of paramount importance for the EU/IMF financial assistance programme as it directly and significantly impacts the sustainability of public finances and therefore the future macroeconomic stability of the country as they are the main cause for the build-up of arrears and the existence of unregistered bills in Romania's overall budget.
