WRITTEN QUESTION E-3761/06 by Janusz Wojciechowski (UEN) to the Commission (4 September 2006) Subject: Changes in the draft Community guidelines on state aid in the agriculture sector for 2007‑13 — Support for livestock farmers The draft Community guidelines on state aid in the agriculture sector for 2007‑13 provide for a number of changes with far-reaching implications for the future of the livestock sector in Poland. The Commission is currently working on a proposal that would make it impossible for any form of support to be provided to the livestock sector from national budgets. The proposal covers aid granted for assessments of the performance and breeding value of animals and the keeping of herd books (Section 15 of the current Community guidelines). Polish livestock farmers are concerned about the impact of this change, given that the Commission proposal would mean that state aid to livestock farmers' organisations would be discontinued. Is the above proposal really being considered, and is the Commission aware of the negative impact such a measure would have?
