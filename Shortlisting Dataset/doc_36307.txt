WRITTEN QUESTION E-2364/04 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (7 October 2004) Subject: Somatostatin: from prescription drug to hospital drug The Italian Ministry of Health ordered, by Decision No 755 of 26 July 2004, that somatostatin would no longer be available on prescription and would only be authorised for use in hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. As a result, many patients who use this medicine, e.g. as part of the treatment devised by Professor Luigi Di Bella, will no longer be able to obtain it freely. 1. Does the Commission have the power to act in relation to changes in procedures for the issuing of medicinal products? 2. If not, how does it view the provisions introduced in a Member State, prohibiting the free purchase on prescription of a drug, while no such prohibition applies in other Member States? 3. Does it not consider that the obligation placed on patients to apply to hospitals and clinics is abusive and coercive, or does it consider that this medicine entails risks if prescribed by the patient's doctor and bought in a pharmacy? 4. Does it not consider the measure to be contrary to the principle of freedom of medical care?
