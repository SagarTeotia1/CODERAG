Answer given by Mr Pielbags on behalf of the Commission (4 November 2010) The EU accords a high priority to helping children affected by armed conflicts. The EU Guidelines on Children Affected by Armed Conflicts http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/03/st15/st15634.en03.pdf#page=2 were adopted in 2003 and revised in 2008 http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/10019.en08.pdf . The EU is committed to addressing the impact of armed conflicts on children in a comprehensive manner. This is done through monitoring and reporting by its Heads of Missions, military commanders and special representatives from the Council. The Commission leads political dialogue with partner countries and exercise its policy through diplomatic initiatives, multilateral cooperation and crisis management. The EU use the thematic programme Investing in People and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Right's (EIDHR) Country Based Support Scheme, to fund Calls for Proposals and targeted projects. In 2006 the EU prepared a Checklist http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/06/st09/st09767.en06.pdf for integrating the issue of children affected by armed conflicts into the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) operations, particularly its missions abroad. The Checklist was revised and updated in2008 http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st09/st09822.en08.pdf . The EU has been consistently supportive of the UN mechanisms in this field, in particular the UN Special Representative for Children Affected by Armed Conflicts, the Security Council’s Working Group, and the 1612 mechanism. In addition, the UN Security Council is encouraged to refer to the International Criminal Court for investigation and prosecution, regarding violations against children in armed conflict that fall within its jurisdiction. However, precarious and unpredictable security situations continue to prevent the provision of a definitive account of violations and perpetrators. The absence of a clear and legal framework to base possible solutions upon is also another major obstacle in areas which are characterised by high instability and lawlessness.
