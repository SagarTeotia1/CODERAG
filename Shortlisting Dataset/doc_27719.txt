area, as envisaged in the Barcelona Declaration of 28 November 1995. SUGGESTIONS The Committee on International Trade calls on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Welcomes the Protocol signed between the European Union and the State of Israel, extending the current association treaty to the 10 new Member States of the Union and is convinced that the extension of the agreement may help to give a further boost to trade between the two sides; 2. Welcomes the arrangement reached between the European Commission and the State of Israel, adopted in the Customs Cooperation Committee, regarding the Israeli authorities’ indication of the place of origin of goods; 3. Calls upon Israel and the EU to solve the bilateral issue of origin rules as rapidly as possible, so as to open the way to the successful implementation of Paneuromed system of cumulation of origin between Israel, its neighbours and the European Community; 4. Welcomes the recent trade agreement signed between Jordan and Israel which is intended to enable the parties to apply the Paneuromed system of cumulation of origin, with obvious advantages for the parties concerned; hopes that similar agreements can be made with other countries in the region; 5. Is therefore convinced that certain commercial initiatives, such as a possible agreement on the Paneuromed system of cumulation of origin between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , as well as with other Euromed partners of the region, and the recognition by both parties of the relevant trade agreements with the European Union, may give the right impetus to the development of trade between the two sides which will have a positive impact on the current peace process; 6. Calls on the Commission to collaborate actively with the Palestinian and Israeli authorities so that, after the Gaza Strip is placed under the administration of the Palestinian Authority, it may be possible to find the most appropriate way of promoting the economic development of these areas, whilst making certain that all the necessary conditions, including that of security, exist for both sides, enabling Israelis and Palestinians to trade easily and fairly, and to prosper harmoniously within a single ‘customs envelope’; 7. Stresses, with reference to the 'EU-Israel Action Plan' in the context of the new neighbourhood policy, the importance of developing social protection and employment rights, and encourages the Commission, as part of its activities in this connection, to pay greater attention to social and employment policy, as progress in this area could make an important contribution to greater stability and peace.
