were strongly in favour of a natural, balanced diet and not necessarily the Mediterranean one. Italian chef Alfonso Iaccarino, echoed this view: "We need to return to nature. Simpler food, old traditions, diversity and quality! We should fight chemical foodstuff." It was also the general consensus that more education was needed in giving children the necessary skills to exploit the food around them. Many MEPs showed their support for the Mediterranean diet being adopted, not only as a model for food but also as a model for culture. Already a number of countries have applied to list the Mediterranean diet as a UNESCO World Heritage "site' - a move which could be further supported by a Parliamentary resolution.
