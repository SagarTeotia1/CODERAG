WRITTEN QUESTION E-6715/09 by Proinsias De Rossa (S&D) to the Commission (13 January 2010) Subject: Protection of workers' pensions As the Commission is aware, SR Technics, which closed its operations in Ireland earlier this year making 1 000 workers redundant, refused to fund its pension deficit of EUR 26 million with the proceeds of the sale of its leases to state-owned Dublin airport and refused to abide by the decisions of the Irish Labour Court, leaving workers with greatly reduced pensions. SR Technics is now in the process of establishing an aircraft maintenance facility in Malta, another EU Member State. Could the Commission indicate what, if any, EU funds were allocated to SR Technics in Ireland in the five years prior to its closure and what, if any, EU funds have been allocated to SR Technics to establish this new plant in Malta?
