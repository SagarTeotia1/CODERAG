Question for written answer E-011558/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (8 December 2011) Subject: Revision of Greece's GDP In October 2011 the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) announced in a press release that it had undertaken a revision of national accounts for the period 2005-2010. Given that this revision led to GDP being revised downwards and hence to an increase in the percentage debt and deficit for the years in question and given that the previous revision of GDP in 2007 had taken approximately one year and had required repeated meetings between the Commission, Eurostat and the National Statistical Service of Greece (now the Hellenic Statistical Authority), will the Commission say: 1. Who took the political decision to address the issue of revising Greece's GDP? When and why? Were the Minister of Finance and Eurostat informed about it through this press release? 2. Did the necessary studies take place, such as household budget surveys or other statistical surveys, which in the previous revision had lasted approximately two years? 3. How could ELSTAT announce through a simple press release that it had revised the results of the Greek national accounts for the period 2005-2010, when the procedure outlined by the Commission in its answer to Question E‑5184/2007 had not been followed by the European Union?
