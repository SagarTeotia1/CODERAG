Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (14 September 2006) The Commission wishes to confirm to the Honourable Member that EU legislation governing the labelling of food in general, and the labelling of food produced from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in particular, only applies to food supplied by mass caterers where the food is delivered as such to the final consumer. In these cases, food which is produced from a GMO must be labelled as such. By contrast, where the food has been processed or prepared before being served, EU legislation is not applicable. Labelling provisions for mass caterers such as restaurants and public canteens have indeed less impact on the internal market. Without prejudice to Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 which provides the possibility of adopting Community rules concerning the information to be provided by mass caterers supplying food to final consumers, Member States may complement the labelling provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed, OJ L 268, 18.10.2003. by adopting national provisions covering supplies by mass caterers. This was indeed already the situation prior to the entry into application of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and it had not led to difficulties for the functioning of the internal market. The Commission wishes also to refer to its previous replies on this topic (Written Questions E‑4049/03 by Mr Speroni OJ C 78, 27.3.2004. and E‑1702/04 by Mrs Figueiredo).
