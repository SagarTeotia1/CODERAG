space will be created that could be used to extend guarantee-covered lending to other countries/regions. The rapporteur is inserting a new recital to highlight this fact. (am. 1 and 2). The amount of loans of the accession countries no longer covered will, as has been stated, amount to € 2 127 million (corresponding to a sum of € 343 million to be paid back to the budget from the Guarantee Fund) (am. 3). It should be recalled that the mandate for the Community budget guarantees to the EIB (on these loans to third countries) is regulated in Council Regulation 2000/24/EC OJ L 9, 13.1.2000, as amended by Decisions: OJ L 292/41, 9.11.2001 and OJ L 292/43, 9.11.2002 , as amended. How and if to use this "surplus margin' in order to extend the lending to other regions/countries is treated in a separate report and proposal presented by the Commission: "Amending Decision 2000/24/EC to take into account enlargement of the EU and the EU's Wider Europe-New Neighbourhood policy" ( COM (2003) 603 final). Concerning the date of presentation of the annual report, the rapporteur considers that a change of three months would be too generous considering the annual budgetary procedure. In order that the Parliament can make use of the report before the summer brake, it would be useful to have it presented at least by 31 May. (am. 4) Finally, the rapporteur has on numerous occasions questioned the appropriateness of the technical parameters of the Guarantee Fund and considered them overly prudent. The issue considered has been the possibility of slightly relaxing the provisioning rate of the Fund from 9% to, say 8% and, possibly, also the amount of the EIB portfolio to be covered, from 65% to, say, 55 % or thereabouts. The rapporteur underlines that this reasoning is still fully pertinent but that it may perhaps not be realistic to make any major changes before 2006 and the end of the current Financial Perspective. The Commission should therefore carefully assess the financial parameters of the Fund and make proposals that are more in line with the real risks within the post-2006 framework. 16 March 2004 OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, HUMAN RIGHTS, COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY for the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) N° 2728/94 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions ( COM(2003) 604 – C5-0502/2003 – 2003/0233(CNS)) Draftsman: Marie Anne Isler Béguin PROCEDURE The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy appointed Marie Anne Isler Béguin draftsman at its meeting of 4 November 2003.
