WRITTEN QUESTION E-6423/09 by Morten Messerschmidt (EFD) to the Commission (4 January 2010) Subject: Prevention of CO 2 quota fraud A completely new type of criminal has been busy filling his pockets with billions of ‘green kroner’. Since 2008 alone, organised gangs and criminal networks have fraudulently obtained more than DKK 37 billion on the European market in CO 2 quota trading. According to Europol, the fraud in some countries has at some times accounted for up to 90 % of the total market in the trading of CO 2 quotas, which confer the right to emit a certain quantity of greenhouse gases. The fraudsters have reportedly bought quotas abroad VAT-free and subsequently sold on the quotas in other countries with the addition of VAT. Before settling the VAT payments with the authorities, the people behind the scam close their businesses down and the VAT money disappears. Does the Commission accept that the present CO 2 quota trading scheme is, on this basis, an open invitation to criminal elements? Does the Commission also acknowledge that such fraud undermines credibility and, in the long run, may sap the willingness of European taxpayers to contribute and, if so, what steps will the Commission take to put a end to such large-scale fraud? The Commission is referred to the article entitled ‘Klimasvindel for 37 mia’ (‘37 billion climate fraud’) which appeared in Jyllands-Posten on 10 December 2009.
