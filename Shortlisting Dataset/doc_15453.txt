sees no contradiction for budget lines on which the Parliament both places amounts in reserve due to some concerns about the quality of implementation and increases appropriations according to political priorities; reaffirms, in this connection, that it wishes to see qualitative value for money in all areas of EU spending; 13. Recalls the importance attached by Parliament to achieving a positive statement of assurance for funds under shared management; underlines its intention to ensure that, in line with the 2006 IIA, the relevant audit authorities in Member States produce an assessment concerning the compliance of management and control systems with the regulations of the Community; reiterates that Member States therefore undertake to produce an annual summary at the appropriate national level of the available audits and declarations; Pilot projects and preparatory actions 14. As regards pilot projects and preparatory actions, notes the increased ceilings for new projects set out in the IIA of 17 May 2006; proposes a number of new projects broadly in line with the priorities set out in paragraph 6 of the APS resolution; Agencies 15.

Regrets that the appropriations for trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) have been considerably reduced for the 2007 - 2013 MFF to a level lower than had been anticipated; underlines the importance of a clear statement from the Commission of its proposed priorities for TEN-T investment; awaits a satisfactory agreement with the Council and the Commission on a regulation on financial aid in the field of trans-European transport networks and priority projects to which funds should be allocated; 18.
