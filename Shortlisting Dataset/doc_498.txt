a view to improving the quality of the learning process and fostering the autonomy of learners. Article 3 Areas of intervention of the Programme 1. The objectives of the programme shall be pursued in the following areas of intervention, in accordance with the action lines described in the Annex: a) promoting digital literacy: Actions in this area will address the contribution of ICT in school and more broadly in a lifelong learning context, in particular for those who, owing to their geographical location, social situation or special needs, do not have easy access to those technologies. The objective is to identify good examples and build synergies between the many national and European activities, which address these target groups; (b) European virtual campuses: Actions in this area will pursue a better integration of the virtual dimension in Higher Education. The objective is to encourage the development of new organisational models for providing higher education in Europe (virtual campuses) and for European exchange and sharing schemes (virtual mobility), building on existing European cooperation frameworks (Erasmus programme, Bologna process), and providing an "e-learning dimension" to their operational tools (European credit transfer system (ECTS), European Masters, quality assurance, mobility); c) e-twinning of schools in Europe and promotion of teachers' training: Actions in this area will support and further develop networking in schools, to make it possible for all schools in Europe to build pedagogical partnerships with schools elsewhere in Europe, to promote innovative cooperation methods and transfer quality educational approaches and reinforce language learning and intercultural dialogue; Actions in this area will also address the updating of teachers' and trainers' professional skills in the pedagogical and collaborative use of ICT through an exchange and dissemination of good practices and the setting up of transnational and multidisciplinary cooperation projects; d) transversal actions: Actions in this area will address the promotion of e-learning in Europe, building on the monitoring of the e Learning Action Plan. The objectives are the dissemination, promotion and transfer of good and innovative practices and results from the projects and programmes and to reinforce cooperation between the various actors involved, in particular by fostering public-private partnerships. 2. These actions shall be implemented in accordance with the procedures set out in the Annex, and through the following approaches, which may be combined where appropriate: a) support for pilot projects, with potential for strategic impact in education and training practice, and clear prospects for long-term sustainability; b) support for the development of methods, tools and practice and for the analysis of trends in the design and use of "e-learning" models for education and training; c) support for innovative actions by European networks and partnerships designed to foster innovation and quality in the design and use of products and services, based on the relevant use of ICT for education and training; d) support for European networks and partnerships that promote and strengthen the pedagogical and educational use of Internet and ICT and for the exchange of good practice. These activities are designed to ensure that teachers and pupils are not only technically proficient at using Internet and
