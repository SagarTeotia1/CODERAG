Stresses that preparing the European institutions for enlargement of the European Union with up to 10 new Member States by 2004 will be the key political priority of the 2003 budget; notes that the challenge posed by the scale of what is the fifth enlargement far exceeds that of all previous enlargements of the Union; points out that additional needs related to enlargement will have a major impact on heading 5; recalls that the conclusions of the Treaty of Nice concerning the size of the institutions and their responsibilities will have an additional direct impact on enlargement expenditure and thus on heading 5; Institutional reforms 2. Considers that institutional reform will be another political priority of the 2003 budget; takes note of the various efforts institutions have made so far concerning administrative reform; takes the view, however, that real progress has not been achieved yet; stresses that administrative reforms should make the institutions more efficient with a view to enlargement, should further optimise the capacity of the institutions to fulfil their institutional and political tasks and should make the institutions more credible and transparent in the eyes of the European citizens; Heading 5 (Administrative expenditure) 3. Underlines the fact that, on the one hand, the ceiling of heading 5 has been under constant pressure over the previous years due to the integration of new activities; notes, on the other hand, that the financing of some new activities has been simply shifted from heading 5 to other headings due to a lack of margin under the ceiling in heading 5, a trend which creates budgetary and institutional problems; welcomes the Council's willingness, as expressed at the end of the budgetary procedure for the 2002 financial year, to examine these problems together with Parliament well in advance of enlargement
