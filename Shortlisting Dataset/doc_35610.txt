Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (6 February 2009) The Commission — since hostilities were ongoing in the Gaza Strip — did not participate in any talks relating to the process of upgrading bilateral relations with Israel. Regarding the Honourable Member’s second question, the decision to suspend relations with Israel in the context of the Association Agreement is a prerogative of the Council and the Member States. At the latest EU‑Israel Association Council in June 2008, it was decided to respond favourably to Israel’s request for a significant upgrading of relations. Nothing has changed in this regard.
