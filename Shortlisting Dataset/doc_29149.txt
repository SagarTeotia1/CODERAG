Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (21 February 2012) 1. Concerning data on consumption spending in 2011 in the EU Member States the Honourable Member is referred to Eurostat quarterly national accounts data on final consumption aggregates (namq_fcs_k) or annual data on final consumption expenditure of households by consumption purpose (nama_co3_k), the Commission autumn forecasts (http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/forecasts_en.htm), as well as the compliance reports of Greece, Ireland and Portugal (http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/index_en.htm). 2. The economic adjustment programme for Greece includes measures, which in the medium term will improve the economic prospects of Greece, its enterprises and households. In general, these measures are aimed at enhancing business environment by, inter alia , identifying and eliminating barriers for the economic activity (licensing, red tape), as well as liberalising product and services markets, and providing the labour market with the necessary flexibility to react to changing economic circumstances. The programme agenda of structural reforms will also help Greek enterprises to shift from the domestic market towards export-oriented activities, thus exploring new business opportunities and securing jobs.
