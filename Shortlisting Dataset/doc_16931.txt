Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (13 March 2012) The Commission is aware of the proposed sale of EMI, with an agreement for the sale of its recorded music division to Universal Music Group, and another for the sale of EMI's music publishing division to a group of investors, including Sony Corporation of America. One of these transactions, the proposed acquisition by Universal of EMI's recorded music business, was notified to the Commission on 17 February 2012. The other transaction, the proposed acquisition of joint control over EMI's music publishing business by Sony Corporation of America and the Mubadala Development Company was notified to the Commission on 27 February 2012. The Commission is currently conducting market investigations into both transactions in order to assess their likely impact on the various EU music markets concerned. The Commission is empowered by the Treaty to ensure undistorted competition in the internal market. The Treaty prohibits restrictive agreements as well as abuses by companies in a dominant position. These general prohibitions apply to the markets relevant for music providers See for example Case 38698/CISAC; Decision C(2008)3435 final. . The Commission has received no formal complaints on market behaviour of players in this sector, but continues to closely monitor developments in the market. The Commission will continue robust enforcement of the existing competition rules. The Commission is currently working on a proposal for the directive on collective rights management envisaged in the Digital Agenda for Europe. The aim of the directive is to improve transparency and governance of collecting societies and to facilitate multi-territorial licensing of online musical works for all music providers. The adoption of the directive by the Commission is planned for spring this year.
