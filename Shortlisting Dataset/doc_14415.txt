Question for written answer E-8115/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) (11 October 2010) Subject: Bottom trawling with bobbins During a recent meeting with representatives of the small-scale coastal and artisanal fishing sector, my attention was drawn to the serious impact of bottom trawling with bobbins. According to the fishermen, this practice has a devastating impact on marine resources and causes extensive, long-term damage to the seabed, making it incompatible with any sustainable use of marine resources. For these reasons, they believe this type of fishing gear should be banned. 1. Is the Commission aware of the impact associated with the use of bottom-trawling nets with bobbins, especially their effect on the seabed? What analysis has it made of this impact? 2. Is any restriction to be imposed on this practice?
