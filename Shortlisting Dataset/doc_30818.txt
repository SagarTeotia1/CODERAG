their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part, amending the Agreement in order to extend the provisions of the Agreement to bilateral trade in textiles, taking account of the expiry of the bilateral textiles Agreement (16384/2010 – C7‑0097/2011 – 2010/0323(NLE) ) Rapporteur: Nicole Kiil-Nielsen The Committee on Foreign Affairs calls on the Committee on International Trade, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its interim report: A. whereas Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Uzbekistan states that "Respect for democracy, principles of international law and human rights as defined in particular in the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, as well as the principles of market economy, including those enunciated in the documents of the CSCE Bonn Conference, underpin the internal and external policies of the Parties and constitute essential elements of partnership and of this Agreement", B. whereas, according to the Uzbek authorities, the practice of employing children in cotton harvesting is now limited to teenagers only, this practice takes place on private farms and is not a state-condoned policy and moreover forced labour is illegal and repressed; whereas however the level at which the Uzbek Government sets farm prices and centrally planned production objectives should be revised in order to take into account the existing limitations of resources so as to make full enforcement of the legislation by local authorities in the field a reality and to guarantee that the system will not exert any further pressure such that it inevitably relies on forced child labour, C. whereas the Council has stated in its conclusions on child labour of 14 June 2010 that it is fully aware of the role and responsibilities of the Union in the strife towards ending child labour, D. whereas independent international observers have gathered evidence of forced labour and in particular forced child labour as a systematic and organised practice involving pressure on teachers and families with the participation of the police and security forces, E. whereas fair international trade requires competition on a level playing-field and moreover the economic factors determining the pricing of products exported to the Union should not be distorted by practices contrary to the basic principles of human rights and the rights of the child, F. whereas water is an important resource in the 21st century and therefore its preservation should be a priority; whereas the production of cotton in Uzbekistan has caused a severe reduction in the volume of the Aral Sea between 1990 and 2008 due to poor environmental standards and inefficient irrigation infrastructure, 1.
