the competent authorities, taking into account known cumulative and synergistic effects . The properties of the active substance, and the possibility of exposure of different population subgroups (professional or non-professional users, bystanders, workers, residents, specific vulnerable groups or consumers) directly or indirectly through food, feed, water or the environment shall be taken into account. Other factors such as the stringency of imposed restrictions on use and prescribed personal protective equipment must also be considered. For the environment, taking into account known cumulative and synergistic effects , a factor of at least 3 between the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) and the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) ratios of different active substances is considered a significant difference in risk. 3. Significant practical or economic disadvantages Significant practical or economic disadvantage to the user is defined as a major quantifiable impairment of working practices or business activity leading to inability to maintain sufficient control of the target organism. Such a major impairment might be, for example, where no technical facilities for the use of the alternative substance(s) are available or economically feasible. Where a comparative assessment indicates that restrictions/prohibitions of use of a plant protection product could cause such disadvantage, then this will be taken into account in the decision-making process. This situation must be substantiated. The comparative assessment shall take authorised minor uses into account.
