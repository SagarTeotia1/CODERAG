WRITTEN QUESTION E-0500/05 by Albert Maat (PPE-DE) to the Commission (15 February 2005) Subject: Dimethylhydrazine contamination caused by ESA space centre Research carried out by Vector, the Russian State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology, has found that among children living in areas near the Baikonur Cosmodrome there is a much higher incidence of endocrine and blood disorders than elsewhere. This is the result of serious pollution caused by the rocket fuel dimethylhydrazine from the space station, which is regularly used by the ESA. Is the European Commission aware of these problems? Does it intend to take steps to prevent the European Union from contributing to this contamination in any way whatsoever?
