Reply (30 November 2009) The Council would point out that, together with the European Parliament, it has adopted Directive 2008/115/EC of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals OJ L 348, 24.12.2008, p. 98. . Furthermore, the Council has adopted Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status OJ L 326, 13.12.2005, p. 13. . It is for the Commission to monitor Member States' implementation of these Directives. Therefore, the Council is not in a position to provide information on the success rates and best-practice comparisons or progress achieved concerning repatriation, nor on unfitness problems in Member States, including the role of solicitors and supervisors. The Council recalls that the information requested by the Honourable Member on decisions on the cutting of funding need to be addressed to the European Commission.
