is highly unlikely that there is an effect on trade between Member States given the problems relating to the situation in the Scottish market where possible anti-competitive effects are likely to be concentrated. The Commission also does not see any agreement between undertakings or any sign of abusive behaviour by an undertaking in a dominant position on a relevant market, but rather the problems relating to alleged breaches of contract. As the Honourable Member may recall, since 1 May 2004 national competition authorities and national courts can also fully apply the EC competition rules. These authorities would be best placed to examine the matter further if the Honourable Member continues to believe there is a competition issue and the Office of Fair Trading in the UK will also be able to investigate any possible infringement of national competition law. National authorities and courts are also competent to ensure the application of other national laws implementing EC law, including the legislation on unfair terms in consumer contracts. The Commission cannot intervene in private legal disputes or investigate the commercial policies of a particular company in the light of EU consumer legislation. This is the responsibility of the relevant authorities in the Member States.
