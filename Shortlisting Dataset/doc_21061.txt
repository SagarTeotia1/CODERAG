WRITTEN QUESTION E-5448/06 by Michl Ebner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 December 2006) Subject: Expiry of credit on French mobile telephone top-up cards In France, credit on top-up cards for mobile telephones expires after a month if it has not been used at all or in full. In Germany, a comparable arrangement under which mobile telephone credit expires after 15 months has been declared inadmissible in two judgments (Munich Higher Regional Court, ref. 29 U 2294/06, and Düsseldorf Regional Court, ref. 12 O 458/05) on the ground that there is no objective justification for it. It is all the more astonishing that, in France, the expiry period is only one month. Does the Commission intend to have the French mobile telephone operators’ arrangement investigated, having regard in particular to the fact that an expiry period of no more than one month is an unreasonable burden on other Member States’ citizens who are in France for only a short time?
