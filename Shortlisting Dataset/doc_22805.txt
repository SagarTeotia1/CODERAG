Question for written answer E-6479/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Licia Ronzulli (PPE) , Carlo Fidanza (PPE) and Marco Scurria (PPE) (17 August 2010) Subject: Combating the ‘smart drugs’ phenomenon Many newspapers have reported that six new types of ‘smart drugs’ have been identified. More specifically, the six substances are: Argemone Mexicana (a type of poppy), Brugmansia Arborea (a shrub), Datura Stramonium, Muira Puama (a plant found in Brazil which has aphrodisiacal effects), Piper methysticum (kava-kava, a plant found in Polynesia) and Turnera Aphrodisiaca (a shrub that is widespread in Central and South America). These products often elude official classification and end up on the shelves of so-called smart shops, in the form of herbs, incense or pills and are also easily available on the Internet at the price of EUR 25 per dose. The most common effects which have so far been identified in those who consume such substances are: damage to the cardiovascular system (tachycardia, extrasystole), the respiratory system and the central nervous system, with episodes of visual hallucinations, psychosis and paranoia. The toxicity of these substances increases if they are taken by young people whose central nervous systems are not yet fully developed, with the consequent risk of cognitive, emotional and behavioural disturbances. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is the Community body responsible for collecting information with a view to developing national and European strategies. 1. Given the changing and dynamic nature of the drugs phenomenon, what new instruments will the Commission make available to the EMCDDA to help improve its activity? 2. Will the Commission develop strategies with a view to banning the sale of smart drugs, given that these products are increasingly consumed by adolescents?
