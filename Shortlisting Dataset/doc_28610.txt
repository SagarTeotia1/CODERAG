Question for written answer E-005860/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andrea Cozzolino (S&D) (16 June 2011) Subject: Identification and Expulsion Centre, Santa Maria Capua Vetere (Caserta Province, Italy) An Italian Interior Ministry decree of 21 April 2011 established an Identification and Expulsion Centre (IEC) at the tent city erected at the Andolfato barracks in Santa Maria Capua Vetere (Caserta Province). Directive 2003/3/EC and Directive 2001/55/EC lay down minimum standards for, respectively, the reception of asylum‑seekers in the Member States, and the provision of temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons. Yet when the author of this question visited the IEC on 22 April 2011, it was obvious that the facilities provided, being under canvas, were structurally unsuited to the provision of adequate services and conditions for the migrants being held there until their identity had been established. 1. Would the Commission ascertain whether the use of the tent city at Santa Maria Capua as an Identification and Expulsion Centre is compatible with Community legislation? 2. Would the Commission obtain all the necessary information from the government concerning the protection of the rights, dignity and health of the migrants and the local community in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, and intervene if legislation has been infringed?
