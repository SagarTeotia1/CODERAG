Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (1 August 2011) Following an application submitted by the government of the United Kingdom, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2066/2002 OJ L 318, 22.11.2002. supplementing the annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 OJ L 327, 18.12.1996. protected the name ‘Welsh Beef’ as Protected Geographical Indication throughout the European Union. According to the original product specification: ‘cattle are slaughtered between 24 and 27 months of age’. Commission Regulation (EU) No 97/2011 OJ L 30, 4.2.2011. approved changes to this product specification according to which ‘cattle are slaughtered at between 24‑48 months of age and must not have bred’. The explanation given for this amendment was: ‘to emphasise the slaughter age range for cattle to qualify for use of the Welsh Beef PGI. The previous age range was too prescriptive and prevented more mature beef animals from qualifying for the PGI. To prevent old cattle from being included the specification has been extended to include only prime cattle (cattle which have not bred)’. Such amendment was requested by Hybu Cig Cymru — Meat Promotion Wales, pursuant to Artcle 5 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 OJ L 93, 31.3.2006. , and forwarded to the European Commission by the government of the United Kingdom together with its favourable opinion. The European Commission, after scrutinising the amendment application and following clarifications given by the Member state, accepted and published the revised single document and the reference to the product specification in the Official Journal of the European Union . The product specifications and more particularly the minimum slaughtering age required for the use of the protected geographical indications ‘Welsh Beef’ and ‘Scotch Beef’ are different because the groups making the applications have decided to set different product specifications. Laying down product specifications or seeking to amend them is the sole responsibility of the groups to be avaluated and submitted via the Member State concerned. As a consequence of the registration of the term ‘Welsh beef’ as a protected geographical indication under Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the use of this term is reserved for beef from animals with a minimum age of 24 months and fulfilling the other requirements of the product specification. Reference to the Welsh origin for meat not covered by the specification for ‘Welsh beef’ are to be evaluated under general and meat-specific labelling rules and Article 13(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
