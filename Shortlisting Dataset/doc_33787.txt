Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2011) Pakistan faces enormous security problems and has suffered itself heavily from terrorism. Since 2003 the country has lost more than 10 000 civilians and 3 700 soldiers and faces attacks almost on a daily basis. The EU recognises the extent of the terrorism problem faced by Pakistan, including the tragedies caused by the recent attacks in major cities as well as battles being fought by the Pakistan Army on the Afghan border. The EU believes that the best approach to counter-terrorism is based on a law enforcement model, not military action. The EU is cooperating with Pakistan in supporting the counter-terrorism capacity of the police in Khyber Pakhtoonkhaw (the former North-West Frontier Province (NWFP)) and Punjab provinces. In particular, this cooperation entails enhancing inter-agency cooperation and sharing of information (investigation structures, forensics, etc), strengthening criminal justice and reinforcing prevention measures (including counter-radicalisation and media support). Ultimately, a development approach is required to bring stability and prosperity to Pakistan. The EU is cooperating with Pakistan in the focal areas of education and rural development and remains committed to supporting Pakistan in building a prosperous and stable society based on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. To the EU's knowledge the Taliban are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan but not in Arab countries.
