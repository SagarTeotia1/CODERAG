Answer given by Ms Grybauskaitė on behalf of the Commission (27 March 2008) A table with a description of the funding granted from the general EU budget to some of the entities is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. The Commission's research has not always found the exact match of names mentioned by the Honourable Member. The Commission cannot exclude that certain organisations, like the ones identified in this answer as non-recipients of EU funding, mention such funding in their sources of revenue, either on their websites or in other publicity material. This is mainly due to the fact that the Commission bases its research on the information available in the ABAC Contracts database, which only contains information on contracts or grants awarded directly by the Commission. In other words, the available information does not cover funding managed by Member States' authorities under shared management nor funding under indirect centralised management, for example that managed through national agencies or through research consortia. Finally, it is also possible that the mention of EU funding contained in these organisations' materials refers to payments made before 2005.
