to Rules 51 and 83(7) of its Rules of Procedure, – having regard to the report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety ( A6‑0221/2008 ), 1. Approves conclusion of the protocol; 2. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and the Commission, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The fifth Ministerial Conference "Environment for Europe held" in Kiev, Ukraine in May 2003 adopted the Protocol on Strategic Environmental assessment to the 1991 UN/ECE Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in Transboundary Context (SEA Protocol). The Commission on behalf of the European Community signed the SEA Protocol on 21 May 2003. The 1991 UN/ECE Convention on transboundary Environmental Impact Assessment (the Espoo Convention), building on existing EIA law, established procedures for consulting Parties likely to be affected by transboundary environmental impacts of proposed projects. The Convention entered into force in 1997. The European Community signed it on 26 February 1991 and ratified in on 24 June 1997. Its main provisions are implemented by Directive 97/11. Directive 2001/42/EC, on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive), applies to a broad category of plans and programmes, and sets out detailed requirements for assessing and reporting on their environmental effects. The ability to adverse environmental effects at project level may be constrained by decisions taken in plans or policies. For this reason, it has been established that a process of assessment should be carried out these levels. This is the SEA- process. The SEA - Directive includes a provision on transboundary effects inspired by the Espoo Convention. The SEA - Protocol's objectives are to provide for a high level of protection of the environment, including health, and to ensure that these concerns are integrated into measures and instruments designed to ensure sustainable development. The European Community, in conformity with its Strategy on Sustainable Development and Better Regulation, intends to implement Article 13 of the Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment to the Espoo Convention through the impact assessment procedures set out in the Communications on Impact Assessment, which address in a balanced manner the economic, social and environmental components of sustainable development. Several aspects of the EU dimension deserve consideration. The EC and the Member States have been among the leaders in developing the concept and practice of the SEA and they should confirm their support by ratifying the Protocol on Strategic Assessment to the Espoo Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context.
