Question for written answer E-3567/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nessa Childers (S&D) (25 May 2010) Subject: Uniformity of divorce legislation Given the increasingly metropolitan nature of the EU, I have welcomed the recent enhanced cooperation on divorce, aimed at making life easier for the many thousands of couples across the EU who married in one place and are living/working in another. In many of these countries, the partners may also come from a second and third Member State. Given that enhanced cooperation has recently been used to shore up divorce laws, does the Commission have any further plans to develop these laws? Does it anticipate that any further EU Member States will sign up to increased cooperation on divorce law in the near future?
