part of regional, multi-partner structures; (f) the development of an internal market in organic food and non-food products will lead to the standardisation of their production methods, whilst naturally taking account of their particular features and traditional regional methods of production, will establish uniform controls and national bodies for the certification of organic products, and will help to remove obstacles to trade and provide fuller information to European consumers; also takes the view that the Community logo should be supplemented with information about the local and regional origin of the products; 3. Welcomes the Commission’s intention t o further harmonis e European standards for organic products and production, thus enabling proper functioning of the internal market, ending distortion of competition, and guaranteeing completely free trade in organic products through out the European Union; considers that Member States’ higher national standards should not prevent organic products from other Member States being traded freely as certified organic products in such Member States; 4. Acknowledges the major role of the Internet as a tool for the dissemination and promotion of organic farming and believes that it is extremely important that the information be circulated among the agents involved; suggests, for this reason, that a serious effort be made to transfer the technology already available; and requests that the Commission establish training measures with Community funding (over and above the provisions of Action 6 addressed to the Member States) for those farmers and producers who wish to opt for the conversion of their traditional operations into organic operations; 5.

Recalls that in the context of the 2005 budgetary procedure, Parliament specifically included the Action Plan under the budget item relating to promotional campaigns (05 08 05 01), and takes the view that an increase in this budget line could be envisaged for 2006 after an analysis of the needs of the Member States; 8. Takes the view that the Action Plan should include a recommendation that development aid and fair trade should promote the production of and trade in organic products so that the Organic Action Plan also acquires a global perspective; Public aid for organic farming (Actions 4-6) 9. Considers it essential for the actions and aid for which provision is made under the Regulation on rural development to be more clearly defined as regards organic production, with a view to promoting this production method in all the Member States; considers in this connection that the dynamic of applying the new FEADER programme for rural development in the Member States should be carefully observed; 10. Stresses the need to encourage public aid for organic farming and for industries connected to organic farming, and to promote the introduction of quality systems; 11. Takes
