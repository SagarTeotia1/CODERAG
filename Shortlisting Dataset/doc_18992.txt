Question for written answer E-004135/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (29 April 2011) Subject: Separation between the banking sector and the insurance sector In Spain, private insurance mediation (regulated by Law 26/2006, which derives from Directive 2002/92/EC) is basically divided up between brokers, agents (extensions of the insurance companies) and ‘bancassurance’ operators (companies linked or belonging to financial institutions). As a result of the world crisis of recent years, the financial institutions have committed themselves to an increasingly aggressive policy in the insurance mediation sector, so that they can start making profits again by eliminating all the other operators in the insurance sector, using the strength they enjoy as a result of their position and their de facto ‘monopoly’ on providing finance for businesses and individuals so as to sell their own insurance policies to anyone who needs access to external funding. The various techniques and strategies they are using to monopolise the insurance mediation sector may well, in many instances, infringe legislation on the protection of personal data, freedom of competition and consumers’ rights. The problem is that the activity in question, whether or not it formally constitutes concerted action by the banks and savings banks, is becoming de facto general practice throughout Spain. With respect to proper regulation of the financial sector in general, and of insurance mediation in particular, would it not be far more effective to ban financial institutions (banks, savings banks and ‘bancassurance’ operators) from operating in the insurance sector in general, and from insurance mediation in particular?
