Question for written answer E-4518/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Werner Langen (PPE) (22 June 2010) Subject: Financial losses as a result of flight bans According to media reports, airlines suffered losses of USD 2.2 billion because of cancelled flights in April 2010. One study suggests that the disruption to flights caused worldwide economic performance to fall by 5 billion. As a result, the Council called for a review of how ash concentrations are measured, the introduction of standard limit values and uniform rules for imposing flight bans. 1. What action will the Commission take to introduce standard ways of measuring and limit values? At what level should these be introduced, and what institutions should be responsible for imposing flight bans and closing the airspace in a particular location? 2. What possibilities are there for airlines to receive compensation? Could the European Disaster Fund be used as a way of compensating airlines where necessary? What would the financing possibilities from this fund be? 3. What is the current situation regarding the creation of a Single European Sky?
