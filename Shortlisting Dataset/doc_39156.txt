ORAL QUESTION H-0653/05 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou to the Commission Subject: Measures to protect children and young people from social exclusion The percentage of young people in Europe is expected to fall considerably in the coming decades. It is a general realisation that large numbers of children are living in European countries in conditions of poverty and social exclusion. Will the Commission propose measures to safeguard in law the right of disadvantaged social groups of young people to take part in the Community acquis and will it take particular measures to improve their living conditions, education and vocational development so that they do not become victims of exploitation?
