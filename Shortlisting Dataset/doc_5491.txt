with their mandate and with the responsibilities conferred upon them pursuant to their country's domestic law and to EU legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation) OJ L 364, 9.12.2004, p. 1. – to take joint action to prevent any further spread of directory companies' misleading practices and to introduce effective measures which will put directory companies out of business and enable those who run them to be punished; 13. Considers that directory companies’ practices as described are not only inconsistent with decent behaviour and with standards of fair trading, but also for the most part bear the hallmark of fraud and of other criminal acts and offences, and hence calls upon the appropriate supervisory bodies, police forces and public prosecutor's offices in the Member States – and also upon Europol and Eurojust – to carry out a detailed investigation into the organisers’ practices, possibly leading to the bringing of charges against guilty parties coming from the EU; should they come from third countries, calls upon the Commission to make every effort to conclude international agreements with the countries concerned pursuant to Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004; 14. Calls upon the Commission – with a view to outlawing directory companies’ misleading practices – to consider carefully the following measures: - that the mandatory section of an order be standardised in such a way as to ensure that it contains agreements which are in accordance with decent behaviour and which transparently define basic legal relationships (including a clear statement of price); the content of that section could be verified by the appropriate bodies within the Member States (such as the trading standards inspectorate or the authorities responsible for protecting personal data); - that form-based contracts or orders, where the weaker party to the contract or order has no possibility of altering it and can only accept or reject it, be subject to similar rules as apply to unfair commercial practices, even if the weaker party to the contract or order is not a consumer; - that form-based contracts or orders be subject to an ‘average consumer’ test similar to that which applies to unfair commercial practices, even if the weaker party to the contract or order is not a consumer; - that the principle be introduced whereby if a significant number of individuals is ‘misled’ by the text of a form-based contract or order, the burden of proof is reversed and the directory company bears the burden of proving that the text of the form-based contract or order would not mislead a 'sound financial manager'; 15. Points out to the Commission that misleading practices of this nature on the part of directory companies are targeted not only at entrepreneurs but also at natural persons (including political representatives) who are not engaged in business practices but who receive offers concerning fictitious entries in biographical publications (such as ‘Who's Who’, Personality of
