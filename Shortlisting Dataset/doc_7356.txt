Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (16 July 2010) The Commission keeps the European Parliament and the rapporteurs regularly informed on the key developments with regard to SIS II. Most of the questions posed by the Honourable Member have therefore been addressed on these occasions. 1. The Council gave a mandate to the Commission to develop the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS) II by adopting, on 6 December 2001, Council Decision 2001/886/JHA and Council Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001 on the development of SIS II. The regulation and Decision on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of 20 December 2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA of 12 June 2007. and a Regulation on use of SIS II by Member States' services responsible for vehicle registration certificates Regulation (EC) No 1986/2006 of 20 December 2006. form the legal basis for the operational phase of SIS II. The so-called ‘migration instruments’ Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 of 24 October 2008 of 8 November 2008 and Decision 2008/839/JHA of 24 October 2008. allocate responsibilities during the development phase up to entry into operation. 2. According to the legal instruments governing SIS II, the costs of setting up, operating and maintaining Central SIS II and the related Communication Infrastructure are borne by the general budget of the European Union. Up to 1 April 2010, a total of EUR 82.3 has been committed by the Commission for SIS II and total payments of EUR 51.0 million have been made. The main expenditure items were development (EUR 24.3 million), network (EUR 14.6 million) and support and quality assurance (EUR 6.7 million). Each Member State shall be responsible for setting up, operating and maintaining its national SIS II system and connecting it to a national interface. 3. The JHA Council of 4-5 June 2009 provided a new roadmap for the SIS II, which included the introduction of the two Milestone tests. A new planning for entry into operation was made dependant on the successful completion of the first Milestone test. The Milestone 1 test has now been passed, and the JHA Council of 23 April called upon the Commission to present a comprehensive global schedule and budgetary estimate to the Council at its meeting on 3-4 June 2010. These are to be confirmed as a binding global schedule and a solid and comprehensive budgetary plan valid until the entry into operation of the SIS II, preferably by the end of July 2010 and at the latest at the Council meeting on 7-8 October 2010. Following significant efforts undertaken jointly by all stakeholders, the Commission presented to the JHA Council on 3-4 June a comprehensive global schedule, which indicates the first quarter of 2013 as the date for the entry into operation of SIS II. This will be confirmed as a binding global schedule preferably by the end of July 2010 and at the latest at the Council meeting on 7-8 October 2010. 4.
