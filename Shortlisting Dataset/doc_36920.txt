or encoding errors and as regards protection of the data processed, h) the right to appeal to an independent authority and redress mechanisms in the event of infringements of passengers" rights; 3. Declares itself ready to deal under urgent procedure with an international agreement which complies with the above-mentioned principles; considers that if such an agreement were to be adopted, the Commission could legitimately declare that data would be adequately protected in the USA; 4. Calls on the Commission to submit to Parliament a new adequacy-finding decision and to ask the Council for a mandate for a strong new international agreement in compliance with the principles outlined in this resolution; 5. Pending a permanent legislative solution or the conclusion of one or more international agreements, calls upon: a) the Member States to require immediate compliance with Community legislation and their own domestic laws on privacy and draws particular attention to the obligation imposed (pursuant to Article 26(1)(a) of Directive 95/46/EC) on airlines and travel agencies to obtain passengers' consent for the transfer of data; such consent must be given freely and passengers must be informed of the options open to them for influencing the content of their PNR, of the implications of failing to give consent and of the fact that an adequate level of protection does not exist in the USA; b) the Commission to act in order to ensure that Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 is enforced and, in particular, to check that data are not transferred (in particular by means of computer reservation systems) without a passenger's consent and that the administrations of third countries have no access to those systems; 6. Calls on the Commission to block: a) the "pull" system from 1 July 2004, and from that date onwards to apply the "push" system with the 19 items suggested on 13 June 2003 by theWorking Party referred to in Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC, b) the initiatives for establishing European centralised management of the PNR data as outlined in Communication COM(2003) 826 and recently confirmed by the competent Commissioner to the parliamentary committee, as such initiatives are for the time being in breach of the proportionality and subsidiarity principles; 7. In the meantime, reserves the right to appeal to the Court of Justice should the draft decision be adopted by the Commission; reminds the Commission of the requirement for cooperation between institutions which is laid down in Article 10 of the Treaty and calls upon it not to take, during the election period, any decision such as the one with which this resolution is concerned; 8. Reserves the right to bring an action before the Court of Justice in order to seek verification of the legality of the projected international agreement and, in particular, the compatibility thereof with the protection of a fundamental right; 9. Considers it extremely important that the outcome of the negotiations should not be taken as a model for the EU's further work on the development of its own anti-crime measures, data storage and protection of confidentiality; 10. Calls upon the Commission to withdraw
