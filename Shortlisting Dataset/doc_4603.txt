8.6.2005 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION pursuant to Rule 113 of the Rules of Procedure by Josu Ortuondo Larrea on the situation of the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay Motion for a European Parliament resolution on the situation of the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay The European Parliament , – having regard to Rule 113 of its Rules of Procedure, A. whereas the spring fishing season for the Cantabrian seine fishing fleet is producing hardly any anchovy, with a catch of 160 tonnes up to 12 May; whereas this situation has never before been encountered in this fishing ground, as by the middle of May 40% of the annual catch should normally have been landed; whereas, however, the catches are almost non-existent; whereas there is no precedent for this in the whole history of this fishing area, B. whereas the scientific biomass evaluation campaign carried out in May 2005 showed a record low figure for anchovy roe, equivalent to half of that found in 2004, C. whereas the scientifically estimated spawning-stock biomass is only 50% of the minimum biomass set by ICES, confirming the crisis in the anchovy population, and in the absence of information on the dynamics of the resource and its capacity for recovery, with the high probability that it will cause the collapse of the fishing ground, 1. Considers that, in this context and in accordance with the precautionary principle, it is reasonable to request the closing of commercial fisheries in all affected Member States until such time as recovery of this resource has been proven in a new scientific opinion.
