Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (26 June 2007) Under the Turkish legislation, the Presidency of Religious Affairs established under the Prime Ministry oversees matters related to belief, worship and ethics in Islam, including the administration of places of worship. The legislation also provides that the Presidency does not represent any sect or school of Islam and that it is expected to provide opinions on the history of the Muslim religious experience. According to the Turkish authorities, the Presidency is not a religious organisation, does not have a religious hierarchy, and its civil servants do not represent a spiritual authority. The latter operate under the civil service legislation and are expected to express opinions on religious issues without making any discrimination. The Commission has been and will continue to follow closely the tragic events in Malatya of 18 April 2007. It continues to monitor developments. The Commission also took note of the statements of the Head of State, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Speaker of Parliament and other politicians condemning the killings. It is now expecting the police to carry out a full investigation and the judiciary, a fair trial. The Commission is looking forward to a conscious and sustained effort to build an atmosphere of tolerance in the country that will no longer be conducive to such acts. The Government, political parties and civil society should each assume their responsibilities and play their role. The continuation and strengthening of accession negotiations can act as a catalyst of such a process.
