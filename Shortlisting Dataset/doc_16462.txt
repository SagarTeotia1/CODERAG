Question for written answer E-001347/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President/High Representative) Rule 117 Charalampos Angourakis (GUE/NGL) (6 February 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Immediate release of Cuban prisoners in the USA As is well known, the 5 Cuban nationals Gerardo Hernandez, Rene Gonzales, Antonio Guerrero, Ramon Labanino and Fernando Gonzales have been imprisoned, for 13 years, in various US prisons for exposing the aggressive plans of criminal organisations in Miami against Cuba and its people. One of these prisoners, Rene Gonzales, has recently been released but is required to remain in the US for three more years under the condition of ‘supervised release’. The other four continue to serve unfair and crushing prison sentences. The illegal judicial proceedings, the wretched prison conditions and the prohibition of visits from relatives has sparked frequent mass protests by large national and international workers unions, cultural figures, Nobel prize winners, Members of Parliament and the European Parliament and thousands of people all over the world. The appeal for an end to this unfair situation, for them to be released and to return immediately to Cuba, is universal. What is the position of the VP/HR regarding the immediate release and return of the above Cuban fighters to their country?
