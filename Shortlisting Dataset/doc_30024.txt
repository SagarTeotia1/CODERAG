Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (19 January 2009) The Commission is following an integrated approach for the European road safety policy, which means that its initiatives address the three main topics: vehicle, human factor and infrastructure. The most recent European legislation on infrastructure is Directive 2008/96/EC Directive 2008/96/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on road infrastructure safety management, OJ L 319, 29.11.2008. . Among other obligations, Member States will have to implement regular road safety inspections on the existing network, identify the potentially dangerous stretches and implement remedies. The scope of the directve is limited to trans-European road network but the Member States are free to apply it to the rest of their road network. Concerning roads not covered by the above directive, the Member States remain competent to regulate on the safety of construction works in their territory. In doing so they have to respect the provisions of the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC OJ L 40, 11.2.1989. ) and the Public Procurement Directives (2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC) OJ L 134, 30.4.2004. and in the technical specifications for their contacts these authorities must refer to European standards for construction products.
