Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (4 January 2012) The Common Strategic Framework (CSF) will translate the objectives and targets of the Union priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth into key actions for the European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Social Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (the ‘CSF Funds’). The proposed CSF will constitute an important reference document for Member States in the preparation of Partnership Contracts and programmes and it will provide the framework for their assessment by the Commission, thus bringing greater consistency and certainty to the negotiation process. The Commission is aware that the adoption procedures need careful consideration. However, the Commission's view is that the proposed common provisions regulation for the CSF Funds lays down the core obligations with the essential elements of the CSF within the strategic programming process. In particular, Article 11 of the common provisions regulation gives concrete shape to the fundamental principles of a Union policy framework in line with the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU (notably, Case C‑240/90, Germany v Commission (1992) ECR I‑5383 at paragraphs 36-37). The CSF itself supplements those essential elements, acting as a reference document for Member States in the programming process, and can therefore be a Commission delegated act in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.
