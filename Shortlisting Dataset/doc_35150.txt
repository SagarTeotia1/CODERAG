Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (22 October 2008) Areas of ‘Special Scenic Landscapes (SSL)’ are a national designation and therefore a matter for the relevant competent authorities in the Member State to decide on. SSLs do not fall under the scope of protection of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 288, 6.11.2007. , unless these areas are also specifically included in the Natura 2000 network of protected areas. In such cases the protection safeguards, defined in Article 6 of the Habitats Directive would apply. The Commission would encourage Member States and local planning authorities to incorporate information on such Natura 2000 sites into their development plans and other relevant planning documentation.
