Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2011) 1. The Commission proposal for a regulation on Union guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network COM(2011) 650 final. (TEN‑T guidelines) will reduce fragmentation by introducing a stronger network approach, based on two layers: the comprehensive and the core network. Both encompass all transport modes. Through implementation tools like multi-modal corridors, emphasis is put on efficient multi-modal transport. The Commission proposal for establishing a Connecting Europe Facility COM(2011) 665 final. does however not foresee a fixed distribution of financial support between the different transport modes. 2. While the TEN‑T guidelines concern first of all infrastructure, the proposal aims to take into account problems arising from different operating rules between Member States. Reinforced coordination in the corridor platforms will allow to identify and tackle such obstacles. 3. The proposal for the TEN‑T guidelines foresees explicitly the participation of stakeholders in the corridor platforms (see Article 52(2)). As regards their precise role in the decision making process, enough flexibility in the implementation of the corridors has to be foreseen, as situations may differ substantially between different corridors. A one size fits all approach seems in that respect not appropriate.
