Question for written answer E-001319/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) (14 February 2012) Subject: Safeguarding the sustainability and adequacy of Greek Public Power Corporation (DEI) social security provisions In our written question of 3 February 2012 on ‘Safeguarding the social security entitlements of employees at the Greek Public Power Corporation (DEI)’ we described the background to DEI social security arrangements. From 1966 to 1999, the DEI was able to meet its needs through social security contributions without the need for interest-bearing loans or electricity surcharges. The European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition, in a letter signed by Mr Mario Monti, explicitly states that the DEI's production profits alone amounted to EUR 4.415 million since, for a certain period, it was not obliged to pay contributions to the pension fund of its employees {C(2002) 3729fin}. Instead, the DEI undertook to cover all social security expenditure for them. This is a classic capital-funded system, similar to the EDF's social security arrangements. At the same time, the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled that the DEI SA pension scheme is an occupational pension scheme, the decisive criterion for its classification as ‘occupational’ being the existence of an employment relationship, a condition which has not changed (Judgment 17.4.1997 C 147/95 and Opinion of Advocate General F.G. Jakobs 16.1.1997). After the DEI was made a Public Limited Company (SA) under the appropriate legislation (Article 34 — Law 277./99), the Greek Government agreed to fund its social insurance scheme in return for retaining control of its assets. Since 2010, however, the amount earmarked for the scheme by the Greek Government has been reduced by over 30 %, thereby infringing the relevant national legislation. In the light of this: 1. What view does the Commission take of this action by the Greek Government? Is it compatible with European legislation and, if not, does it intend to call on Greece to comply with it? 2. Have any similar cases arisen in other Member States and how were they resolved?
