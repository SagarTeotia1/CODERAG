to State aid to the industry under its competition policy, which should take into account the specific nature of the sector, on the other hand, with the aim both of improving the European audiovisual industry’s competitiveness and of safeguarding cultural diversity; 3. Calls on the Commission, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, in implementing the i2i initiative, which was launched following the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, to devote particular attention to: (a) the financing of transnational distribution structures for European films, (b) the infrastructure requirements of smaller, independent cinemas which show many European films, (c) the structural needs of European SMEs which produce independent films and are generally undercapitalised, (d) structural needs of European cinema festivals whose programming is essentially European; 4. Calls on the Commission, in implementing MEDIA Plus, to aim for administrative and financial management systems which are efficient and as appropriate as possible to the patterns and constraints that invariably characterise the industry; 5. Draws attention to the major importance of the Europa Cinemas network of cinemas, and the interesting work that is being done by the European Coordination of Film Festivals, which are supported by the MEDIA programme, for the distribution respectively promotion of European films and considers that these networks should be further expanded; 6. Draws the attention of the Commission, the Council, the Member States, the applicant countries and the regions to the pressing need to create and foster European film stars of international standing and notes in particular the importance of the ‘Shooting Stars’ initiative of the organisation European Film Promotion, supported by MEDIA, which very much deserves to be expanded; 7. Calls on the Commission, when revising the directive on Television Without Frontiers as a whole, to draw up provisions which must take into account, in addition to issues strictly connected with radio and television broadcasting, regulation of the new broadcasting media and to investigate inter alia the desirability and feasibility of: (a) introducing a framework for television broadcasters to devote a minimum proportion of their transmission time to promoting European films, (b) introducing a framework for a minimum transmission of non-national, European works, (c) introducing a framework for television broadcasters to invest a share of their annual turnover in the European film industry (either through global contributions to national/regional film funds or through individual coproductions and cofinancing), an approach which is being applied successfully in certain Member States; 8. Recognises the major contribution of some European broadcasters to the cultural and economic development of the European cinema; 9. Calls on the Commission, within the 6 th Framework Programme of Research and Technological Development, to devote attention to research relating to digital film distribution and projection techniques (e-Cinema); 10. Welcomes initiatives such as the setting-up of the European Digital Cinema Forum and experimental projects such as the Cyber Cinema in Babelsberg, and calls on the Commission and the Council to remain alert to developments in the field of e-cinema; 11. Recommends in particular that efforts be made in Europe to encourage use of new technologies for new forms of distribution
