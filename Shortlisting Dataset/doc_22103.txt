Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) Since 2005 ‘bull bars’ (referred to as Frontal Protection Systems) have been subject to the requirements of EC Directive 2005/66/EC Directive 2005/66/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 relating to the use of frontal protection systems on motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC, OJ L 309, 25.11.2005. . This directive is the result of a request from both Council and Parliament that such systems should be subject to legislative control and follows examination of a proposed voluntary agreement from industry as one measure to provide improved protection for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. The legislation allows the use of such items on the basis that they have been tested and shown to be of such quality that they will not provide any increase in the risk of injury to a pedestrian over and above that expected of the vehicle to which they are attached. The legislation allows the fitting of these systems on older vehicles when they are proven to comply with specified tests designed to reduce injury. The recent proposal on the protection of pedestrians from the Commission Proposal for a Regulation of Parliament and of the Council on the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, COM(2007)560 final. , adopted by Parliament in first reading on the 18 June 2008, incorporates the requirements of the existing legislation on frontal protection systems and update it to ensure equivalence between the injury risk associated with these systems and that of the vehicles on which they are mounted.
