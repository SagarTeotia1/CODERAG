ORAL QUESTION H-1113/05 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Baroness Sarah Ludford to the Council Subject: Framework decision on racism and xenophobia Will the Austrian Presidency renew efforts to get agreement in the Council on a framework decision to combat racism and xenophobia proposed by the Commission in 2001 and strongly backed by the Parliament? Given the disturbing picture given in reports from the EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia based in Vienna of the extent of and failure to tackle racist crime in Europe, how can it be justified for the Council not to prioritise this legislation for a pan-European approach to outlaw criminal behaviour motivated by racial hatred?
