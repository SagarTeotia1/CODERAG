ORAL QUESTION H-0019/08 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Carl Schlyter to the Commission Subject: Use of glutaraldehyde in the Baltic Sea The company which is to build a pipeline through the Baltic Sea intends to pump out billions of litres of polluted water at Gotska Sandön, one of the finest nature reserves in Sweden. The chemical which the company intends to use to treat the water is glutaraldehyde, which is classed as R50, i.e. highly toxic to aquatic organisms. There is a risk that large areas of the Baltic will be affected. The Swedish Chemicals Agency, the body usually responsible in such cases, would have rejected this application under normal circumstances. The matter will, however, be decided by the government. Is the Swedish Government under any obligation to obtain the views of the other countries around the Baltic? Would authorisation be consistent with EU legislation and, if so, on what conditions?
