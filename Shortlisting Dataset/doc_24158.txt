Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (18 August 2011) The issue of religious freedom in general and the situation of the Christian minority in particular have been raised consistently by the EU with the Uzbek authorities in the course of its political dialogue with the country, notably in the annual Human Rights Dialogue. In the recent Human Rights Dialogue on 24 June 2011 the EU has urged Uzbek authorities to ensure respect for the rights of religious believers and to ensure that the latter are able to carry out their peaceful activities. In particular, the EU has encouraged Uzbekistan to reform the Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations in line with international standards. The Uzbek side informed that the possibility of amendments to the Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations was being considering at expert level. Uzbekistan confirmed however that proselytism was prohibited by national legislation. The EU will continue to raise the situation with regard to freedom of religion in the bilateral contacts with Uzbekistan and to call upon Uzbekistan to comply with its international human rights obligations. The EU Strategy on developing a new partnership with Central Asia, adopted by the EU Heads of State in 2007, reflects the commitment of the EU for enhanced long term engagement and cooperation with the region. In this framework, the EU and the Central Asia states have agreed to put human rights, rule of law, good governance and democratization as one of the key elements of the strategy. EU relations with Uzbekistan have to be put in this context, where encouragement to take positive steps in the field of human rights are at the basis of the dialogue and cooperation, as reflected also in the Council Conclusions on Uzbekistan of 25 October 2010.
