Question for written answer E-5782/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Philippe Juvin (PPE) (22 July 2010) Subject: Liver disease in the next Framework Programme for Research The EU’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7), which covers the period 2007‑13, dedicates a budget of EUR 6.1 billion to health. In the field of public health, FP7 addresses specific diseases within its streams of actions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, etc. Liver disease, however, is not currently mentioned in the framework programme despite statistics demonstrating that liver disease constitutes the fifth most common cause of death in Europe. In 2006, for example, the mortality rate for chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis and fatty liver disease, was 13.8 per every 100 000 EU‑27 inhabitants, greater therefore than the mortality rate for diabetes http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-CD-09-001/EN/KS-CD-09-001-EN.PDF . Moreover, in western Europe the United Kingdom and Finland report nearly twofold increases in death rates from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in the last 10 years http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/98391/E93348.pdf . Whilst other common causes of mortality, such as CVD and certain types of cancer, are declining in most Member States, liver disease is increasing at an alarming rate in some countries. According to the WHO, this rising trend is associated with new patterns of drinking http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/alcstrategyaftereb.pdf . Nevertheless, the EU continues to ignore the need to better understand liver disease and its risk factors. With this in mind, will the Commission ensure that the next EU Framework Programme for Research (FP8) in the field of public health addresses liver disease alongside other major health threats?
