Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (21 December 2007) Each individual Member State decides whether or not to use nuclear energy. The present acquis communautaire states that the responsibility for the safe design, location, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants remains incumbent on the State having jurisdiction over it. The same applies to countries in the pre-accession and accession stage. The role of the Commission is to ensure that whenever nuclear energy is used, the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation are met. The EU is also active in ensuring that such high standards are observed internationally, in the context of increased cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Two years ago, the Commission proposed a framework with common rules in the field of nuclear safety. The Council did not however adopt this proposed framework. Recently, the Commission created a High Level Group of Nuclear Safety and Waste Management to launch a proper debate on nuclear energy and discuss possible common safety standards which could be adopted at EU level. In addition, the newly created Nuclear Forum had its first meeting in Bratislava on 26‑27 November 2007 and the second meeting will take place 22‑23 May 2008 in Prague.
