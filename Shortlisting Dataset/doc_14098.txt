WRITTEN QUESTION E-2973/10 by Alain Cadec (PPE) to the Commission (3 May 2010) Subject: Fishing of undulate ray Council Regulation (EU) No 23/2010 OJ L 21, 26.1.2010, p. 1. of 14 January 2010 lays down strict conservation measures for certain species of ray and prohibits the fishing of, among others, the undulate ray ( Raja undulata ), the white skate ( Rostroraja alba ), the common skate ( Dipturus batis ) and the Norwegian skate ( Raja nidarosiensis ). This total ban on fishing seems disproportionate given the existing scientific advice and the catches of these species by French professionals. In Brittany, undulate ray can comprise up to 35 % of trawlers’ catches. The ban is not, perhaps, having the intended effect in terms of enhancing the stock given that the survival rate of by-catches thrown back into the water is uncertain to say the least. There is currently little available research on the subject. Professionals are particularly affected, economically speaking, by this ban. On what date does the Commission plan to review the availability of stocks with a view to lifting this ban and allowing fishing to recommence? Is scientific research being carried out to assess stocks in the areas concerned?
