WRITTEN QUESTION E-0022/10 by Charalampos Angourakis (GUE/NGL) to the Council (19 January 2010) Subject: Opposition to the Polish authorities' anti-communist campaign Communist symbols are now banned by law in Poland and, by virtue of an amendment to the penal code signed by President Lech Kaczyński, will be considered illegal. This development is part of an ongoing anti-communist campaign which equates communism with fascism, attempts to falsify history and prohibits anything reminiscent of the construction of socialism and the achievements of the people. It is a provocative act aimed at prosecuting anyone who voices opposition and fights for a better tomorrow. The penalty is a fine or up to two years in prison. Similar measures were also taken by the Nazis during the Second World War throughout Europe and the fascist dictatorships in Greece, Spain and Portugal. These reactionary measures violate the fundamental democratic freedoms of the people and are an affront to the sacrifices and the struggles of millions of communists and workers who fell in the fight to overcome fascism and Nazism. In similar vein is the proposal by the Czech senator, Jaromír Štětina, to prohibit the Communist Party of Bohemia-Moravia (Czech Republic) following the recent, unacceptable ban on the Union of Communist Youth, KSM. Does the Council condemn these reactionary decisions by the Polish Government as well as the persecution of communists, and workers in general, in the Czech Republic?
