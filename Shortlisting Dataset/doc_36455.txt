policies remain necessary, particularly as a means of achieving a high level of employment, which in turn will serve to boost consumption; emphasises, finally, that the development of high-quality jobs will lead to improved labour productivity in Europe; 16. Regards investment in social services, and in childcare in particular, as fundamental to achieving genuine equality between men and women and to increasing the employment rate among women; reiterates, in this context, the need to achieve the objective of a 60% employment rate for women by 2010, as laid down in the Lisbon Strategy; 17. Emphasises the importance of a proposal for a Council decision declaring 2006 European year against violence against women; 18. Points out that any economic liberalisation policy must be consistent with the principles and objectives of the Social Agenda; emphasises, further, that the involvement of workers’ and consumers’ representatives in liberalisation procedures must be guaranteed; 19. Calls on the Commission to strengthen and monitor more closely its policies in the field of employment and social affairs; urges the Commission to continue to develop social dialogue, to make progress with the European employment strategy and to use a strengthened open coordination method to deal with policy on social exclusion and social protection in an enlarged Union; 20. Reaffirms that the EU’s cohesion policy is more necessary than ever at a time when the Union is seeking a commitment to European integration through support for the Constitution; takes the view that the Union must reduce the disparities between its regions which have widened following the enlargement and promote measures that enable it to achieve the objectives laid down in Lisbon and Göteborg; 21. Takes the view, therefore, that approval of the new financial perspective for the period 2007-2013, on the basis of the Commission proposal and during the current Presidency, will play a vital role in securing adoption of the cohesion policy regulations which will make for efficient programming in 2006; emphasises that the Structural and Cohesion Funds are the key public instruments for sustainable development; 22. Calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for a restricted revision of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules with a view to eliminating all the obstacles to decision-making and the smooth implementation of the budget; looks to the Commission to consult all the other institutions concerned by the Financial Regulation in order to take account of their experiences, which are sometimes substantially at odds with the Commission’s viewpoint; 23. Reiterates, in keeping with the spirit of the Lisbon and Göteborg process, that the EU needs a balanced approach to economic, social and environmental policies; emphasises that environmental policy can further competitiveness and must be compatible with growth and employment, but must not and need not take second place to economic objectives; calls, therefore, for the finalisation of an ambitious environmental legislative programme aimed at proper implementation of the environmental thematic strategies and the continuation of a broad-based policy, in particular in the fields of chemicals, food safety, energy efficiency, renewable energies, air and water quality, waste and the development of non-polluting technologies;
