The Communities budget is not ‘allocated’ to Member States, but paid either as advances on programmes or following the receipt of payment claims. In 2004, all Structural Fund payments corresponded to advances on programmes.Cohesion Fund payments were payments on projects which were first presented as ISPA projects.
