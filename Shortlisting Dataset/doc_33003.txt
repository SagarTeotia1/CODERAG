Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (26 March 2007) The Commission at this stage does not plan the presentation of a proposal for a sixth Motor Insurance Directive. The issue of inclusion of legal expenses in the scope of third party motor liability insurance is covered in the framework of a Commission report to the Parliament and the Council on certain issues relating to motor insurance. This report, reflecting the comments received within the consultation with the Member States, the insurance industry and the public, is foreseen for adoption by the Commission by mid‑April 2007.
