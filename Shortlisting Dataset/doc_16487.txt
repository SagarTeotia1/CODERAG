and why does it not propose to take up the reference in the Recommendation to the possibility of it submitting a proposal for a directive on environmental inspections? 2. Why has it opted instead for a piecemeal approach, and proposes to attach environmental inspection requirements to existing directives individually – a process that is bound to take time? 3. Why is it not prepared to use a directive to define terms such as 'inspection' and 'audit', which it admits are 'interpreted in different ways by Member States' when set out in a Recommendation? 4. Why it is not prepared to transform IMPEL into an effective EU environmental inspection force with the right to demand the cooperation of Member State authorities, since ultimately it is only through the creation of such a force that the Commission will free itself from reliance on those it is trying to control?

The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy calls for a direct financial commitment to ensure that 12 demonstration projects testing the permanent underground storage of CO2 are constructed by 2015. "The time delay between the potential support from emissions trading from 2013, and the necessary planning and construction phase of demonstration facilities, can be overcome by making financial resources available." Support for financing via EU Emission Trading System from 2013 Funding for the new carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) could be supplemented by providing allowances to operators of CCS technology from the EU's Emission Trading System, the report says. "Incentives for CCS technology production should be increased, by allocating, within the EU ETS, allowances for anticipated CCS technology production with an increase of at least 25 % from 2013." Similarly, it supports the proposal made by the Environment Committee to award up to 500 million trading allowances to large-scale commercial demonstration projects in the EU. Additional funding from the Seventh Research Framework Programme MEPs propose to use the EUR 500 million of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) which was held back until the mid-term review of the Seventh Research Framework Programme. According to the rapporteur, this amount could be supplemented with other funds in cooperation with the European
