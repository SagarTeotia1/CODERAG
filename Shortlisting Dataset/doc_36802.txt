WRITTEN QUESTION E-0745/08 by Saïd El Khadraoui (PSE) to the Commission (15 February 2008) Subject: People with disabilities on the labour market People with disabilities encounter difficulties in finding jobs. The Disability and Employment Consultative Body for Users (Gebruikersoverleg Handicap en Arbeid) has calculated that 15 % of unemployed people in the Flanders region have disabilities, as against 10 % in 2000. Is this a general trend throughout the EU? Does the Commission have any statistics? What initiatives is the Commission planning in order to improve access to employment for people with disabilities?
