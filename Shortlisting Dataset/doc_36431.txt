Question for written answer P-003129/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antigoni Papadopoulou (S&D) (29 March 2011) Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in Turkey Following the recent disaster in Japan, and notwithstanding the crisis at Japan’s Fukushima plant, which has caused European nations to rethink plans for nuclear reactors, Turkey has made it clear that it is not planning to suspend its atomic power programme. On the contrary, it is ready to kick-start the construction of its first plant in the town of Akkuyu, in the southern province of Mersin. As is well known, the Akkuyu plant is located at a site just 25 km from an active earthquake fault line. Nevertheless, the Turkish Government insists that the facility will be safe. In this connection: 1. Is the Commission aware of these recent developments, and of Turkey’s unwillingness to put off its plans for a nuclear power plant? 2. Does it intend to press Turkey, as an accession country, to abandon its plans, which may prove very problematic for the whole region? 3. Does it intend to monitor Turkey’s nuclear programme closely, given the country’s candidate status?
