Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (20 February 2012) The Spanish Government has so far undertaken important measures to strengthen the capital base of banks. It can obviously not be ruled out that further measures may be necessary, depending, for example, on macroeconomic and financial market developments. As the economic outlook in the EU has deteriorated and market pressures have intensified, exceptional measures have had to be considered to restore stability and confidence. Based on the agreement of the European Council of 26 October 2011, the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a formal recommendation requiring systematically important banks to build up exceptional and temporary capital buffers to reach a Core Tier 1 capital ratio of 9 % after accounting for sovereign debt holdings at market prices. According to EBA, five Spanish banks need additional capital of about EUR 26.2 billion. One of those banks, accounting for more than half of those capital needs (EUR 15.3 billion), has already raised the necessary capital six months ahead of the June deadline. Other banks are expected to comply with the new capital requirements without needing public support. The Bank of Spain received the compliance plans of those banks by 20 January 2012 and will evaluate if any public support may be required.
