2003 on genetically modified food and feed (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 268, 18.10.2003. (and therefore the precautionary principle laid down in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002) applies and justifies the emergency measures. All the findings of the unauthorised GM rice Bt63 reported in the RASFF are for products imported from China. The Commission is not aware of cases of contamination with Bt63 in other countries. The Community controls in place are targeting both consignments originating in and dispatched from China thus enabling the identification of contaminated products imported from China by any third country and then dispatched to the EU.
