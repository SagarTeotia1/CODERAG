WRITTEN QUESTION E-4151/08 by Paul van Buitenen (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (21 July 2008) Subject: Administrative inefficiencies by the JRC In a letter to Commissioner Potočnik of 4 March of this year, the chair of a union representing the staff of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) confirmed that the information which served as the basis for my parliamentary questions concerning administrative inefficiencies in the JRC (E‑0871/08, E‑0872/08 and E‑1021/08) was completely correct and even fell short of reflecting the true seriousness of the situation. Commissioner Potočnik was informed of the following in particular: — the pressure under which staff who challenged the irregularities were placed; — the fact that several of the staff were even forced to leave the JRC; — that the irregularities referred to in my parliamentary questions concerning the award of a contract worth EUR 200 000 in connection with decommissioning were not only completely true but also constituted fraud against the social security system of a Member State; — that other study contracts with no added value had been awarded to the same company; — that all the problems referred to in my questions were in themselves more serious than the issues which caused the fall of the Santer Commission, and that there were matters even more serious than these which had not been made public. In view of the seriousness of the above details, which were brought to the attention of Mr Potočnik, will the Commission: 1. state whether, given the collective responsibility of the Commission, they were brought to the attention of the other commissioners by Commissioner Potočnik; 2. explain the steps taken to clarify completely the details brought to the attention of Commissioner Potočnik; 3. specify the measures adopted in order to put to an end these inefficiencies, which cannot now be denied, and to continue the operation of the JRC in accordance with the rules and procedures in force?
