Answer given by Mr Bolkestein on behalf of the Commission (23 October 2003) The Honourable Member is most likely referring to Directive 2002/92/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 9 December 2002 on insurance mediation OJ L 9, 15.1.2003 . . This Directive will establish a legal regime, which ensures a high level of professionalism for insurance intermediaries and reinforces the information requirements to be provided to customers. Customers will therefore be better protected. The Directive requires that any insurance intermediary shall be registered with a competent authority in his home Member State, provided that he meets strict professional requirements in relation to his professional competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and, where the insurance intermediary manages funds of his clients, appropriate financial capacity. The Directive requires that an insurance intermediary shall hold professional indemnity insurance covering the whole territory of the Community or some other comparable guarantee against liability arising from professional negligence, for at least EUR 1 million applying to each claim and in aggregate EUR 1,5 million per year for all claims. This insurance cover or financial guarantee is not required when an insurance undertaking, a reinsurance undertaking or another undertaking on whose behalf the insurance or reinsurance intermediary is acting, takes the full responsibility for the intermediary's actions (in accordance with Article 4 (3) of the Directive). Once the insurance or reinsurance intermediary has been registered in his home Member State he may conduct business in the entire Community under the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services. The Directive shall be applied by Member States as of 15 January 2005.
