Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (4 August 2005) The Honourable Member's detailed comments about the increases of quantities agreed with China in the memorandum of understanding (MoU) of 10 June 2005 are based on a different basis on which the calculation of the increases was actually made. In fact, the agreed yearly increases of between 8 % and 12.5 % apply to those imports determined in accordance with paragraph 242 of the Working Party Report on China's World Trade Organisation Accession to WTO, incorporated into Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on common rules for imports of certain textiles products from third countries as amended OJ L 275, 8.11.1993 . Regulation as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 930/2005, OJ L 162, 23.6.2005. . If the EU had applied such a safeguard clause for 10 products covered by the MoU, China would have been entitled to export to the EU, for the remainder of the year, the quantities imported from China during the preceding first 12 months of the preceding 14 months period prior to the formal request for consultations with China increased by a growth rate of 7.5 % and applied on a ‘pro-rata’ basis for the rest of the year. In the deal reached with China, the quantities that China can export are the same as would result from the application of the safeguard clause, except that, instead of a 7.5 % increase, it was agreed to provide increases of between 8 % and 12.5 %. As regards 2006 and 2007, early in each of these years, in the case the EU had applied strictly the safeguard clause, each and every safeguard action would have had to be ‘reapplied’ every year for each and every product in question with the application of the same formula providing for increases in quantities. The increases agreed with China for these two years, as compared to the estimated imports in 2005, are between 10 % and 12.5 %, instead of the 7.5 % established in the textile safeguard clause. The increases of between 49 % and 318 % mentioned by the Honourable Member, therefore, refer to the estimated increases in total imports in 2005 as compared to 2004. All in all, taking into account that frequent recourse to safeguards would lead to an almost permanent negotiation and ensuing crisis in our overall relations with China, the Commission considers that the outcome of the negotiations covering 10 product categories under the terms of the understanding is by far preferable in all respects to such a scenario and, furthermore, it gives a degree of clarity and predictability to operators including the EU industry, which would otherwise not have existed. The necessary implementing regulation reflecting the MoU was published on 9 July 2005 OJ L 177, 9.7.2005 . . Exports from China made as from 11 June 2005 will be set off against the ceilings applicable from that date and until the end of the year. China will issue export licenses for shipments as from
