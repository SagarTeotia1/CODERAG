Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) The port of Tazacorte received EUR 8.3 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the Canary Islands programme for the period 2000‑2006. Due to difficult weather conditions, the port was not immediately operational after the completion of the works. As a consequence, it was decided to build an additional dam in order to protect the port and expand the commercial area. These new works are intended to be co-financed by the ERDF under the current period (2007‑2013). The Spanish authorities have submitted a major project application for the additional dam which was declared admissible in November 2010. However, the processing of the application was interrupted due to issues relating to an ongoing judicial procedure concerning a possible breach of environmental legislation. The Commission will ensure appropriate follow up before it takes its final decision on the major project application.
