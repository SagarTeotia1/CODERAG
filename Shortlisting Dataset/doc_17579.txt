WRITTEN QUESTION E-5367/06 by Richard Seeber (PPE‑DE) to the Council (7 December 2006) Subject: Endangering of tuna stocks as a result of overfishing Although the main market for tuna is in Japan, some half of the total worldwide tuna catch is caught by French, Italian and Spanish boats. The EU fishing fleet is currently allocated 57 % of catch quotas and 60 % of fish farm production of bluefin tuna. Furthermore, over the past 10 years the EU has supported fishing by, for example, subsidising the expansion of the French fishing fleet. In this context, the EU is being criticised by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). A representative of the Commission with responsibility for the EU's common fisheries policy has conceded, during a hearing on 12 September 2006, that restructuring of the industry is inevitable. What can be done to address the problem of massive overfishing of tuna stocks effectively and without delay? How can the overcapacity of fishing fleets be reduced and catch quotas cut to such an extent as to enable regeneration of stocks? What can be done to effectively combat illegal fishing? How can a balance be achieved between economic interests and protection against overfishing? Could a complete ban on fishing in important spawning areas for this species be cushioned financially through aid for fishing fleets? Are there systems for protecting against overfishing which have already been implemented for other species of fish and which have proved effective and could serve as an example?
