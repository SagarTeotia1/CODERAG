11% of the world’s population (742 million), but only 0.6% of the world’s GDP; 19. Considers that it is crucial to take into account the right to development of the citizens of poor countries, and not merely the interests of those countries’ regimes, and that poor countries must decide and lead their own development strategies and economic policies; considers that the right to industrialisation is a right of development and considers therefore that every country, and especially developing countries in which industrial development is at an early stage, has the right to regulate its industry in order to act against social or environmental dumping; 20. Takes note of recent studies by UNCTAD and other institutions that show that the extensive trade liberalisation in LDCs has not been sufficiently translated into sustained and substantial poverty reduction and has contributed to a decline in the terms of trade of developing countries, in particular of African countries; warns against the catastrophic consequences of totally eliminating customs revenue for these countries through the overhasty and forced opening of the market and stresses the right of these countries to determine themselves the speed at which they open their markets in all sectors; 21. Considers that during the WTO 6th Ministerial Conference, some progress was made with regard to Special Products and Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) and Special and Differential Treatment (SDT), taking into account the concerns of developing countries about the impact of trade liberalisation and reciprocity, but emphasises that much still remains to be done; stresses that SDT must be fully reflected in the negotiations on modalities for tariff reductions in trade in agricultural and industrial goods, in order to allow poorer developing countries sufficient time to consolidate their industrialisation efforts; 22. Calls on the governments of developing countries to formulate and implement national development strategies that integrate trade within them which effectively supports poverty reduction; notes that these efforts must be supported by international development partners, through financial and technical assistance, to build both public and private trade capacities; 23. Calls on LDCs to promote a progressive economic transition in which sustained economic growth is increasingly founded upon domestic resource mobilization, the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the tapping of financial markets, and to ensure that imports are increasingly paid for by exports rather than covered by aid flows; notes that this is most likely to be achieved if international assistance, debt relief, trade preferences and measures to facilitate FDI and technology transfer all work together to promote development and poverty reduction; 24. Calls on the governments of developing countries, and agriculture-exporting LDCs in particular, to counter the increasing population pressure on land and environmental impoverishment, where farm sizes and yields are too low to support households, through the development of employment-intensive non-agricultural tradables and technological change in subsistence-oriented activities; notes that this could be combined with countering the problem of "enclave growth" through the development of trade-related infrastructure, such as internal transport and communications, increased domestic market integration and the development of new exports, including manufactured goods and tourism; 25.
