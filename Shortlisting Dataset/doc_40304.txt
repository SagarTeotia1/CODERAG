Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (21 September 2006) The European Community and Turkey established a Customs Union through Decision No 1/95 of the EC‑Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 on implementing the final phase of the Customs Union, which entered into force on 31 December 1995 OJ L 35, 13.2.1996. . The fact that a product produced or in free circulation in the Community does not correspond to the standards of the Turkish food legislation is not in itself a sufficient reason to prohibit its import. Indeed, Article 5 of Decision 1/95 prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect. Article 7 of the same Decision foresees that both parties may establish prohibitions or restrictions on imports for certain reasons, one of which is protection of public health. Turkey invoked this reason as basis for the prohibition to which the Honourable Member refers. Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1/95 are identical in substance to Articles 28 and 30 of the EC Treaty, and must thus, in accordance with Article 66 of Decision 1/95 OJ L 1, 1.1.1995. , be interpreted in conformity with the relevant decisions of the Court of Justice on Articles 28 and 30 EC. As a consequence, such a ban would only be justified, if it would be supported by sufficient scientific evidence relating to the risk to human health. So far, despite repeated requests from the Commission, Turkey has not provided such scientific evidence. The Commission continues to raise this matter with Turkey in all the relevant bilateral fora with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution.
