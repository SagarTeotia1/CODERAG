Question for written answer E-009182/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (13 October 2011) Subject: Legal control over the activities of rating agencies A well-known rating agency, which has been accused by 13 municipalities in New South Wales of misleading them in connection with the agency's ratings of securitised debt obligations, is being tried in the first real attempt at bringing the activities of such agencies under legal control. The accusation refers the loss of large sums of money by the municipalities during the global economic crisis — a loss attributable to the consulting services of that agency. — Has the Commission investigated any damage to the interests of Member States caused by the ratings of such agencies, or received complaints about such damage? Is it investigating any such complaints? — Does it intend to take the same kind of legal action against rating agencies if it finds evidence of misleading ratings? — Will it support or encourage such initiatives by institutions, municipalities or states that choose to resolve in court issues such as those raised by these Australian municipalities?
