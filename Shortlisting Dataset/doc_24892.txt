Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (26 August 2005) The Commission’s proposals for the seventh research framework programme COM(2005)119 final. envisage that the European Research Council (ERC) will finance individual research teams. In a similar way to the ‘excellence awards’ under the sixth research framework programme, it is foreseen that it will be possible for researchers in other parts of the world to put forward proposals, in conjunction with a prospective host institution within the EU, at which they will carry out the research. If they are successful in the peer review, this will allow, in particular, European researchers currently working in other countries to return to the EU to do high quality research. Through its delegations, the Commission will encourage researchers in this position to apply to the programme. In the United States, for example, the delegation has organised a network of EU national researchers which could be the medium by which information and support for this is given. The Commission’s proposals for the seventh research framework programme indicate clearly that the sole criterion of excellence should apply to the proposals under the ERC. Furthermore, the ERC will use a system of ‘individual project’ grants, giving maximum discretion to the researchers themselves to conduct the project in the interests of the scientific objectives, and with the minimal reporting requirements consistent with effective accountability.
