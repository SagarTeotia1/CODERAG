ORAL QUESTION H-1031/07 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Bogusław Sonik to the Commission Subject: Uniform treatment of guides in the EU Member States I would like to draw attention to a problem that has arisen following the adoption of Directive 2005/36/EC . In the Directive, legislators did not distinguish between the work of tour leaders in charge of tourist groups on trips and that of guides. A guide’s duties involve not only the successful organisation of trips but also the provision of factual information about the history, traditions and value of works of art or historical buildings. For this reason, guides also take specialised courses, at the end of which they are assessed by examination, prior to entering the occupation. The high level of courses and examinations ensures that a good quality of service is provided. It should be noted that in many European Union Member States, including Poland, the profession of guide is regulated. Documents attesting to the completion of courses and training are required to obtain qualifications. Equating tour leaders with guides will reduce the quality of the services provided for tourists. In order to prevent this from happening, an examination system should be introduced throughout Europe that will certify guides’ proficiency. Does the Commission envisage developing a system of courses and examinations for guides throughout Europe, the substance and organisation of which would be adapted accordingly by the individual Member States?
