Question for written answer E-001147/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Petru Constantin Luhan (PPE) (8 February 2012) Subject: Regional statistics At present, the Commission is striving to achieve robust quality management for European statistics, with COM(2011)0211 being proof of this. The strategy proposed by the Commission involves a set of measures, but the Commission’s recommendations and the code of best practice also need to be respected at the level of each Member State. In the case of regional development policy, and especially to ensure the complementarity of interventions at a local level, it is essential that the rules also be respected for statistics at that level. What does the Commission propose be done to ensure the quality of local and regional statistics? Does the Commission intend to grant financial assistance for this?
