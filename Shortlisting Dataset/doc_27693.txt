whereas progress in combating discrimination against Roma in the form of fulfilling their rights to education, employment, health and housing in both the Member States and candidate countries has been uneven and slow, H. whereas most Roma women face double discrimination as both Roma and women, 1. Condemns the recent rise of anti-Gypsyism (Romaphobia) across several EU Member States, which has taken the form of regular hate‑speech and anti-Roma attacks; 2. Considers that fighting discrimination against Roma, who are a pan-European community, requires a comprehensive approach at European level; 3. Expresses its concerns at the discrimination suffered by Roma in education (particularly segregation), housing (particularly forced evictions and sub-standard living conditions, often in ghettos), employment (their particularly low employment rate) and equal access to health care systems and other public services, as well as the astoundingly low level of their political participation; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that equal opportunity measures are strictly followed under the Structural Funds, so that projects do not directly or indirectly strengthen the segregation and exclusion of Roma; calls for rapid implementation of the revised ERDF regulations and in particular Article 7 thereof, which reinforces the role of the Structural Funds in housing policy; calls on the European Commission to ensure that the recently adopted Microfinance Facility is accessible to the Roma in order to support their integration into the labour market; 4.

Welcomes the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council’s conclusions on the Inclusion of Roma, adopted in Luxembourg on 8 June 2009, which integrate the Common Basic Principles on Roma Inclusion, and invite the Commission and the Member States to take account of them ‘when designing and implementing policies to defend fundamental rights, uphold gender equality, combat discrimination, poverty and social exclusion, and ensure access to education, housing, health, employment, social services, justice, sports and culture, and also in the EU’s relations with third countries’; welcomes the request to the Commission to ‘undertake concrete steps to make Community instruments and policies relevant for Roma inclusion more effective’; 7.
