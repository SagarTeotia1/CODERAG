Reply (27 May 2011) The Council would like to draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that Article 194(2) TFEU stipulates a Member State's right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply. The Council is therefore not in a position to provide information on the first question raised by the Honourable Member. As to the second question, the Council is not aware of any intentions such as the Honourable Member is referring to regarding the Krško nuclear power plant. However, the Council cannot reply on behalf of the other institutions.
