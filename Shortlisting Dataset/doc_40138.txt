WRITTEN QUESTION E-3730/07 by Gian Paolo Gobbo (UEN) to the Commission (20 July 2007) Subject: Transparency of, and comprehensive access to, airfares One of the main objectives of EU air-transport policy is to create transparency and to provide passengers with comprehensive, unrestricted access to airfares. To this end the Community has regulated CRSs (computerised reservation systems) in order to ensure that passengers can choose flights on the basis of comprehensive information presented clearly and impartially. However, passengers will not derive any benefit from such measures and they will have no assurance of transparency and comprehensive access to fares if airlines can continue to offer fares which differ according to the marketing method used. The European Union should take steps to maintain neutrality and access to airfares, as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 OJ L 220, 29.7.1989, p. 1. . Does the Commission intend to ensure that passengers enjoy the same transparency and the same access to airfares as they did when all fares where made available exclusively via CRSs? Will the Commission take advantage of the forthcoming revision of Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 on CRSs in order to tackle this major issue?
