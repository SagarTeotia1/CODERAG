Question for written answer E-001394/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (23 February 2011) Subject: Turkey — verbal harassment of women at work According to an article published in the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet on 9 January 2011, almost half the women recruited as street sweepers in the Kiziltepe region of Mardin province resigned little more than a day after being taken on because they were the target of serious verbal harassment from men in the street. The town had decided to employ women as well as men with the aim of eliminating gender‑based discrimination. The company responsible therefore took on 19 women out of a total of 120 employees. Could the Commission answer the following question: Is this social practice aimed at women in Turkey compatible with EC laws?
