3 November 1999 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION pursuant to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure by Mr Ortuondo Larrea on the transfer of the anchovy quota between stocks in the ICES IX and X and CECAF 34.1.1 areas and ICES area VIII Resolution on the transfer of the anchovy quota between stocks in the ICES IX and X and CECAF 34.1.1 areas and ICES area VIII The European Parliament, A. whereas Regulation (EC) No 685/95 facilitates the transfer of the anchovy quota from ICES areas IX and X and CECAF area 34.1.1 to ICES area VIII, B. whereas the sixth chamber of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg has dismissed an action on the grounds that it does not endanger stocks in the areas under scrutiny, C. whereas the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stipulates that, in the year 2000, anchovies in the Bay of Biscay as a separate stock and their biomass will fall below the safety levels and safe biological limits, D. whereas ICES recommends greater protection for breeding stocks; whereas the Council should not disregard this recommendation, E. whereas total allowable catches (TACs) should be fixed in line with precautionary principles; whereas the aforementioned transfer will involve an increase in the exploitation of resources which is out of step with the TAC control system, 1. Urges the Commission and the Council to regulate anchovy fishing in ICES area VIII for the year 2000 and subsequent years in line with the levels recommended by the ICES scientific management council, so as to guarantee the sustainable and responsible exploitation of this resource; 2. Urges the Commission and the Council to refrain from authorising transfers of quotas between biologically separate stocks, given that they undermine one of the chief instruments of the common fisheries policy aimed at guaranteeing conservation, namely total allowable catches.
