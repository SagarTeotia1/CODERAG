Question for written answer E-4778/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (28 June 2010) Subject: Alarming increase in premature births According to a recent report by the European Foundation for Care of Newborn Infants, the number of premature births is rising sharply and they are also the main cause of infant mortality. According to the Foundation, this increase and the emergence of long-term complications, such as respiratory and motor problems and mental deficiencies, could be curbed if the health of newborn infants was given priority as part of a common health policy. 1. Has the Commission taken measures and initiatives, within its competence, to coordinate Member States' policy on tackling the issue of premature births? 2. Does the Commission have sufficient information concerning the conditions in incubators in maternity wards and whether they meet the standards necessary to protect newborn infants' health? What information does the Commission have about the situation in Greece? 3. Does the Commission have comparative data for the Member States concerning the number of premature births?
