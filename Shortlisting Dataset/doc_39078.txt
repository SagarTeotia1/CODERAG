Question for written answer E-010601/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Seán Kelly (PPE) (17 November 2011) Subject: Introduction of minimum pricing of alcohol products In view of the scourge of binge drinking and its negative health effects and the increase in affordability of alcohol products in the last 15 years, for example in Ireland, where affordability has increased by 50 %, and also in the light of the below-cost selling of alcohol products by large retailers, can the Commission confirm that introducing minimum pricing regulations is in line with the Treaties, given the health and social benefits which such price regulation would promote?
