WRITTEN QUESTION E-1352/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (11 April 2005) Subject: Drugs and action by FYROM Last December the Presidency of the European Union drew up a report on the production, trafficking and use of drugs in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), on the basis of the conclusions of the ‘mini-Dublin Group’, which met in Skopje on 8 December 2004. The ‘mini-Dublin Group’ report states the FYROM is part of the notorious Balkans drug trafficking route, that minor progress has been made in combating drugs trafficking, that the absence of effective coordination in FYROM is evident and that drugs are entering FYROM from south-west Asia, in particular Afghanistan, through Turkey and Bulgaria. The same document provides information supplied by the FYROM Ministry of the Interior, that drugs-related crimes are steadily increasing (by 12.5 % in 2004): thus 253 cases of illegal drugs production and trafficking were detected last year. Has the Commission made it a precondition for closer ties between the EU and FYROM that the movement of drugs through that country cease? Has it taken the same step vis-à-vis Turkey, a drug-producing country, which is a link between one of the main drug-producing centres worldwide (Afghanistan) and the final destination of these drugs, Europe?
