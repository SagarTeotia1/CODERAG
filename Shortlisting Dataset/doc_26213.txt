Answer given by Mrs Hübner on behalf of the Commission (12 July 2006) The Honourable Member will find in the annex (which is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament’s Secretariat) a table with the Cohesion Fund projects currently open. It contains the open projects co-funded under the First Cohesion Fund, the new projects approved under the Second Cohesion Fund including those projects co-funded under the First Cohesion Fund which received additional funding from the Second Cohesion Fund. The latter are indicated with an asterisk. The table indicates for each project, as per May 2006, the decided amount in Community assistance, the amounts in assistance committed from the Community budget, and the amounts in Community assistance paid out. It should be noted that projects tend to be somewhat more advanced than shown by the figures in the table, as there is a time lag between the physical progress of a project and the moment at which its expenditure is declared to the Commission. The transport sector performs better than the environment, though both category projects show important delays in Greece. A variety of reasons can be at stake, such as insufficient project preparation, delays in expropriation procedures and in the issuing of environmental permits, the technical complexity of projects, and problems of compliance with Community law e.g. as regards environment legislation and public procurement.
