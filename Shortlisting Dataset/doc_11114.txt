Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2012) The EU's and euro area's overall current account is and has been broadly in balance. Expressed as a proportion of GDP the EU27's second-quarter deficit amounts to 1.1 % of GDP, while that of the euro area was slightly lower at 0.9 % of GDP. There are two main reasons why the Commission does not consider aggregate current account deficits of this size as a particular cause for concern per se. Firstly, these deficits are low by international standards compared to many large non-EU OECD economies running current account deficits. Secondly, EU and euro-area current account patterns have been very stable over the past decade, with the EU27's deficit having been close to balance since 2000 and the euro area fluctuating between surplus and deficit also within the +/-1 % of GDP band. With such small deficits at the EU and euro area level, the associated accumulation of net external debt is only taking place at an extremely slow pace. The latest autumn forecast by the Commission suggests that these well-balanced current account patterns at the aggregate level are expected to persist throughout the forecast horizon. However, it is important to note that these small aggregate deficits mask considerable variation at the Member State level. The Commission is advocating a wide range of policy measures to improve external competitivness for countries with high current account deficits such as Greece and Portugal, and more generally through growth-enhancing structural reform measures encompassed in the Europe 2020 strategy for growth. Macroeconomic imbalances such as high external deficit and debt levels will in future be closely monitored through the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure.
