Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (27 June 2006) The Commission is not aware of any threat made by the Turkish authorities about consequences if Turkey were not to accede to the European Union. The Commission recalls that the principles governing accession negotiations with Turkey are set out in the negotiating framework of 3 October 2005. Paragraph 1§2 states that ‘the shared objective of the negotiations is accession. These negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand. While taking account of all Copenhagen criteria, if Turkey is not in a position to assume in full all the obligations of membership it must be ensured that Turkey is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible bond.’ The negotiating framework also states that progress in the negotiation will be measured, inter alia , against ‘the fulfilment of Turkey’s obligations under the association agreement and its additional protocol extending the association agreement to all new EU Member States, in particular those pertaining to the EU‑Turkey customs union, as well as the implementation of the accession partnership, as regularly revised.’
