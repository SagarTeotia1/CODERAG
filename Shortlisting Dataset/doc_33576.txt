Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (19 April 2007) Member States' authorities are in principle free to decide where to locate a waste landfill. However, they have to respect Annex I 1.1e of Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste OJ L 182, 16.7.1999 . (Landfill Directive) according to which the location of a landfill must take into consideration requirements relating to the protection of nature or the cultural patrimony in the area, as well as 1.1b that requires account be taken of the existence of groundwater, coastal water or nature protection zones. Furthermore Article 4, 1c of Directive 2006/12/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste OJ L 114, 27.4.2006 . (Directive on Waste), states that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of and, in particular, without adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest. Since the project referred to in the Honourable Members' question does not aim at constructing a landfill site but rather a quarry and concrete production plant, the Commission cannot ask that the procedures, as laid down in Council Directive 1999/31/EC, be respected, even under the condition that the site might, in later years, be used as a waste disposal site. Only if that were to be the case the requirements of the Landfill Directive would have to be fully met, subject to a full permit procedure within the limits of the directive on Waste as well as the Landfill Directive. If the site was later to be used for the disposal of waste, the permit would require the type of waste disposal site and, subject to specification depending on whether the requirements of the Landfill Directive were met, would not allow any other waste to be deposited than specified in the permit. Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 . (Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive) as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 . and Directive 2003/35/EC OJ L 156, 25.6.2003 . , requires that before development consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia , of their nature, size or location are made subject to an assessment of their environmental effects. These projects are defined in Article 4 which refers to Annexes I and II of the directive. For Annex I projects an EIA is carried out, for Annex II projects Member States have to determine (in a procedure called ‘screening’) if they are likely to have significant effects on the environment. If they are, an EIA must be carried out. Quarries fall within the scope of the EIA Directive and can be found either in Annex I (19) or Annex II (2)(a) depending on their size. Quarries and open-cast mining where the surface of the site exceeds 25 hectares, or peat extraction, where the surface of the site exceeds 150 hectares,
