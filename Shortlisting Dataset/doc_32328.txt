for victims Victims should receive accommodation, material assistance and where necessary medical treatment, including psychological assistance. Legal counselling and legal representation should be free of charge, at least when the victim lacks sufficient financial resources. Victims of trafficking should also have access to witness protection programmes and to compensation schemes. Assistance and support should be provided “before, during and for an appropriate time after criminal proceedings”, irrespective of a victim's willingness to act as a witness. A requirement not to prosecute or impose penalties on victims is explicitly stated in the text. To discourage demand, Member States should also “consider taking measures to establish as a criminal offence the use of services” of a victim, with the knowledge that he/she has been trafficked. Several hundred thousand people are trafficked into or within the EU each year. Many victims are exploited for prostitution (43%, overwhelmingly women and girls), or for menial labour (32%). The directive was approved with 643 votes in favour, 10 against and 14 abstentions. It will not apply to Denmark or the UK, but the latter may opt in later. 20101214IPR09488 Adopted text will be available here (click on 14 December) Procedure file on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims Press release (29.11.2010) on committee vote Profile of rapporteur Anna HEDH (S&D, SE) Profile of rapporteur Edit BAUER (EPP, SK) EN 1 LINK /activities/plenary/ta/calendar.do?language=EN EN 2 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5849482 EN 3 LINK /en/pressroom/content/20101129IPR02528/html/Tougher-rules-to-combat-trafficking-in-human-beings EN 4 LINK /members/public/geoSearch/view.do?country=SE&partNumber=1&language=EN&id=28131 EN 5 LINK /members/public/yourMep/view.do?name=Bauer&partNumber=1&language=EN&id=23866 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
