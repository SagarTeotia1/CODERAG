Joint answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-006403/11 , E-006961/11 (22 August 2011) The Commission is extremely concerned by the ongoing repression by Belarusian authorities of civil society representatives and opposition leaders. This includes the case of Andrzej Poczobut from Hrodna, a correspondent of the leading Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza , and a leader of the non-recognised Union of Poles in Belarus. Mr Poczobut was taken in custody on 6 April 2011 and charged on 13 May 2011 with insulting the President (Article 368 of the Criminal Code of Belarus) and with defaming the President (Article 367 of the Criminal Code of Belarus). On 6 July 2011, after a trial conducted behind closed doors, a district judge in Hrodna handed a deferred three-year prison sentence to Andrzej Poczobut. After spending three months in pre-trial detention, the journalist was released from custody when the verdict was announced. Both before and since 19 December 2010, according to the Commission's information, the authorities have been relentlessly pressuring Andrzej Poczobut in what appears to be retaliation for his journalistic activities. Ms Andzelika Orechwo (Anzhalika Arekhva) and Mr Igor Bancer (Ihar Bantsar) were among the approximately 1 900 silent protesters subject to the Belarusian authorities’ brutal handling while they peacefully and legitimately expressed their discontent over the situation in the country. The EU Delegation continues to follow developments closely concerning these and similar cases. The case of Andrzej Poczobut has been highlighted in the Statement of 10 April 2011 by the Spokesperson of the High Representative/Vice-President http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/121437.pdf , in the conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June 2011 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/122926.pdf , as well as on several occasions in EU statements in the OSCE Permanent Council, latest on 7 July 2011 http://www.delvie.ec.europa.eu/en/eu_osce/eu_statements/2011/July/PC%20no.873 %20-%20EU%20on%20BELR.pdf . In a spokesperson statement on 16 July 2011 the High Representative/Vice-President condemned the explicit targeting by the authorities of journalists who cover the silent protests http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/123894.pdf . The Commission and the High Representative remain ready to support all appropriate actions, including sustained political pressure and possible further targeted restrictive measures in all areas of cooperation, to respond to developments and to support victims of repression.
