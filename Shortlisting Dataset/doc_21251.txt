biodiversity, trade, development, agriculture, innovation, transport, animal welfare and the Europe 2020 strategy; believes that sound strategic management of the agricultural sector’s potential would put Europe well on its way to becoming a competitive player in tomorrow’s low-carbon global economy; 108. Stresses that the food chain should be shorter and more transparent and that the consumption of locally produced food should be encouraged, including support for local and regional markets, in order to reduce agricultural production’s transport-related emissions; stresses that relocating European multifunctional production and processing to non-EU countries would have a negative impact on European added value and on climate goals; 109. Believes that better livestock feed management, including protein crops in arable rotations and increasing the diversity of protein crops in permanent pasture mixes, in order to grow more animal feed on-farm, would reduce dependence on animal feed imports with a high carbon cost; believes that this would also reduce animal feed costs for farmers, and result in better soil management, by increasing soil water retention and also reducing susceptibility to pests; 110. Supports the idea that EU funds, including the Rural Development Fund, should only fund projects for agricultural facilities that are energy-efficient, and in particular those employing renewable energy sources that can reduce carbon emissions to a level as close as possible to zero; Financing 111. Supports the proposals made by the Commission for the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 to provide dedicated funding to increase investment and promote the development and application of low-carbon technologies; endorses the intention to mainstream climate-related funding of the total MFF and earmark 20 % of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for renewable energy and energy- efficient investment, while insisting that this must be effectively monitored; recommends that the Commission should ensure that particular use is made of this funding to assist Member States which have a high potential for reducing emissions below the existing targets but lack the capacity to make the necessary investment; 112. Points out that the current financial and economic crisis must be borne in mind when designing policies to ensure and support upfront investments which contribute to increased renewable energy sources, in order to reduce energy costs in the long term and improve energy efficiency in the fields of energy provision and transport; 113. Recalls that the long-term economic costs of not taking action to prevent climate change far outweigh the short-term costs of taking strong and decisive action now; 114. Hopes that concrete and measurable targets will swiftly be established for each sector, in order to encourage private investors and inspire confidence and cooperation among them, while promoting the better use of European funds; stresses that renewable energy, innovation and the development and deployment of breakthrough technologies can contribute to the fight against climate change and, at the same time, help convince the EU’s partners worldwide that emissions reductions are feasible without losing competitiveness or putting job creation at risk; considers it essential that the EU and its Member States should set an example in establishing a system for investment in new, energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies;
