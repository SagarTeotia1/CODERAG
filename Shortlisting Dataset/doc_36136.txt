Answer given by Mrs Hübner on behalf of the Commission (7 April 2005) Financial corrections and the subsequent recovery of undue payments by national authorities are an intrinsic part of the control system required for the Structural Funds and as part of its audit work in Member States and in its contacts with national control authorities the Commission checks that this element of systems is functioning properly. However, the Commission cannot give figures for the financial corrections made by each Member State. It refers the Honourable Member to the general report on the system for reporting and following up irregularities, which the Directorate General for Regional Policy of the Commission and OLAF sent to Parliament in January 2004. For the current programme period, the Commission is in the process of applying the first financial corrections. It is currently engaged in auditing programmes in all Member States and for all funds and will ensure that financial corrections are applied where justified as a result of these audits.
