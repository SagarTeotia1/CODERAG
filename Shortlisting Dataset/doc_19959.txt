The implementation deadline in the original Commission proposal consequently should be reinstated. It is thus essential for the Commission and the Council to be in a position to determine as soon as possible after expiry of the final implementation deadline whether the directive is being implemented appropriately. In order to reach a compromise with the Council, and to ensure that enough practical experience is acquired with the directive, the deadline of 5 years proposed by the Council is being shortened by this amendment, not to 2 years, as in the original Commission proposal, but to 4 years.
