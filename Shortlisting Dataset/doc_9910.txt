finance from the EBRD; 6. Welcomes the principle of additionality in the EBRD's investment policy; stresses the need to encourage local, dynamic firms and, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses; acknowledges, however, the need to support larger businesses if they develop entire value-added chains which then work for the regional market or if, as a result of major political instability, these firms encounter serious difficulties in developing and carrying out their projects; 7. Points out that Article 2 of the Agreement explicitly lays down the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses as part of the EBRD's mandate; emphasises the special role of small and medium-sized firms in creating and securing training places and jobs; therefore expects the EBRD to step up its involvement and thereby help to boost the capital base of such firms, especially in Russia, where only 10% of the workforce is employed in small and medium-sized firms; 8. Welcomes the outstanding results of the micro-financing projects (loans of EUR 8000 on average) and supports the EBRD's intention of extending this programme to all project countries; 9. Reaffirms its belief that support for the process of transition is not just a matter of the amount of funding, but also includes the transmission of experience and knowledge to business and public administrations, so as to ensure the optimum use of the financial resources made available and achieve the requisite pace of transition to a fully democratic, pluralistic and market-orientated structure; 10. Notes that there are substantial differences between the levels of EBRD financing in the more highly developed countries and in the weaker countries; in this connection, welcomes the new EBRD strategy of focusing more on the least-developed countries in the Caucasus and in Central Asia; notes that investment is badly needed in Russia and the Ukraine, provided that the national and local authorities demonstrate their resolve to continue on the path of reform; notes that the process of transition in Central and Eastern Europe is far from complete even in the most highly advanced countries, and calls for active policies to be continued after their accession to the European Union; 11. Regrets the fact that the EBRD has not managed to present any analysis of the effects of its operations in the countries and regions in transition in relation to economic data such as productivity, company turnover, employment, wages and salaries, etc.; 12. Takes the view that the EBRD should not attempt to operate in the same way in every country, but should tailor its policies to local circumstances, instead; considers, in particular, that the EBRD should respect political decisions taken by democratically elected governments, and consequently should not influence the division between the public and private sectors in each country; Recommendations 13. Recommends that the focus should gradually shift to more equity investment, which would both signal the EBRD's willingness to promote the development of local firms in the medium and long term with much needed risk capital and to develop public markets for such investments with increasing local participation; 14. Recommends that the EBRD pursue an integrated approach
