Convention must provide for a simple, single, binding mechanism for settling disputes, in order to develop, in international law, case law relating to cultural diversity. MEPs say the Convention must very clearly underline the right of States to develop, maintain and implement policies and laws designed to promote cultural diversity and media pluralism, notably regarding pubic broadcasters, to ensure their democratic and social relevance for their societies. For this reason, the Convention should recognise the importance of both direct and indirect public financial aid and that States may determine the nature, amount and beneficiaries of such aid. MEPs also insist that the Convention must be based upon the principles of individual human rights as laid down in international instruments, which would prevent the concept of cultural diversity being used as a pretext for practices which contravene human rights.
