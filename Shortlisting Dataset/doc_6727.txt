Joint answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-4934/08 , E-4935/08 (29 October 2008) According to Directive 2002/49/EC OJ L 189, 18.7.2002. relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise, maps have to be made using the noise exposure indicators of Lden greater than 55 decibels (dB) and Lnight greater than 50 dB. In addition, measures included in Member State action plans should apply in particular to the most important areas as established by strategic noise mapping. The Environmental Noise Directive, adopted by Parliament and the Council in 2002, does not prescribe a methodology or rules on how to delimit quiet areas. Instead, it leaves considerable discretion to the Member States. At this time the Commission has no information about the effectiveness or otherwise of the ‘quiet area’ provisions though information may emerge during the foreseen review of the Environmental Noise Directive. Member States are required to prepare noise maps for agglomerations in two phases. The first phase had to be completed by June 2007 for those agglomerations with more than 250 000 inhabitants whilst the second phase for smaller agglomerations in excess of 100 000 inhabitants will have to be completed by June 2012. The directive does not prescribe a single methodology or set of rules for defining agglomerations. Instead, it stipulates that an agglomeration should be a part of the Member State's territory containing in excess of 100 000 persons and with a population density such that the Member State considers it to be an urbanised area. This leaves considerable discretion to the Member State on how to establish agglomerations for the purposes of the directive and the Member States may choose to base their decisions on administrative or political boundaries as they see fit. However and irrespective of how a Member State defines its agglomerations, an obligation existed to have established noise maps for those agglomerations in existence at the end of June 2007 and which contained in excess of 250 000 inhabitants. Once an agglomeration has been identified, the Member State must map the exposure to noise in the agglomeration. This includes all roads regardless of the number of vehicle passages.
