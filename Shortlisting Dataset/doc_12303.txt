Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (24 July 2007) EU water protection legislation is protecting all our waters (rives, lakes, ground waters and coastal waters), and addressing all human impacts on these waters. Key elements of EU water protection legislation are: — the Water Framework Directive of 2000 Directive 2000/60/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000. , obliging Member States to cooperate in shared river basins and to jointly establish river basin management plans and programmes of measures by 22 December 2009, in order to achieve good status for all waters, as a rule by 22 December 2015; this deadline applies to all 27 Member States; — the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive of 1991 Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste water treatment, OJ L 135, 30.5.1991. , obliging Member States to collect and treat waste water from all settlement areas (‘agglomerations’) above 2000 inhabitants or the equivalent in waste water ‘Population equivalent’ (p.e.) = measurement unit for waste water pollution, with one p.e. equalling the average daily pollution of one person. ; deadlines were 1998, 2000 and 2005 respectively, depending on the size of the ‘agglomeration’ and the characteristics of the affected waters. However, there are considerable extensions of these deadlines set out within the Accession Treaties for the new Member States which acceded the EU in 2004 and 2007; compliance has to be achieved by the following deadlines (complemented by staged intermediate deadlines): Bulgaria: until 2014 Cyprus: until 2012 Czech Republic: until 2010 Estonia: until 2010 Hungary: until 2015 Latvia: until 2015 Lithuania: until 2009 Malta: until 2007 Poland: until 2015 Romania: until 2018 Slovakia: until 2015 Slovenia: until 2015; — the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, OJ L 257, 10.1.1996. of 1996, obliging Member States to ensure pollution prevention and reduction based on best available technique, for new industrial installations as well as (after a transition period defined in Article 5) for existing installations. However, there are considerable extensions of these deadlines set out within the Accession Treaties for the new Member States which acceded the EU in 2004 and 2007; compliance has to be achieved by the following deadlines (in each case linked to specific installations): Bulgaria: until 2008/2011 Latvia: until 2010 Poland: until 2009/2010 Romania: until 2008/2009/2010/2011/2012/2013/2014/2015 Slovakia: until 2010/2011 Slovenia: until 2008/2010/2011; — the Dangerous Substances Directive Council Directive 76/464/EEC of 4 May 1976 on pollution by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community, OJ L 129, 18.5.1976, repealed by Directive 2006/11/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2006. , obliging Member States to establish and implement pollution reduction programmes for certain substances. Industrial waste water from tanneries (as well as waste water from other production sectors) may be treated and discharged either in a treatment plant together with urban waste water (under the condition of prevention
