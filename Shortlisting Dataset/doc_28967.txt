Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (4 April 2005) The Commission is pleased to provide the Honourable Member with the following statistics: German Spanish French British Italian Total Population % of all A-grade officials 12.3% 9.6% 13.0% 9.0% 11.1% 100% N° of all A*16 (%) 10 (17.9%) 6 (10.7%) 7 (12.5%) 7 (12.5%) 6 (10.7%) 56 N° of Directors General 6 3 5 4 3 30 N° of all A*15 (%) 27 (11.8%) 25 (10.9%) 36 (15.7%) 31 (13.5%) 18 (7.9%) 229 N° of all A*14 (%) 71 (10.9%) 53 (8.2%) 114 (17.6%) 68 (10.5%) 63 (9.7%) 649 N° of all A*13 (%) 0 (0%) 1 (4.3%) 6 (26.1%) 2 (8.7%) 1 (4.3%) 23 The Commission would like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that according to the principles underlying the Staff Regulation, senior official appointments must target ‘officials of the highest standard of ability, efficiency and integrity’. The primary criterion for the appointment of senior officials is merit and competence relevant to the function. In accordance with Article 27 of the Staff Regulations, which states that ‘recruitment shall be directed to securing for the institution the services of officials […], recruited on the broadest possible geographical basis from among nationals of Member States of the Communities’, no posts shall be reserved for nationals of any specific Member States, except where specific regulations provide otherwise. The Commission aims at maintaining a broad geographical balance in order to ensure a fair spread of all the nationalities of the European Union (EU) within the staff at all grades and in all departments of the Institution, thereby guaranteeing the cultural wealth and cohesion of the European civil service. The Commission has formally stated that the nationality of an outgoing post-holder may not be a factor in the appointment of a new occupant of a post. The Commission does not apply quotas at any level of posts for its officials although it considers it a desirable objective that each nationality should hold at least one function corresponding to the post of Director-General or equivalent (Deputy Director-General, Deputy Secretary-General, etc).
