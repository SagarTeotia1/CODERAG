WRITTEN QUESTION E-1135/09 by Flaviu Călin Rus (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (24 February 2009) Subject: Projects in support of national labour market reintegration programmes in the eastern European Member States Romania's accession to the EU led immediately to hundreds of thousands of Romanians migrating to take up jobs in construction and agriculture, especially in Member States such as Italy and Spain. In the wake of the economic crisis which was anticipated in late 2008 and began in 2009, large numbers of these Romanians have lost their jobs and been obliged to return to Romania, although that country too is suffering from the crisis. Is the Commission considering projects for the eastern European Member States which would support national labour market reintegration programmes for people in this situation, should the countries concerned not be able to find jobs for all those seeking them?
