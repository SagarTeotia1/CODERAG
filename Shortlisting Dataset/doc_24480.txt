and the quality of and access to services; emphasises that services of general interest have a major role to play in putting sustainable development into effect; calls on the Commission as a matter of urgency to complete its proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest, its proposal on the establishment of guidelines on state aid, and the group exemptions regulation; 12. Takes the view that selective labour mobility can contribute to overcoming current bottlenecks in European labour markets and that it should be balanced by regional policies to prevent the situation worsening for economically weaker regions and organised migration between regions and resulting social conflicts in Europe. Insists that labour mobility should respect the right of each jobseeker to freely choose the place of employment; 13 . Recalls that the mobility of labour in border regions is limited in many respects by factors arising partly from administrative difficulties owing to discrepancies in such matters as social insurance and taxation systems, and calls on the Commission to take initiatives seeking in various ways to remove barrriers to mobility in border regions; 14. Accuses the Commission of paying too little attention to the potential impact of enlargement on employment and social affairs including in the existing Member States, and refers to its reports on enlargement; 15. Urges the Commission to adopt measures of all kinds, including training measures for the applicant countries, in order to avoid splits in society and the collapse of the European social model in an enlarged Europe; 16. Considers that the economic guidelines should take account of the social cohesion situation in the Union, and that these guidelines should stress the importance of social developments in the regions of the Union being to some extent in face with with each other; 17. Looks to the Commission to produce an employment strategy giving everyone the opportunity to participate in economic life and helping to create a dynamic and well-functioning labour market which will provide to all employees, who want it, high-quality and productive jobs; 18. Notes the lack of a clear will for economic reforms in order to increase the EU’s growth and employment potential.
