Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (8 December 2008) The Commission has no detailed information about the routes taken by the Pacific Heron, a vessel flying the United Kingdom flag and chartered by British Nuclear Group Sellafield, a UK company, nor is it aware of any emergency or any other incident relating to the vessel in question. There is no reason to conclude, therefore, that national, Community or international legislation has not been observed during the journeys made by the Pacific Heron. Since 1992 Directive 92/3/Euratom will be repealed by 25 December 2008 and replaced by Directive 2006/117/Euratom of 20 November 2006 on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel. the European Union has had a common, compulsory system of prior authorisation for shipments of radioactive waste between Member States as well as into and out of the Community. This system does not allow the Commission to monitor or track such nuclear transports; it is merely a system of notification and authorisation between the competent authorities involved. Furthermore, the evaluation of the safety and security arrangements for shipments carrying nuclear waste between Member States does not fall within the competence of the Commission. Safety and security arrangements for these shipments must respect international and national regulations concerning the transport of radioactive material. The Office of Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) in the United Kingdom (UK) is responsible for regulating the secure transport of ‘sensitive categories’ of nuclear material by civil nuclear operators. In this context, the Office is the UK’s designated national authority under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, for shipments to and from overseas destinations.
