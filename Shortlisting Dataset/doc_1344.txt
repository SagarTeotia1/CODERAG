Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (18 October 2005) When signing the additional protocol to the Ankara agreement on 29 July 2005, Turkey attached a declaration concerning relations with Cyprus. In reply, the Union adopted on 21 September a declaration stressing that ‘the declaration by Turkey is unilateral, does not form part of the Protocol and has no legal effect on Turkey’s obligations under the Protocol’. The Commission expects Turkey to implement fully the additional protocol and to remove all restrictions on the free movement of goods, including restrictions relating to Cyprus on access to Turkish ports and airports, which affect the free movement of goods, as underlined in point 3 of the declaration of the EU. The Commission will monitor the implementation of the protocol with the instruments at its disposal, including the Customs Union Joint Committee. In case the protocol is not implemented correctly, the EU can have recourse to the applicable dispute settlement mechanisms. Moreover, as stated in the EU declaration, ‘the opening of negotiations on the relevant chapters depends on Turkey’s implementation of its contractual obligations to all Member States. Failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations’. The conditions under which accession negotiations with Turkey started on 3 October 2005 were established by the EU Member States in the negotiating framework: Accession negotiations take place in the framework of an inter-governmental conference where decisions require unanimity and with full participation of all 25 EU members. The negotiating framework with Turkey also stresses that progress in the negotiations should be measured, inter alia , against ‘progress in the normalisation of bilateral relations between Turkey and all EU Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus’.
