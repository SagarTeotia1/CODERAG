Question for written answer E-007975/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Toussas (GUE/NGL) (9 September 2011) Subject: Danger to the health and safety of workers The PASOK government has recently drawn up a new list of arduous and hazardous occupations under the provisions of Law 3863/2010, which are unfavourable in terms of social insurance and the interests of workers, and the updated Memorandum of Understanding signed by the ‘troika’, under which arduous and hazardous professions are defined not on a scientific basis but in accordance with a criterion which is shamelessly biased against the interests of workers, to the effect that no more than 10 % of the Greek workforce can be covered by the relevant arrangements, in a bid to achieve a drastic reduction in labour costs while boosting corporate profits. This is resulting in the exclusion of dozens of sectors, specialist areas and trades currently employing around 140 000 workers, leading to a more intensive pace of work and an increase in retirement age, forcing those concerned to work well into old age under dangerous conditions and resulting in an increase in the number of industrial accidents with tragic consequences for the life and health of workers. In 2006 alone industrial accidents or work-related illnesses claimed the lives of 167 000 workers, that is to say one every three-and-a-half minutes. The Labour Inspectorate has recorded 1 000 fatal industrial accidents in Greece over the last seven years and 20 000 serious industrial ‘accidents’ in the three years from 2003 to 2005. — What view does the Commission take of the exclusion of sectors, specialist areas and trades from the list of arduous and hazardous occupations, the gradual phasing out of he list itself and the highly adverse effect that this will have on workers in terms of their health, safety and remuneration? — What scientific criteria, studies and analyses are used to assess work-related risks and measures to protect the health and life of workers, particularly in view of the more intensive pace of work and the increasingly widespread use of flexible employment arrangements?
