9999/C Q999 E/023 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1344/04 by Camilo Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (21 April 2004) Subject: Productivity gains in the cohesion States Has the Commission carried out any research which might account for the varying degree of success with which the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund have been applied in the various cohesion States? Such variation is apparent from the differences in the productivity-gain and job-creation rate achieved in the countries concerned. Ireland's rate has reached almost 4% per year and the figure for Portugal corresponds to the EU average, whereas Spain has achieved no more than half of the average.
