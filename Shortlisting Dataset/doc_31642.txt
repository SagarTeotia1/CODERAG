Question for written answer E-002132/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Simon Busuttil (PPE) (4 March 2011) Subject: Follow-up to the suspension of EU funding for Maltese students In its response to my parliamentary question of 25 October 2010 (E‑9152/2010), the Commission confirmed that it is currently carrying out an evaluation of the verification process carried out in Malta prior to resuming funding for the ‘Lifelong Learning’ and ‘Youth in Action’ programmes. These programmes are absolutely essential to reinforcing the value attached to European citizenship by young people, students and educators. This being so, it is highly regrettable to see the pace with which things are progressing. Without undermining the importance of thorough and robust administrative procedures, it is imperative that the matter be resolved as soon as possible. Can the Commission confirm that it is treating this as a matter of urgency? Can the Commission also state when it expects to complete the evaluation process?
