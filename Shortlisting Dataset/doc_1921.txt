ORAL QUESTION H-0575/05 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Dimitrios Papadimoulis to the Council Subject: Statements by Mr Gül concerning the Patriarchate and the Halki School of Theology In statements made to the Turkish press on 27 June 2005, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Gül, expressly ruled out the possibility of the Turkish Government recognising the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate and made it clear that the issue of the Halki School of Theology was being examined on the basis of current Turkish law, which meant that the School would not be re-opening. In the light of the European Council's conclusions of December 2004 and the Commission's announcements of December 2004 concerning Turkey's progress, which contained an express reference to the religious rights of the non-Muslim communities, what is the Council's reaction to these statements by Mr Gül?
