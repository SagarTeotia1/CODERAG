Question for written answer E-006509/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kathleen Van Brempt (S&D) (7 July 2011) Subject: Small-scale wind potential in towns The construction of large-scale windmills at sea and on land has proved its usefulness and there appears to be potential for growth by means of increases in scale and efficiency. Worldwide the market for wind energy is growing strongly. Obviously, initially, all attention was directed towards constant, sufficiently powerful wind movements for setting up large-scale investment of this kind. Nevertheless there may also be considerable scope for generating wind energy in urban areas, especially in towns that are located on rivers or which have high buildings. Towns also contain areas where there are semi-permanent air currents. Although these are generally not so strong, change direction more often and are more turbulent than in the country or at sea, there are undoubtedly possibilities for small-scale decentralised energy generation. Initiatives that are often rather small-scale are gradually being taken, where wind turbines are placed on roofs and on (or even in) façades, so street lighting can be combined not only with solar panels but with wind turbines and the like. A couple of notable examples are the World Trade Center in Bahrain and the planned COR Building in Miami. At present the cost efficiency is often still low, but there is a lack of adequate data on local, turbulent air flows in towns and round buildings and on pilot projects. 1. Does the Commission recognise the potential for wind energy in towns? 2. Does the Commission have information about research projects (with or without European financial support) for mapping turbulent wind flows in towns and round buildings or pilot projects on small-scale wind turbines incorporated into buildings in the EU? 3. Is the Commission prepared to take the initiative of investigating its own buildings’ potential for integrated wind energy?
