Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (14 July 2003) In accordance with the role assigned to it by Article 155 of the EC Treaty, the Commission maintains regular and abundant correspondence with the national authorities on the implementation and appropriate use of EU funds granted to projects contributing to environmental objectives and on the correct application of EU environmental legislation. The number of letters sent in each case depends on a number of factors. For instance, the investigation of a complaint concerning the application of EU environmental law may comprise several stages involving the dispatch of many successive letters. When the Commission considers that there is an infringement, it may initiate the procedure provided for by Article 226 of the EC Treaty which may lead to the matter being brought before the Court of Justice, preceded by the dispatch of a letter of formal notice and of a reasoned opinion. However, it is materially and technically impossible to produce statistics showing the total number of letters which the Commission has sent to the Greek authorities since 1994. However, it is possible to produce general statistics on the number of complaints or infringements relating to transposition and application of EU environmental legislation in Greece.
