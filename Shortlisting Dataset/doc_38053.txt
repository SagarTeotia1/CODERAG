Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) The Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) was developed by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in the 1980s and not by Internal Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) as stated. However consistent with normal scientific method the approach has since been developed, refined and updated with the input of many scientists including those working under the auspices of ILSI. Members of the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) Scientific Panels and Scientific Committee are required to complete an annual declaration of interests which are published on the EFSA website. The TTC approach was developed to address the safety of exposure to chemicals at levels that would result in exceedingly small human exposures which has become increasingly apparent due to improvements in the sensitivity of analytical methods. The EFSA Scientific Committee also makes it clear in its draft opinion that the approach would not be applied when there is a legislative requirement for submission of toxicity data and therefore it could not result in a means to avoid safety testing nor to facilitate easy access to the market. The availability of increased analytical sensitivity and the TTC approach facilitates the assessment of chemical residues that would have not been possible previously and thereby increases consumer protection. With regard to the issue of conflict of interest, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its reply to Written Question E‑04782/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB which deals with independence and conflicts of interest which apply across all the activities of EFSA. The EFSA Management Board recently adopted the Authority’s new Policy on independence and scientific decision-making processes which may be consulted on the EFSA website.
