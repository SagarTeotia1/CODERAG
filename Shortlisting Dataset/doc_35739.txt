WRITTEN QUESTION E-4928/06 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (16 November 2006) Subject: Turks used prisoners taken in invasion of Cyprus as guinea pigs According to a report published in the American journal ‘Defense and Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy’ in October 2006, missing persons who were taken prisoner by the Turkish invasion forces in 1974 were used as guinea pigs in military chemical facilities in Turkey. What sanctions are provided in Community legislation for such a bestial act which mirrors in every detail the barbarity of the Nazi concentration camps? What are the possible repercussions for Turkey as a consequence of the equally brutal conduct of that country and its instrument of policy in Cyprus for decades, Rauf Denktash, who refuses to say what happened to the 1619 Greeks, Cypriots, Americans, British and other nationals who were taken prisoner by the Turkish forces which invaded Cyprus in 1974?
