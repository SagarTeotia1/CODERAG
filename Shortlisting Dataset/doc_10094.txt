9999/C Q999 E/018 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0465/04 by José Ribeiro e Castro (UEN) to the Commission (06 February 2004) Subject: Establishing the 'Made in EU' label Various recent media reports indicate that the Commission is preparing a proposal for a Made in EU label, and the consequent abolition of national labels. Their reports claim that the idea came from Italy, in response to the enormous harm suffered by the European textile industry as a result of imitations made in developing countries, but that it has now swelled to embrace the general problem of the labelling of all products manufactured within the Union. - Is there any truth in these reports? - Is the Commission going to put forward some proposal in this field, embodying this or other ideas? - If the reports are correct, what does the Commission think are the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a Made in EU label, to the detriment of nationally-based labels? What kind of studies did the Commission use to arrive at these findings on advantages and disadvantages? - What are the forecast additional costs that such a measure would involve? - Does the Commission not think that eliminating any reference to national origin in labelling could in fact prejudice the competitiveness of many European products, whose market edge is provided precisely by the fact that they come from a specific Member State?
