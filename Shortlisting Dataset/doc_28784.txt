Reply (2 June 2010) As the Honourable Member indicated in his question, the payment of travel expenses from the place of work to the place of origin for permanent officials is governed by Article 8 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, while for temporary agents and contract agents with at least nine months' seniority it is governed by Articles 26 and 92 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants. As already stated in replies to previous similar questions ( H‑0069/08 — referring to years 2005, 2006 and 2007, E‑1487/10 — referring to years 2008 and 2009 — by the Honourable Mr Hans-Peter Martin, and E‑4130/09 by the Honourable Member referring to 2008), in conformity with said rules the payments are made automatically on a flat-rate basis, rather than upon request and on the basis of supporting evidence; thus, the numbers entitled to such payments and the numbers benefiting from them are identical. In 2009 there were 2 661 officials, temporary agents and contract agents entitled to the payments by the Council of travel expenses under these rules; the total outlay was EUR 4 898 993,68. Finally, it should be pointed out that figures for 2009 are provisional, as some adjustments are still possible this year both to the number of entitled persons and to the amounts.
