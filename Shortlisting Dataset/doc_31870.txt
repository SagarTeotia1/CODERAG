of 6 May 1999. b. The Council, the Commission and the European Parliament confirm that the classification of the expenditure in Articles 30-34, Title III "Financial Provisions" of the Act of Accession, annexed to the draft Accession Treaty will constitute non-compulsory expenditure after 2009. 2. The Commission confirms that its proposal for a financial framework (2007-2013) is based on the assumption that Bulgaria and Romania will be Member States on 1 January 2007. The European Parliament and the Council take note of the indicative amounts, for Bulgaria and Romania, provided by the Commission in March 2004 and considered by the Council in its conclusions of 22 March 2004 on "the financial package for the accession negotiations for Bulgaria and Romania". The financing of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will be ensured without jeopardising the commitments for existing multiannual programmes. 3. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission recall the importance of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 in the functioning of budgetary procedures and that this can only function if all the institutions comply fully.
