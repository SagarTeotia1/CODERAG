Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (15 May 2009) The Commission is extremely concerned by the violations of human rights, harassment of and violence towards human rights defenders, unwarranted arrests, evictions in Zimbabwe and in particular at the critical situation in the prisons, which according to our information is still deteriorating. This matter has been recently raised again with the Zimbabwe political authorities. In a recent meeting with the Justice Minister, Honourable Patrick Chinamasa, the Head of the EU Delegation raised the Commission's concerns on prisons conditions. A joint visit to prisons was requested which was agreed on principle by the Minister. It has been made clear that while the Commission stands ready to provide support and assistance to all prisoners in need, access to prisoners should be authorised without restrictions. The Commission has received assurances that access is now possible as requested and Commission officials in Harare are in contact with the administration concerned to provide the necessary assistance to prisoners. The EU Delegation is also in close contact with relevant organisations to assess what more could be done and see how best the EU could support. A multi-sectoral support programme to prisons which provides the opportunity to launch a wider reflection on the functioning of the prison system beyond the humanitarian assistance is envisaged. Regular communication will be maintained with the Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, who personally requested the EU Delegation to assist with conditions in prisons. Although the situation remains extremely serious and needs to be followed closely, positive signs in this respect are the personal attention of Prime Minister Tsvangirai and the fact that the Government 100-day Action Plan highlights as one of its major commitments the need to meet urgently the basic requirements of prisoners in terms of food, clothing, bedding and health.
