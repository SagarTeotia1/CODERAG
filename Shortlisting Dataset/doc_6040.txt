Question for written answer E-011969/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (3 January 2012) Subject: Franzoni crisis One hundred and sixty employees of a factory in Trani belonging to the former Franzoni (textiles, clothing and footwear) group have had no work for over a year. Three times in recent months, factory employees have climbed up a church tower and threatened to throw themselves off it in protest against being laid off under the ‘mobility procedure’. Since 2007, the factory owners have made several unsuccessful attempts to bring other entrepreneurs on board to prevent it from being closed down; meanwhile the employees, despite the efforts of the local authorities, have been without work for over a year. 1. In view of the foregoing, will the Commission state whether it is aware of the crisis affecting the Franzoni group and the risk of 160 employees being laid off under the ‘mobility procedure’? 2. Does the Commission intend to draw on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to help workers to retrain and find new employment?
