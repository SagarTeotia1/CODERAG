WRITTEN QUESTION E-3959/07 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Council (1 August 2007) Subject: Leonard Peltier case In December 1994 and again in February 1999, the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling for clemency for Leonard Peltier. Amnesty International has repeatedly expressed its concern about the fairness of the trial which led to Mr Peltier’s conviction in 1977 and has called for his release. International legal rules provide for minimum standards such as the rule that no one shall be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, while a number of Member States have acted on an individual basis on behalf of Mr Peltier. Could the Council indicate whether the Leonard Peltier case has ever been discussed at Council level and outline its policy on the case? Will the Council now raise this matter with the US authorities?
