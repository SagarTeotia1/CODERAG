Question for written answer E-010057/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (7 December 2010) Subject: Afghan refugee A few days ago, the ‘Ciutadans Anònims de la Roda de la Pau de Sabadell’ platform condemned the situation of a young Afghan resident in Sabadell, Spain. Ismail J, of the Hazara ethnic group, is a victim of institutional violence in Europe, having spent the past five years travelling through various European countries seeking political asylum, which no country has yet deigned to grant him. He is a victim of the war in Afghanistan and is scared to return to his homeland, since the ethnic group to which he belongs is being mercilessly persecuted by the Taliban. Despite the fact that Sabadell Council unanimously passed a motion to regularise Ismail J's status in Spain, based on the Geneva Convention at the time, this is not enough to guarantee that he will not be deported back to Greece. According to various United Nations reports, Greece does not comply with international treaties on political asylum and deportations to Greece are therefore not recommended. This view is endorsed by the European Court of Human Rights. Meanwhile, Ismail J's family remains in a mountainous conflict zone in Afghanistan and his own physical and mental state is constantly worsening. In this context it is absolutely essential that asylum be guaranteed for both Ismail J and his family, based on the Geneva Convention. In view of the fact that Spain and other Member States are conducting humanitarian missions in Afghanistan, should Ismail J not be granted political asylum, given his situation? Does the Commission not believe that Ismail J fulfils all the criteria necessary to be granted political asylum under the Geneva Convention? Does the Commission not believe that it would be a terrible mistake to deport Ismail J back to Greece, given that the ECHR and the UN advise against this?
