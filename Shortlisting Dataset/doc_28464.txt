Question for written answer E-9624/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE) (23 November 2010) Subject: Supplying of Romanian pork meat in the EU The Romanian authorities have announced that, with a view to the issuing of a positive opinion on a resumption in the supplying of pork meat in the EU, the Commission has requested that they perform a ‘regional compartmentalisation’, which would make it easier to monitor any outbreak of a swine fever epidemic. At the same time, the authorities claim that the EU‑level legislation needed to implement this type of measure does not exist. Can the Commission state: 1. whether the request referred to by the Romanian authorities has been issued formally; 2. what legislative framework regulates the implementation of ‘regional compartmentalisation’?
