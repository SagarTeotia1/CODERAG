Will the Commission indicate whether any legislation exists which prevents one Member State from providing state aid for the industry of another? 2.

If so has it received clearance from the Commission? 3. Will the Commission investigate an infringement of the treaties and of EU legislation by a Member State with regard to the £7.2 million annual subsidy provided by the UK Government for the provision of navigational aids in the Republic of Ireland?
