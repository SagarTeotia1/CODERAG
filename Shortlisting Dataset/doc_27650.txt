WRITTEN QUESTION E-0943/09 by Koenraad Dillen (NI) to the Commission (20 February 2009) Subject: Expenditure in Belgium in 2007 in the budgetary field of citizenship The Commission's budget for 2007 included a Heading 3b, citizenship, to which EUR 801 million was allocated. EUR 90 million of this was apparently spent in Belgium, but evidently no one knows what it was spent on… When the Flemish Government is asked how these funds were distributed, it replies that the money comes from the Commission's budget and that it is therefore up to the Commission to provide details of beneficiaries (both individuals and projects). It would therefore be unacceptable for the Commission to claim that it is the Member States that should provide details, even though they may either select the beneficiaries or at least have a hand in their selection, as they flatly refuse to provide this information. In what publication or on what website can a list be found of all the beneficiaries of the EUR 63.5 million which was apparently spent in the sub-field of health and consumer protection, the EUR 196.6 million which was apparently spent in the sub-field of the European Solidarity Fund, the EUR 23 million which was apparently spent in the sub-field ‘Citizens for Europe’, of all the beneficiaries of the EUR 85.1 million apparently spent in the sub-field ‘Communication’, of all the beneficiaries of the EUR 44.2 million apparently spent in the sub-field ‘Culture’, of all the beneficiaries of the EUR 116.8 million apparently spent in the sub-field ‘Youth in action’, and of all the beneficiaries of the EUR 103.2 million apparently spent in various other sections of the ‘citizenship’ budget? If this publication or website does not exist (or does not yet exist), please supply a copy of such a list on CD-ROM. I should also like to receive addresses so that it is possible to ascertain which are in Belgium.
