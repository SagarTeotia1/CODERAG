Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (15 July 2011) On 2 July 2008, the Commission issued a proposal for an Equal Treatment Directive Proposal for a Council directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, COM(2008)426 final. that aims to extend the protection against discrimination, including on the grounds of disability, beyond employment. The Council is currently examining this proposal. In addition to this proposal in the field of non-discrimination (based on Art. 19 TFEU) the Commission is engaged in preparations for a European Accessibility Act to be proposed in 2012. The purpose of the Act will be to remove existing barriers for persons with disabilities when accessing goods and services. The Employment Equality Directive Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p.16‑22. which prohibits disability discrimination in employment matters has been implemented in all Member States. Many of the infringement procedures that the Commission had launched to ensure effective enforcement of the rights in the directives have in the meantime been closed, as Member States have ensured full compliance with the directive's provisions. On 6 April 2011, the Commission decided to refer Italy to the EU's Court of Justice for incorrect transposition of Article 5 of the directive, as Italian law does not provide for a general rule whereby the employer has to provide for reasonable accommodation for all disabled persons and regarding all aspects of employment. The respect of the rights in the UN Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) is the joint responsibility of the Member States and the EU, within their respective area of competence. The European Union formally confirmed the UNCRPD on the 23 December 2010 Council Decision 2010/48/EC concerning the conclusion by the European Community, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, OJ L 23, 27.1.2010, p. 35. , and it will implement the UNCRPD within areas of its competence, as those are outlined in the Appendix to Decision 2010/48/EC. The European disability strategy, adopted by the European Commission on 15 November 2010 European disability strategy 2010-20: A renewed commitment to a barrier-free Europe, communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2010)636 final. , aims at ensuring the effective implementation of the UNCRPD across the EU and eliminating barriers so people with disabilities can enjoy their full rights. The strategy and its accompanying Staff Working Paper Commission Staff Working Document: Initial plan to implement the European disability strategy list of actions 2010‑15, SEC(2010)1324. list a number of concrete actions to support the Member States in their efforts to improve the social and economic situation of people with disabilities, for the period 2010‑15. Moreover, in the strategy for the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the European Union COM(2010)573 final. the Commission has explained that it would ensure that the EU’s
