9999/C Q999 E/021 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3654/03 by Ioannis Marinos (PPE-DE) to the Council (01 December 2003) Subject: Counterfeiting of euro notes and coins Information is now coming to light that forged euro notes are being detected with great frequency in Eurozone countries. In Greece, in fact, even counterfeit €2 coins have been detected, while the same source alleges that there is a factory producing forged euro notes in Bulgaria and another producing counterfeit coins in Turkey. Eurobarometer's report No 58 sets out the results of a survey demonstrating that a large number of Eurozone citizens still feel psychologically attached to their former national currencies, while the euro is also seen as responsible for prices being rounded up. The European Central Bank has announced that it has formed, in partnership with the major banknote issuing authorities, the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG). Does the Council consider that the general preparation for the euro's introduction was adequate, and that measures to prevent forgery were taken early enough?
