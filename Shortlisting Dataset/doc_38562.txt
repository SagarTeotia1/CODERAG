Question for written answer E-007522/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Bas Eickhout (Verts/ALE) (29 July 2011) Subject: EBRD loan for Kolubara mining complex in Serbia The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and German development Bank KfW are considering providing loans worth EUR 140 million for the development of a new field in the open pit lignite mine in the Kolubara mining complex in Serbia http://www.ebrd.com/pages/project/eia/41923.shtml . This investment may strengthen the already dominant market position of the state-owned Serbian Electricity Company (EPS) and deepen the country's dependency on lignite — the dirtiest of fossil fuels. This mine development programme is clearly linked to construction of new coal-fired power plants. EPS plans three new units in Kolubara complex to receive coal from this mine. These plans are driven by demand for electricity exports, as is illustrated by reports of participation by the Italian company Edison http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/06/22/serbia-a-e1-5bn-italian-power-plant-with-enviromental-costs/#axzz1SAJ6AheK — a carbon leakage scheme that should not be supported with public money by the EBRD. Moreover, the EPS company is being officially investigated for corruption http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/investigation-at-kolubara & http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=02&dd=02&nav_id=72487 and is violating the rights of communities affected by its operations by forced resettlement to new locations that were not accepted by people due to lack of adequate living conditions equal to the present ones. Considering Serbia's obligations under the Energy Community Treaty and the pre-accession process: 1. What does the Commission think of this investment decision concerning the Kolubara mining complex in Serbia? Does the Commission think that this will lock Serbia into fossil fuel dependency, which is not in agreement with the overall EU objective of decarbonisation of the energy sector? 2. Is the Commission satisfied with Serbia's conduct with regard to regulation of resettlements and respect for human rights? 3. Was the Commission consulted about the EBRD loan for the Kolubara project and what is its position on it? Is the Commission of the opinion that the EBRD loan is in accordance with the EU's 2020 objectives for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth?
