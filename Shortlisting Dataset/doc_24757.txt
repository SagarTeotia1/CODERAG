WRITTEN QUESTION E-0409/05 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (10 February 2005) Subject: EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive Directive 91/271/EEC OJ L 135, 30.5.1991, p. 40 . requires Member States to ensure that sewage and other waste water from all conurbations with a population of over 15000 undergoes secondary-level (biological) treatment before being discharged into rivers and other water bodies. The treatment plants required to achieve this should have been operational by 31 December 2000. However, in the United Kingdom, this is still not the case for 14 conurbations, including Lerwick in the Shetlands Islands, Scotland. Following the decision by the Commission of 12 January 2005 to issue a final written warning to the United Kingdom Government for persistently failing to implement the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, what discussions has the Commission had with the United Kingdom Government about its continued failure to implement Directive 91/271/EEC?
