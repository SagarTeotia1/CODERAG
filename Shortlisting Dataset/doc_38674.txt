Question for written answer E-008887/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (7 October 2011) Subject: European regional development funds for the Basilicata region On 7 April 2011 the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn, spoke at a conference in Bari (Italy) to illustrate expenditure from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) by the regions of southern Italy. The Commissioner drew attention to the ever increasing risk that some European funds might be lost unless commitment and expenditure procedures are genuinely stepped up. With a view to obtaining more specific information on the decommitment risks and the measures that might be taken later this year, can the Commission say: 1. For what amount and for which programmes might the Basilicata region have its appropriations automatically cancelled (‘decommitted’) up to 31 December 2011? 2. What amount of commitments and payments have already been launched to date for each programming priority? 3. What corrective measures does the Commission suggest in order to attain the optimum level of spending by 31 December 2011? 4. Can it provide an analytical response along the lines of the one already provided by DG REGIO on 27 January 2010 (see attached text)?
