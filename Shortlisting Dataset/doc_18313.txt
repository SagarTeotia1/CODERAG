Question for written answer E-001209/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Vilija Blinkevičiūtė (S&D) (15 February 2011) Subject: Provision for oversight in the proposal for a directive on conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer On 13 July 2010 the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer. The directive is to apply to skilled workers. The proposal does not provide for any form of oversight, in other words it does not lay down penalties in cases where an employer violates workers’ rights or employs workers illegally. What would be the Commission’s attitude to provision for oversight and penalties in the abovementioned proposal for a directive?
