Question for written answer E-6850/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (30 August 2010) Subject: Inadequate passing-on of energy price reductions A study by the Austrian Energy Agency has shown that Austrian electricity and gas distributors do not always pass on price reductions to customers, or that they do so only after a delay. For example, between July 2008 and June 2009 electricity and gas wholesale prices fell by about a fifth, whereas customers were forced to accept a price rise of a good 5 %. The electricity industry argues that the electricity used by final consumers was purchased from the supplier over approximately the two previous years and that for this reason a ‘mixed price’ from that period was charged. It is worth recalling that the directive of 1996 (96/92/EC OJ L 27, 30.1.1997, p. 20. ) paved the way for liberalisation of the energy market. In Austria, however, barely 1 % of households changed their energy supplier. Experts assume that this is linked to the fact that many customers do not understand their electricity bills. 1. How has liberalisation affected the European Union's energy market, particularly energy prices? 2. At the time of liberalisation, were rules also adopted at EU level concerning passing on price reductions? 3. Is denial of access to networks still occurring? 4. Does the Commission know to what extent changes of supplier are occurring in Europe as a whole? 5. As part of the EU's consumer protection policy, are efforts being made to provide customers with more comprehensible electricity bills?
