Question for written answer E-7833/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Georgios Koumoutsakos (PPE) (30 September 2010) Subject: Mutual assistance clause and the measures necessary for its implementation The Lisbon Treaty has introduced a number of major innovations regarding the EU’s common foreign and security policy and the common security and defence Policy, for example the ‘mutual assistance clause’ (Article 42(7)) and the ‘solidarity clause’ (Article 222). Concerning the ‘solidarity clause’ the Treaty specifies that it is necessary to enact implementing measures (Article 222(3)). However, this does not apply to the ‘mutual assistance clause’. Here the Treaty simply states in general terms that ‘if a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter …’ (Article 42(7)). Given the fundamental importance of Article 42(7) of the Lisbon Treaty for the common security and defence policy and the Member States themselves: Will the Council urge the Commission, and in what way, to take the necessary action within its terms of reference?
