WRITTEN QUESTION E-3930/05 by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (ALDE) to the Commission (27 October 2005) Subject: Turkey On 3 October, the EU opened membership negotiations with Turkey. In this connection, I should be glad if the Commission would answer the following question: The Turkish teachers' association Egitim Sem has failed to gain approval under Turkish labour law and will therefore have to disband, because its rules lay down that everyone must have the right to be taught in his or her own mother tongue, including Kurdish. This is not permitted in Turkey, which is a violation of the rights of minorities. What is the Commission’s view of this case, and what action does it propose to take as a result of it?
