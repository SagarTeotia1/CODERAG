Question for written answer E-7618/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (28 September 2010) Subject: Expansion of casino complex in Parnitha National Park The Parnitha National Park is a Natura 2000 area coded GR 30000001. When it was designated a national park in 1961, special authorisation was given to allow certain existing facilities to continue to operate; these included the Hotel Mount Parnes located at the heart of the protected area. The hotel was subsequently converted into a casino and, in 2003, was leased to a private company under conditions which allow for substantial expansion, sanctioned by legislation which is contrary to the Greek Constitution. In 2007, much of the protected area was burned down in a forest fire. Immediately afterwards, 6.3 hectares of woodland around the grounds of the casino were exempted from reafforestation on the basis of the long-term leasing agreement between the Greek Government and the private company. Work has already begun on that site to set up ancillary infrastructure which could have been built within the hotel's grounds http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&id=194679 . A new, prefabricated wing — allegedly a temporary structure — was also added to the casino, which is almost the same size as the original building and houses permanent company operations. Civil society organisations consider these measures to be illegal and have challenged their legal basis in the Greek courts. Will the Commission answer the following questions? 1. Is it consistent with Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7. on the conservation of natural habitats to change the use of several hectares of land at the heart of a national park and assign them other purposes? 2. Does the Greek Government's agreement with the company running the casino take precedence over European legislation? 3. Is it legal under Directive 92/43/EEC to erect an additional casino building for permanent purposes at the heart of the protected area?
