Question for written answer E-009412/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (20 October 2011) Subject: Unnecessary treatment and operations drain resources for healthcare in the EU According to European Commission statements, unnecessary or badly performed operations on the ageing population in Europe are a fundamental healthcare issue for the EU. Published studies show that unnecessary surgical operations, which are however financially significant for doctors and hospitals, are conducted in the Member States. The statistics also show that up to 36 % of medicines prescribed for patients with an average age of 82 are unnecessary. This results in a drain on investment in innovation in healthcare and in harm to the health of patients. In the light of the unnecessary dispensing of drugs and performance of operations for economic reasons, what specific measures does the Commission intend to take to limit the artificially inflated budgets of hospitals? Is it planning, in connection with these measures, to place more emphasis on efforts to enhance prevention, in particular, which could prevent millions of early deaths?
