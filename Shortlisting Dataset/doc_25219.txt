WRITTEN QUESTION E-5645/08 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (17 October 2008) Subject: Rearing calves for the production of milk-fed Piedmontese veal The Region of Piedmont has recently implemented Community legislation on animal welfare which imposes a number of new requirements on livestock producers. In particular, provisions have been introduced to ensure that young calves are not tethered and have constant access to water to drink. Producers and experts in the sector assert that the new rules will create extremely serious problems for the production of traditional Piedmontese ‘vitello sanato’, veal from milk-fed castrated calves, which have been reared by the same methods for at least 200 years. If the young calves from which the veal is produced are allowed constant access to water, they tend to drink excessive amounts and fall sick. The legislation should not fail to take into account the possibility that it could result in the closing down of many small or medium-sized holdings which are unable to adapt their premises to the rules in question. This would place at risk the proper upkeep of the land, a task which is performed in very many districts by holdings of this kind, and thus have a damaging impact on the environment and burden the public authorities with additional costs. A question on this subject has already been tabled with the Piedmont Regional Council. In view of the foregoing, would the Commission state its position on the possibility of introducing measures to help small and medium-sized holdings producing Piedmontese milk-fed veal to make the necessary structural changes, by allowing and supporting conversion measures?
