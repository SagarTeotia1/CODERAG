Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (19 May 2011) The Commission followed the flotilla incident of 31 May 2010 and its fallout, including the implications for Turkish-Israeli relations. The EU condemned the use of violence that produced a high number of victims among the members of the flotilla and demanded an immediate, full and impartial inquiry into these events and the circumstances surrounding them. The United Nations' (UN) Human Rights Council and High-Level Panel have both been active, although the Panel has yet to rule. The position of the Quartet, which includes the EU, as expressed in June 2010, is that all those wishing to deliver goods should do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. According to the Quartet, there is no need for unnecessary confrontation, and all parties should act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza. This remains the EU position and the Commission follows developments in this regard very closely. The Commission unequivocally condemns the use of violence and inflammatory rhetoric and considers calls for the destruction of Israel particularly odious. In contrast, it supports dialogue, cooperation and good neighbourly relations in the Middle East region and elsewhere. This is the best way to ensure the region's stability, security and prosperity, for the benefit of all.
