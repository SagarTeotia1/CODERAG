Question for written answer E-000873/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (2 February 2012) Subject: NSRF (National Strategic Reference Framework) and private initiative According to an article in the newspaper To Proto Thema , it is generally accepted that Greece is seeking a return to economic growth. Unfortunately, the Greek Government does not possess the necessary funds, while private capital in the hands of Greek entrepreneurs and shipowners is located abroad because of the uncertain economic climate in Greece and the continuing danger of the country going bankrupt. At the same time, difficulties are arising concerning the take-up of NSRF funding, primarily because of bureaucratic obstacles and delays in approving investment. Moreover, the Greek Government is unable to make even the statutory 5 % contribution and so forfeits the remaining 95 % of the funding from Europe. In the article it is proposed that the German head of the Task Force in Greece, Mr Reichenbach, should point out to the EU and the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Olli Rehn that the 5 % government contribution could also be obtained from private investors for whom approved investment schemes with 95 % EU funding could prove an attractive proposition, thereby facilitating rapid economic recovery in Greece. In view of this: — What view does the Commission take of this proposal? — Can it be included among the institutional changes with which the Commission's Task Force for Greece concerns itself?
