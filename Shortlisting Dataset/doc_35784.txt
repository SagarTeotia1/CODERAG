Question for written answer E-012477/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (9 January 2012) Subject: Serbia-Kosovo border conflict Serbia has long been expressing its wish to become a member of the European Union. However, normalisation of relations with neighbouring countries is a fundamental condition laid down by Brussels for the accession of any Balkan country to the EU. Attempts have been made to settle the Serbia-Kosovo border conflict through an agreement creating joint, integrated, unilateral and secure checkpoints on the borders. Upon conclusion of this agreement, Serbia vowed to acquire the status of candidate country, but a spokesperson for the EULEX police mission in Kosovo has reported that the conclusion of the agreement has not changed the situation and that the Kosovo Serbs had not removed their barricades in the vicinity of the border crossings. The barricades are still where they were prior to the agreement. — Since the European Union is a mediator in Serbia-Kosovo negotiations and the agreement on Kosovo borders is clearly not fit for purpose, what else is the Commission proposing?
