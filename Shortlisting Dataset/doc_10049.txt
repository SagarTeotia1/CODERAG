WRITTEN QUESTION E-4127/06 by Thomas Wise (IND/DEM) to the Commission (29 September 2006) Subject: Public information The Commission has provided a public information telephone service, whereby members of the public can ask questions and get information about the European Union. The telephone number given (from the UK) is 0800 67891011. When several of my constituents from different towns asked ‘Is it possible for the UK to leave the EU?’ the response was always ‘NO’. However, successive UK Government Ministers have agreed that we could leave if the 1972 European Communities Act was repealed. (There is a protocol in UK Parliament that one government cannot control or bind one of its successors.) Thus it is apparent that someone is not being honest. Can the Commission please clarify this and confirm its opinion?
