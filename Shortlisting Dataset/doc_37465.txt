Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2010) The Commission is aware that a delegation of Members of the Lower Chamber of the Dutch Parliament recently cancelled a planned visit to Turkey. The reason put forward for the cancellation was the statement by a Turkish Government spokesperson as regards one member of the delegation, i.e. Mr Geert Wilders, Member of the Lower Chamber of the Dutch Parliament, and his political ideas. On the basis of this statement the delegation concluded that they would not be received by the Turkish Government. Subsequently, the Chairman of the EU Harmonisation Committee of the Grand Turkish National Assembly declared that the Turkish parliamentarians regretted the cancellation of the visit. The Commission is not aware that Turkey intended to refuse Members of the Dutch Parliament access either to its territory or to its government premises. The Commission does not see any link between the said cancellation and the accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey.
