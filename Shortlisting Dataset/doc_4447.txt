decisions. The Commission seems to refer to Article 10 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, according to which “the financial perspective does not take into account of budget items financed by earmarked revenue within the meaning of Article 4 of the Financial Regulation”. Interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, OJ C 172 of 18.6.1999. In the framework proposal, the Parliament is merely consulted about the financial and technical guidelines concerning the research programme. Its only real power relates to Article 4, paragraph 3 of the Financial Regulation, which requires prior authorisation from the Parliament and Council before the Commission can accept donations that involve financial charges to the general budget. Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, as amended in Council Regulation No 2673/1999 of 13 December 1999, OJ L 326 of 18.12.1999. The rapporteur believes that this power should be used in full to correct some of the problems in the current proposals. The main problem concerns the fact that the Parliament would have no say over the activities and guidelines of the future Coal and Steel Research Fund despite the fact that the administrative expenditure of the Fund would have to be met from the general budget. As a result, the Parliament as one arm of the budgetary authority would have to adopt this expenditure (estimated at € 8.4 million in 2003) without having any influence on the activities of the Fund. The rapporteur believes that the Parliament should not accept such a passive role which - as the Chairman of the Committee on Industry and Research rightly puts it - is a relic from the pre-democratic era of European integration. Clearly, the Fund should fall under legislative and budgetary co-decision as is the case with similar activities financed under the RTD framework programme. It would seem odd to apply Articles 275 and 276 of the EC Treaty, which concern the Parliament's powers of discharge, if at the same time it does not have the right to decide on the use of appropriations in the Research Fund. Therefore, the Parliament's first request should be to ask for full budgetisation of the interest of the Research Fund, which would require specific headings in the revenue and expenditure part of the general budget. The revenue should cover all expenditure of the Research Fund, including its administrative costs. This would ensure the visibility, transparency and specificity as well as the budgetary neutrality of the Fund (see table below).
