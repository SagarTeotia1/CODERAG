ORAL QUESTION H-0286/07 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Baroness Sarah Ludford to the Commission Subject: Commissioners' Group on fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities In the written answer to oral parliamentary question ( H-1020/05 ) by Sophie In't Veld (MEP) in December 2005, the Commission described the activities of the Commissioners' Group on fundamental rights, anti-discrimination and equal opportunities since its inception. Can the Commission now give an update by outlining the main activities of the group in 2006? Regarding the Commission’s role under article 7 TEU, the Commission said that it 'intends to exercise these powers in full and with a clear awareness of its responsibility. Should a case………emerge which would require a political assessment by the Commission in the light of Article 7 of the EU Treaty, the possibility is not excluded that the Group might contribute in preparing that assessment through discussions'. Has the group of Commissioners on fundamental rights done a political or legal Article 7 assessment on the issue of CIA ‘extraordinary rendition’, not least in the light of the conclusions of the European Parliament temporary committee report and in particular paragraph 228? If not, why not? What action do the group and the Commission as a whole intend to take on this matter?
