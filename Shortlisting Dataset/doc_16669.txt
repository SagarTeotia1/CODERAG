Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (8 February 2007) In its meetings with the Israeli authorities, the Commission reminds them of their obligations under the agreement on movement and access of 15 November 2005 between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. This document contains provisions for the facilitation of movement of people and goods within the West Bank ‘to minimise disruption to Palestinian lives’. The Commission furthermore acts in full accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of 14 and 15 December 2006 which call for the ‘full and speedy implementation of the agreement on movement and access’. Palestinian President Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, at their recent meeting, agreed on a number of confidence-building measures, and both sides made some commitments. Prime Minister Olmert undertook to dismantle some of the check points in the West Bank and instructed Minister of Defence Peretz to draft a plan for a further reduction of closures in the West Bank. The Commission will follow developments with regard to these commitments closely.
