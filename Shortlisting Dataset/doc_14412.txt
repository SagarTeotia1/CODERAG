Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (16 April 2010) Exposures to cosmic radiation in high altitudes are indeed within the scope of Directive 96/29/Euratom Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation, OJ L 159, 29.6.1996. on the basis of Article 2.2. Title VII, Article 40 paragraph 2 of the directive does address work activities which may be of concern, and mentions under (d) explicitly aircraft operation. At the time of drafting Directive 96/29/Euratom, consideration was given to the exposure of passengers to cosmic radiation while travelling by air, as the exposure of frequent flyers who are employees travelling for their job can in extreme cases indeed reach levels which cannot be disregarded from radiation protection point of view. While it is relatively straightforward for an airline company to keep a record of the flights and the related exposure of each aircrew member, it is much more difficult for an employer of frequently flying staff to receive the exact flight data of all the flights, in particular when using different airline companies, and calculate the annual exposures for each individual employee, using these flight data. The Commission, therefore, considers the control of exposures of frequent flyers as not feasible in practice and does not intend to introduce specific provisions for the control of these exposures. Nevertheless, Member States' competent authorities may decide to regulate specific situations.
