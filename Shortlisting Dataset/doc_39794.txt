The MIC also established, with the support of the EC Joint Research Centre (JRC), a monitoring and alert tool (MIC Daily) in August 2005, which covers available early warning and alert information in a comprehensive way. It is updated on a daily basis and disseminated to civil protection authorities in the 30 countries participating in the Community civil protection mechanism. The Commission continues refining its internal strategy to further improve its early warning capacity. It is currently preparing a call for tender on civil protection simulation exercises, which will focus on early warning elements for tsunamis and similar disasters in the Mediterranean and Atlantic as one priority for the exercise scenarios. For the period 2000‑06, the Structural Funds, through the Community support framework and in particular its regional operational programme for Attiki, have taken into account the restoration of public infrastructures damages caused by the Athens earthquake from 7 September 1999. An amount of EUR 357.31 million representing 22,7 % of the public expenditure of the regional operational programme for Attiki has been reserved for this action while the foreseen Community support represents about EUR 285.86 million (80 % of the corresponding public expenditure). At this stage, a total amount of EUR 195.4 million, 68 % of the Community contribution for this action, has been used by the programme while the managing authority has already approved 100 % of the foreseen public expenditure.
