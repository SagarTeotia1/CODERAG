Answer given by Mr Kinnock on behalf of the Commission (29 September 2003) At the regularly organised welcome meetings for new colleagues, the Adminfo service (which is responsible for both the reception of and provision of information to new officials), explains both orally and in its brochure Welcome to the Commission the different aspects related inter alia to settling in various locations around Brussels, the existence of three official languages in Belgium and of Dutch-speaking, French-speaking and bilingual areas. Article 20 of the Commission's Staff Regulations provides that an official shall reside either in the place where he is employed or at no greater distance therefrom as is compatible with the proper performance of his duties . Within the bounds of this Regulation, the selection of a place to live is of course a matter of individual choice. In any event, the Commission has neither the wish, the powers nor the budget to give officials incentives to settle in particular areas. The Honourable Member will be aware that for most officials of the Commission choosing to live in the outskirts of Brussels, neither Dutch nor French is their first language.
