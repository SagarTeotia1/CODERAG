Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (13 February 2012) The Commission has in developing its proposals for Horizon 2020 taken great care in ensuring that maximum impact will be obtained from Union funding for research and innovation, in terms of creating growth and jobs and addressing citizens' concerns. While this does include a new focus on supporting activities which are closer to the market, the proposals also explicitly acknowledge the important role played by basic research in providing the knowledge and breakthroughs needed to feed into subsequent innovation. The proposal for Horizon 2020 therefore contains a dedicated priority on ‘Excellent science’, focusing inter alia on frontier research, with funding of nearly EUR 25 billion, which will support Europe's science base in developing world class excellence in research. This includes a substantial increase in the budget of the European Research Council, which has proven to be very successful. The social sciences and humanities will be integrated across the three priorities of Horizon 2020. They will be included as an integral part of all societal challenges, working beyond the ‘silos’ of distinct disciplines. In addition, the ‘Inclusive, Innovative and Secure Societies’ challenge will allow the study of issues such as smart and sustainable growth, social transformations in European societies, social innovation and creativity, the position of Europe as a global actor as well as the social dimension of a secure society. Finally, there will be ample bottom-up opportunities for social sciences and humanities researchers to receive funding via the European Research Council, Marie Curie actions and initiatives under the Research Infrastructures Programme.
