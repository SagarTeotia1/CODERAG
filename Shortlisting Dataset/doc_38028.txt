regulated by an interinstitutional agreement; if the Commission assumes that co-regulation 'should not be used in situations where rules need to apply in a uniform way in every Member State' then its scope of application is unlikely to be very wide; in no circumstances however should it be allowed to result in a situation in which targets for industry for the purposes of environmental protection are fixed in a way that circumvents Parliament and merely approved by the Council under agreements between the Commission and trade associations which are neither ‘representative’ nor ‘accountable’; 36. Has fewer reservations about the open method of coordination if it is confined to the exchange of procedures that have proved their worth and the comparison of progress achieved and does not apply in the sphere of preparation of European Council meetings from which Parliament is excluded; it must under no circumstances lead to hidden parallel legislation by circumventing the legislative procedures established in the EC Treaty; 37. Points out that better law-making must become part of public administration 'culture' at all levels in the European Union, and must also encompass the implementation of laws and rules by Member State authorities; this will require effective and appropriate information and training of officials, both at European level and at national, regional and local levels, in order to guarantee decentralised administration and 'Europe-friendly conduct' at all levels; 38. Considers that any amendment to Community legislative provisions relating to the institutional and legal aspects of governance must be made by means of amending the Treaties in force and hence be placed on the agenda for the next Convention; 39. Calls on the Commission, in order to ' give priority to consideration of any infringements of Community law ' – as it has expressed the intention of doing – not to hesitate to initiate measures possibly leading to proceedings for non-compliance before the Court of Justice of the European Community against Member States under Article 226 of the Treaty; 40. Urges the Commission to intensify its efforts to complete its own administrative reform so as to establish a first-class, open and transparent public administration, without which it will be impossible to aspire to being the principal executive in a well-managed and accountable Union; Cooperation with the European Parliament 41. Expects the Commission to intensify cooperation in particular with Members of the European Parliament and to support them in what is the most fundamental of their tasks, in maintaining a dialogue with the citizens, the relevant Commission departments making available all the information needed for this purpose, e.g. on progress with administrative procedures and upcoming deadlines, and in particular providing full and detailed information upon request; Enlargement 42. Notes that the political dimension of enlargement is scarcely mentioned in the White Paper despite the fact that in its opinion on the convening of the last Intergovernmental Conference the Commission rightly pointed out that 'enlargement requires changes in the way in which the institutions operate to ensure their effectiveness in a Union whose membership is set to double' Adapting the institutions to make a
