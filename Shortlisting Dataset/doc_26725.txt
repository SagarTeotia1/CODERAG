the total European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) allocation to housing expenditure in favour of marginalised communities, which will take effect in the course of 2010, or the existing possibilities under the European Social Fund, E. whereas Council Directive 2000/43/EC has not been adequately transposed or fully implemented by all the Member States, F. whereas the European Union has committed itself several times to actively promoting the principles of equal opportunities and social inclusion with regard to the Roma population across Europe, G. whereas the past year has seen a significant increase in anti-Gypsyism in the mass media and in political discourse in some EU Member States and an increasing incidence of racially motivated violence against Roma, H. whereas progress in combating discrimination against Roma by guaranteeing their rights to education, employment, health and housing in both Member States and candidate countries has been uneven and slow, I. whereas special attention should be paid to those who are facing multiple discriminations, J. whereas Roma representation in governmental structures and the public administration in Member States should be increased, 1. Condemns the recent rise of anti-Gypsyism (Romaphobia) in several EU Member States, in the form of regular instances of hate speech and anti-Roma attacks; 2. Considers that fighting discrimination against Roma, who constitute a pan-European community, requires a comprehensive approach at European level; 3. Expresses its concerns at the discrimination suffered by Roma in education (particularly segregation), housing (particularly forced evictions and sub-standard living conditions, often in ghettos), employment (their particularly low employment rate) and equal access to healthcare systems and other public services, as well as the astoundingly low level of their political participation; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that equal opportunity provisions are strictly complied with when the Operational Programmes are implemented, so that projects do not directly or indirectly consolidate the segregation and exclusion of Roma; stresses that on 10 February 2010 it adopted a report on the eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities, which makes provision for housing interventions on behalf of vulnerable groups within the ERDF framework, and calls for rapid implementation of the revised regulation so that the Member States can make active use of this opportunity; considers, in this context, that housing is a precondition for ensuring effective social inclusion; calls on the Commission to ensure that the recently adopted Microfinance Facility is accessible to the Roma in order to support their integration into the labour market; 4. Recognises that the issues of full citizenship for and socio-economic participation by Roma are conditioned by a history of discrimination and social stigma; considers that a mainstreaming approach to Roma inclusion needs to be complemented by proactive measures to overcome past and present discrimination; calls on the Commission to pay due attention to this aspect in its approach to Roma inclusion; 5. Considers that the EU and the Member States share a responsibility to promote the inclusion of Roma and uphold their fundamental rights as European citizens and urgently need to step up their efforts to achieve visible results in this
