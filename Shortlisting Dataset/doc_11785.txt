of ensuring that any short-term measures taken by Member States to recover the economy contribute towards achieving the commonly agreed objectives; 2. Notes as a central dilemma in the current crisis that European economic policy instruments are not yet developed enough to successfully meet the challenges ahead; requires, therefore, a review and an update of the essential policy tools, in particular the Integrated Guidelines, the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as the Sustainable Development Strategy, in order to integrate them under the umbrella of a New Deal for Smart Growth in the European Union; 3. Stresses the necessity to refocus the Integrated Guidelines against the background of the economic downturn and urges the Council to agree on short-term measures to safeguard the 2008 employment rate and to invest in the fight against climate change, and to call on the Member States and the social partners, in accordance with national practice, to ensure sufficient incomes with special regard to the most vulnerable groups of society; expects the Commission to launch initiatives and present proposals with respect to these goals in time for the forthcoming Spring European Council; 4. Recalls that education, qualification and training are the best employment policy measures, and that childcare infrastructure is to be regarded as one of the preconditions for increasing participation, particularly by women in the labour market; encourages the Member States to mainstream these common principles in consultation with the social partners regarding their national reform programmes; Employment Guidelines 2008-2010: urgent need for a rigorous implementation 5. Reiterates the importance of using the flexicurity concept in guideline 20 to create a bridge between employments, and emphasises that this demands a high level of protection in the social security schemes as well as active labour market policies; 6. Welcomes in this regard the Commission's statement that it is essential to reinforce activation schemes, in particular for the low-skilled; enhance job subsidies and short training courses for vulnerable groups and those most at risk of long-term unemployment; provide (re)training and new skills needed in less badly affected sectors; ensure adequate social protection that provides income security, as well as make a crucial commitment to the social dialogue and the involvement of the social partners; 7. Underlines the importance of targeted actions for vulnerable groups in times of high unemployment, and in particular of targeted actions for groups of long-term unemployed, people with disabilities and immigrant groups; 8. Believes that, in view of the severity of the economic crisis, the Commission must be prepared to take exceptional measures, including a widening of access to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which must be able to support workers in a wider range of situations, including temporary workers who have lost their jobs, and a temporary opening of the European Social Fund to support employment preservation measures via training schemes; 9. Believes that the economic crisis requires the strengthening of EU measures to deal with restructuring, in particular the strengthening of information and consultation rights; 10. Believes that the next reform of the EU Structural Funds should focus their objectives more closely on
