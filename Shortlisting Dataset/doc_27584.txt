Question for written answer E-010812/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 John Stuart Agnew (EFD) (20 December 2010) Subject: Herbs: a new framework The inappropriate nature of the requirements of The Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive (THMPD) (EC Directive 2004/24/EC) for holistic traditions, such as those associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, Unani and Tibetan medicine, was recognised by the European Commission in its 2008 experience report for the THMPD (COM(2008)0584). The report states: ‘… independently of this report, the suitability of a separate legal framework for products of certain traditions should be assessed’. Given that food and medicine law regimes are distinct, is it the case that the existing sales of food supplement products associated with these traditions will cease to be legal after the end of the transition phase of the THMPD on 30 April 2011? Does the Commission have any plans to develop and legislate for an appropriate new light‑touch regime or is it content to see the disappearance from the EU, legally at least, of these ancient holistic traditions?
