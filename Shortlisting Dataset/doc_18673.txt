Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2007) In order to ensure that all Member States are represented in the design, the European Council decided in June 2005 to modify the common sides of euro coins. Furthermore, the Council wanted to take this decision on a timely basis in order to be certain that Member States adopting the euro would also be able to mint euro coins with the new common sides. Finally, it should be stressed that the design of the new common sides of euro coins should not be seen as a geographical map but as a stylistic representation of the EU.
