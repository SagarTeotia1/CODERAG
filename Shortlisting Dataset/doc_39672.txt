Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2006) Concerning research, in the fourth research framework programme (FP4), the Commission has funded, for around EUR 1.7 million, the two Prenlab projects on earthquake prediction research in the natural laboratory, Iceland. In FP5, two more projects were supported by funding of around EUR 2.5 million: the Prepared project — Application of experience to develop technology for improving preparedness and mitigating risk, representing a follow up of the previous work developed in Prenlab and the Smsites project — Developing stress-monitoring sites and infrastructure for forecasting earthquake. On the specific work done in Greece by Professor Papazachos, the Commission generally refrains from commenting on the scientific merit of particular research studies, the scientific community being the appropriate forum for questioning and debating research results and their potential applications.
