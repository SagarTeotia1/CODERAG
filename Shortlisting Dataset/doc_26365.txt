WRITTEN QUESTION E-3089/08 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (2 June 2008) Subject: Protection of Roma children What will the Commission do with regard to protecting Roma children, many of whom — as the press, the police authorities and other sources inform us — are exploited, enslaved and constantly have their human rights and rights as children violated? Will it take action on failure to comply with compulsory schooling requirements? How will it safeguard recognition of parental responsibilities? How will it ensure that there are no doubts as to the identity of minors and thus enforce respect for their rights?
