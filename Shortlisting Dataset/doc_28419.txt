9999/C Q999 E/020 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0418/04 by Gerhard Schmid (PSE) to the Commission (05 February 2004) Subject: Security of EC cards Fraud involving cash dispensers in the EU is on the increase. There have been a number of cases recently where data from EC cards has been transmitted from a cash dispenser set up specially for this purpose and copied onto new cards. Only German EC cards contain extra built-in security features preventing this kind of abuse. The replacement of magnetic strip cards with chip cards will take some time to complete. Is the Commission planning to draw up measures to introduce such security features throughout the internal market?
