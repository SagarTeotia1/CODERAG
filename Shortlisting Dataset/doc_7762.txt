EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/94 of 20 June 1994 on the conservation, characterisation, collection and utilisation of genetic resources in agriculture can be traced back to a host of resolutions and repeated demands by Parliament. Since the end of the 1980s, Parliament has pointed to the risks of genetic erosion in Europe and the world, at the same time highlighting the potential, in terms of the Community's rural development, afforded by the wide variety of useful plants and regionally adapted farm animal breeds. The Community programme on the conservation of genetic diversity in agriculture, based on Regulation 1467/1994, ended on 31 December 1999. Since then, the Council and Parliament have been calling for the coordinating and assistance measures to be adapted and extended. The Commission proposed a new programme in March 2001, but withdrew the proposal because both Parliament and the Council were opposed to the financing of national measures under the EAGGF Guarantee Section and wanted a more active role for the Commission in coordinating and implementing the new programme. The Commission is called on to make the Community programme and the work programme, which is still pending, fit in with long-term Community strategies on biodiversity conservation, sustainable agriculture and rural development beyond what is initially a limited period from 2004 to 2006. In doing so it will simply be meeting the Community's commitments under the relevant international United Nations treaties (Convention on Biological Diversity, Rio 1992 and the FAO Global Plan of Action) and, in the long term, should support and coordinate necessary actions in the current and, above all, new Member States. That includes not only government-assisted programmes and projects, but also the many networks of non-governmental organisations which play an important role in both the conservation and better use
