Reply (20 September 2010) The General Secretariat of the Council (GSC) organises teambuilding seminars for departments that need this type of training. The Honourable Member will find details of the cost of these seminars attached. All the seminars took place in Belgium, the Member State in which the Council is located. Information on the towns and cities in which the seminars were held is attached. The seminars lasted one day, in exceptional cases two. The names of the hotels is confidential information affecting the commercial interests of the businesses concerned; they were communicated to the Honourable Member by letter. These seminars mainly comprised activities designed to get colleagues better acquainted so as to work together more effectively. Of the 39 seminars held since 2006, about ten involved group-cohesion activities lasting one or two hours, such as orienteering courses, Nordic walking and open-air group exercises. The Council can assure the Honourable Member that none of the seminars organised by the GSC involved activities such as sumo wrestling in inflatable sumo wrestler suits. These seminars are vocational training exercises organised at the request of the departments. There is therefore no reason to deduct the days from participants' annual leave. Participation is compulsory for those designated by the departments concerned. Only staff designated by the departments concerned can take part in these vocational seminars — that means exclusively GSC staff members.
