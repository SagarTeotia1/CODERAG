9999/C Q999 E/054 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1037/04 by Joachim Wuermeling (PPE-DE) to the Commission (24 March 2004) Subject: Food controls in the accession countries In the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2004 on the comprehensive monitoring report of the Commission on the state of preparedness for EU membership of the accession countries (P5_TA-PROV(2004)0180) and the Commission monitoring report of 5 November 2003 ( COM(2003) 675 final), significant shortcomings are identified in the food processing industry in the accession countries. The Czech Republic in particular has not yet been able to fully transpose the acquis communautaire with regard to standards for food processing establishments. In a speech to plenary on 10 March 2004, Commissioner Verheugen noted that 'food safety and the modernisation and inspection of food processing plants in the interests of public health' remain a problem in the accession countries. On 18 March 2004, Agriculture Commissioner Fischler also referred to major shortcomings in veterinary controls, food safety and hygiene standards in the accession countries. The monitoring report states that the Commission will make use of all the means it has at its disposal, if necessary before accession, in order to ensure safety. More specifically, in the event of a risk being posed to food safety, measures would be taken to suspend the sale or export of foodstuffs from the country in question. Does the Commission have any plans to impose export bans for the period after 1 May 2004 to ensure that foodstuffs which pose a risk do not enter the internal market?
