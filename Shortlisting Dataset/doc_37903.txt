Reply (28 April 2011) The Council has not taken a specific position on the over- or undervaluation of any currency, nor has it pursued detailed analysis of the differentiated effects on individual Member States of trade flow variations resulting from the exports of individual third countries. In line with Article 121(3) and (4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Council monitors economic developments in each of the Member States in the Union, as well as the consistency of economic policies with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, and regularly carries out an overall assessment. The President of the Council reports to the European Parliament on the results of the multilateral surveillance. The detailed rules for this multilateral surveillance are currently being revised, by both the Council and the European Parliament, in accordance with Article 121(6) of TFEU. G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (including those representing the US, China and the EU) agreed in October 2010 to move towards more market — driven exchange rate systems that reflect underlying economic fundamentals and to refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies, while they agreed at their most recent meeting on 19 February 2011 to take due consideration of exchange rates, fiscal, monetary and other policies, alongside other indicators, in order to focus on those persistently large imbalances which require policy action.
