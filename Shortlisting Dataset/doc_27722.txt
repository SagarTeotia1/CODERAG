WRITTEN QUESTION E-5359/08 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (6 October 2008) Subject: Community support for the Sousacamp group Not long ago, when I visited the parish of Madalena, in the municipality of Paredes, I learned that the mushroom factory built by the Sousacamp group, which employs about a hundred female workers, is failing to comply with the most basic labour rights. The workers say that they are pressured psychologically into working three or four extra hours a day, sometimes even at weekends, but are paid less than their due for doing so. In addition to this rampant exploitation, the women concerned, most of whom are in a precarious situation, are filmed at work and, because of fatigue, repeatedly fall victim to industrial accidents. 1. Has Community support been granted for any Sousacamp factory, be it on the abovementioned Paredes production site or in the Braga district, the Mirandela area, Vila Real, or any other part of Portugal? Will other forms of aid be provided? What are the amounts involved? 2. What are the conditions of eligibility for such Community support? Are guarantees in place regarding employment with rights?
