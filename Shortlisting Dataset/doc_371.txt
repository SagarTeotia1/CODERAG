Following its evaluation, the EMPL committee of the European Parliament gave its view on the mobilisation of the Fund, as expressed in the letter attached to the present report. The Joint Declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, adopted during the conciliation meeting on 17 July 2008, has confirmed the importance of ensuring a rapid procedure with due respect of the Interinstitutional Agreement for the adoption of decisions on the mobilisation of the Fund. ANNEX:LETTER OF THE COMMITTEE OF EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS ES/jm D(2010)59717 M. Alain Lamassoure President of the Committee on budgets ASP 13E158 Subject: Opinion on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the case EGF/2010/004 PL /Wielkopolskie Automotive (COM(2010)616 final) Dear Mr Lamassoure, The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) as well as its Working Group on the EGF examined the mobilisation of the EGF for the case EGF/2010/004 PL/Wielkopolskie Automotive and adopted the following opinion.
