not to policyholders). Secondly, the society assessed the losses suffered by policies without GARs as a result of the impact of GARs in connection with the Compromise Scheme (see below See IV.2. ). The losses addressed by the scheme, which did not however cover all non-GAR policyholders, amounted to £850 million. The Rectification Scheme See also IV.3. , which corrected past retirements to allow for GAR, amounting to £103 million, might also be taken into consideration. Total GAR related losses would be a maximum of around 5% of policy value, according to Mr THOMSON (H2; WE 47), equalling around £1.5 billion at the time. The Penrose report, however, concludes that over-bonusing was a significant cause for the financial weakness of ELAS, which required the cuts in policy values (WE 16) inter alia page 691. . Referring to the report by Lord Penrose, EMAG stated that the latter calculated the cost of excess bonuses actually paid away to departing policyholders during the 1990s at £1,800 million, to which it would be necessary to add the (un-quantified but substantial) total excess bonuses included in continuing policies in order to arrive at the total cost of over bonusing: " Whichever method is used, over-bonusing resulted in Equitable Life being at least £2 billion short of assets, representing about half of the policy value cut of 16th July 2001 " (WE-CONF 16). The view that declaring excess bonuses in the 1990s seriously weakened Equitable Life's finances and that the policy value cut on 16 July 2001 was intended to recoup such excess bonuses is strongly supported by evidence from accountant firms (WE-CONF 23 and WE-CONF 24) and a legal opinion of Mr BOSWOOD (WE 76): " Whereas the stock market falls since December 1999 might have accounted for around 5,6% of the 16% cut implemented, the remainder was due to, first, the need to recoup GAR costs ... and, second, the need to rebalance the With Profits Fund to bring assets in line with aggregate policy values ... The real cause of the insufficiency of assets was not the fall in equity markets but, rather the payment of excess bonuses during the 1990s ". Explaining how the need for the 16% cut of July 2001 had arisen, Mr SLATER highlighted in WE 34 Pages 3 and 4. how, over more than a decade, EL had not balanced its policy values with asset values, thus accumulating deficits each year from 1989 to 2000 (even very substantial deficits, such as 28% in 1990 and 20% in 1994). As a result of this " policy of declaring total bonuses in excess of actual investment performance encouraged hundreds of thousands of innocent new investors and the Society expanded hugely. Equitable Life's senior management clearly recognised the risks they were taking. On 27 June 2001 the new board of directors heard Chief Executive Charles Thomson’s view of the level of surplus he would have expected at the end of 1999. Thomson commented that at the beginning of 2000, the excess of policy values over the value of assets was approximately 3%,
