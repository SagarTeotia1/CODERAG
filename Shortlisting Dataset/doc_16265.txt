and basic education by 2009 should apply to all European development policy spending, including the EDF. MEPs in the committee deplore the Council’s decision of 11 April 2006 that the African Peace Facility should be financed by the EDF, since this takes funds away from development in order to use them for foreign policy purposes. They believe the peace facility should be regarded as a Common Foreign and Security Policy instrument and not a development tool. The report criticises the fact that the gender dimension has not been included in the 10th EDF as a specific area of action. The committee is also against any attempt to tie to the allocation of integrated regional programme funds to participation in an Economic Partnership Agreement. The EDF is the EU's main instrument for development cooperation with the ACP countries and the Community's overseas territories. The 10th fund, covering the period 2008-2103, has a budget of €22 682 million.

The hearing, held on 8 April, focused on two main issues: recognition of the crimes and reconciliation. It was organised in response to a request made by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 19 April 2007 for a hearing on “crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes as well as those who publicly condone, deny, grossly distort or trivialise them”. The Commission is planning to analyse the findings of the hearing and use them as input to a report to the Council. MEPs will be using Monday's debate to find out more. The JHA Council made its request because on the same day (19.4.2007) it had reached a political agreement on a framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia. The denial or trivialization of genocide and war crimes were not covered by this legislation. The question thus arose as to whether a separate EU legal instrument was needed to cover such issues and this month's hearing was intended to contribute to that discussion. At present, Parliament is only consulted on such legislation (it adopted its opinion on the framework decision on 29 November 2007) and unanimity is required in Council, which has yet to give its final approval to the decision.
