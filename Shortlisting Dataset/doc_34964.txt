Question for written answer E-009111/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (13 October 2011) Subject: Access to the courts for the victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict According to Amnesty International, a possible agreement in connection with strengthening the position of Palestine within the UN which was conditional on the victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not applying to the International Criminal Court would be tantamount to an offer of impunity for the perpetrators’ crimes under international law and would deprive victims of access to the courts and to subsequent reparations. What steps is the Commission taking on the basis of the common position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and taking account of the objectives concerning justice in Libya and Syria, in order to help the victims of the conflict in Gaza?
