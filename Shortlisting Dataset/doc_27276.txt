WRITTEN QUESTION E-1786/04 by Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Detention of Christians in Laos Is the Commission aware of the conviction and long-term imprisonment of 23 Laotian Christians following arrests made between 1998 - 2001? These include: From Luang Namtha - Chia Chia, Nai Sio, Su Chio, Lu Awn. From Phongsali Province - Mr. Phia Song. From Savannakhet Province - Mr. Khamphone, Mr. Khamdang, Mr. Khamthone, Mr. Khamkeung, Mr Ey Noy and Mr. Songkone. From Udomsay Province - Mr. Boon Chanh, Mr. Yot, Mr. Leu, Mr.Singkham, Mr. Chiaphet and Mr. Vadaa. From Vientiane Province - Mr. Somsi. Their crime was to be part of a Christian gathering and attending a Church. This indictment would appear to contravene international human rights conventions on the freedom to peacefully practice one's religion. Can the Commission investigate this situation and if it agrees with my version of events, appeal for their early release?
