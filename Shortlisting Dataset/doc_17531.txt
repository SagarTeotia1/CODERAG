call on the Commission to propose anti-violence measures and clauses in multilateral agreements, for example in the context of the WTO. Economic & Monetary Affairs No more cheap cigarettes in Corsica after 2009 John PURVIS (EPP-ED, Scotland) Report on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directives 92/79/EEC and 92/80/EEC, authorising France to prolong the application of lower rates of excise duty to tobacco products released for consumption in Corsica ( COM(2003) 186 – C5-0197/2003 – 2003/0075(CNS)) Doc.: A5-0322/2003 Procedure : Consultation Debate : 22.10.2003 Although John PURVIS (EPP-ED, Scotland) for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs welcomes the Commission proposal to end the derogation by which cigarettes sold in Corsica enjoy a lower excise duty than in mainland France by the end of 2009, he proposes a far more gradual phasing out of this derogation. In tabling a number of non-binding amendments, the rapporteur proposes to increase the minimum excise rate to at least 35% by the end of this year, something which the French authorities have already decided to do. This should be followed by raises by 3 percentage points per year, with a final increase of 4 percentage points. Directive 92/79/EEC provided for Member States to set a minimum overall excise duty of 57% of the retail price. However, a specific regime applied in Corsica permits the retail selling of cigarettes at a price equal to two-thirds of the retail price in mainland France. France has requested a further extension of this regime, in order to safeguard the sector employed in the production and distribution of tobacco products on the island. The Commission proposes to let the total excise duty rate stand at 35% until December 31, 2007. From January 1, 2008, this rate would be increased further to 44%. At the end of the exemption period, the rate would be aligned with that applied in continental France.
