Question for written answer E-005428/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jürgen Creutzmann (ALDE) (7 June 2011) Subject: Restrictions on freedom to provide services as a result of national derogations provided for in Directive 2005/36/EC Estate agents who offer their services in a Member State where special national rules apply to this profession may be barred from carrying out cross-border activities. In some cases, they may even be reported to the authorities and receive fines. Does the Commission intend to lift the above restriction on freedom to provide services? Does the Commission intend, within the context of the forthcoming review of the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, to lay down a standard for estate agents’ qualifications valid in all Member States?
