Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (12 May 2009) As regards the disbursement of the assistance, the Commission is not aware of any obstacles in implementing the aid. It would refer to Article 5(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 of 11 November 2002 Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund, OJ L 311, 14.11.2002. establishing the EU Solidarity Fund, which specifies that the responsibility for selecting individual operations and implementing the grant lies with the beneficiary State — in compliance with the terms of the regulation, the grant decision and the agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the beneficiary State for the implementation of the grant. The grant of EUR 89.7 million, which was paid to Greece on 29 September 2008, shall be used within a one-year period. It can be used retroactively and help refinance emergency operations undertaken from ‘day one’ of the disaster. As regards the use of the grant, the beneficiary State is required to send to the Commission an implementation report not later than six months after expiry of the one-year implementation period. The report shall contain a list of supported operations, classified by type of operation; the total amount of the expenditure actually incurred and disbursed and the corresponding amount of financing from the European Union Solidarity Fund allocated to the whole set of operations, as well as the the bodies responsible for implementing each operation. The report shall also detail the preventive measures introduced or proposed by the beneficiary State in order to limit damage and to avoid, to the extent possible, a recurrence of similar disasters. On closure of the assistance the beneficiary State is also required to present to the Commission a statement, drawn up by a person or service functionally independent of the body responsible for implementation, summarising the conclusions of the checks carried out and pronouncing on the validity of the expenditure declared and the legality and correctness of the operations concerned.
