Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (28 October 2005) Since multilateral textile quotas were lifted on 1 January 2005, the Commission closely monitored the evolution of textile imports from China. Pursuant to the special safeguard regime applicable to textile imports from China, the EU imposed newly negotiated quotas in June 2005 to alleviate the excessive flow of imports of several textile products from China, including trousers. To the extent that imports of textiles, in the circumstances described by the Honourable Member, may involve customs fraud, including possible false declarations of import quantities of products covered by the textile quotas negotiated with China, and so constitute fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community, Member States are obliged by Article 280, paragraph 2, of the EC Treaty, to take the same measures as they take to counter fraud affecting their own financial interests. The principal responsibility for the protection of the Community’s financial interests in such matters as fraudulent imports therefore lies with the Member States themselves, since they are best placed to identify specific irregularities or frauds. Within the Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) monitors relevant trade statistics for indications of possible fraud with financial consequences for the Community budget, using a number of specialised techniques including some developed in collaboration with the Joint Research Centre at Ispra. OLAF also conducts investigations where there are sufficiently serious suspicions of fraud and/or assists Member States in the conduct of such investigations. In addition, the Commission is ready to examine any complaint which would provide evidence of unfair trade practices, including dumping, affecting the trade in textile with China. Should sufficient evidence be contained in the complaint, the Commission would open an anti-dumping investigation which, in turn, if warranted, would lead to the imposition of corrective measures.
