WRITTEN QUESTION P-3065/06 by Alain Hutchinson (PSE) to the Commission (30 June 2006) Subject: Relocation of Sem-Suhner In April 2005, Sem-Suhner, an Alsatian company specialised in the manufacture of small electronic transformers, motherboards, coils and cabling and based in Schirmeck, in the Bas-Rhin Department, announced that it was relocating its activities to Romania. The company's chairman announced that the entire workforce would be expected to work in the group's external units in Romania, the Czech Republic, China and India. The Sem-Suhner company also made the extremely clumsy and unacceptable offer to redeploy the personnel made redundant in Alsace. The workers concerned were offered the possibility of continuing their work in Romania and at Romanian wage levels. According to information I have received from some sources, Sem-Suhner received European and/or national public aid for its activities in Schirmeck. The Commission can claim reimbursement of this aid under Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 1 . laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds. Moreover, in its resolution of 14 March 2006 on relocation in the context of regional development (T6-0077/2006), Parliament emphasised its attachment to the repayment of public aid in the event of relocation. Will the Commission state whether Sem-Suhner has received public aid for its plant in Alsace or its new European sites? Does it intend to claim repayment of this aid should recovery thereof be possible under existing rules?
