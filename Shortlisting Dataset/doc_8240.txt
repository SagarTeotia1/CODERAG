Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (2 April 2008) The Commission is following the situation in Kosovo very closely. As concerns Kosovo's declaration of 17 February 2008, the Commission has taken note of the explicit reference in this declaration to the principles of democracy and equality of all its citizens, the protection of minorities, cultural and religious heritage, and to international supervision and the clear reference to Kosovo's European perspective. The General Affairs Council on 18 February 2008 left it to Member States to decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo. The Commission is very concerned by the eruption of intermittent but deliberate violence in the North and the acts of intimidation directed at representatives of the Kosovo authorities, the EU missions and the international presence in particular, as well as by the challenges to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo authority. The Commission urges restraint by all Kosovo citizens and authorities in their reaction to the developments on the ground. The European Union has appealed to the Serb authorities at all levels for restraint and de-escalation.
