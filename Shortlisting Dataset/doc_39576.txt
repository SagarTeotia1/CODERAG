the collection of data that could also include personal data by service providers being data controllers, not only on their website, but also by means of information in the national, regional or local press or by any other appropriate means. Positive measures should be taken by the controllers to avoid capturing images of a sensitive nature, as well as those including intimate details not normally observable by a passer-by. Article 18 of the Data Protection Directive requires a notification by the controller or his representative of the processing to the competent data protection authority. Furthermore, as the controller is not established in the European Union, an appointment of a local representative established in the territory of a Member State in question is necessary. Furthermore, individuals should have an easily accessible way to object to the publication of personal data relating to them, in particular by means of user-friendly, interactive, real-time mechanisms (e.g. by right-clicking with the mouse on the image currently displayed). This right should already be applicable after pictures of a specific area have been taken and before the service is published on the Internet. With regard to Google's Street Map tool, currently, a number of national supervisory data protection authorities are examining its compliance with the national legislation implementing the Data Protection Directive. In this context, an obligation to delete or blur individual's personal data is also being considered.
