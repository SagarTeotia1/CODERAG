WRITTEN QUESTION E-7089/08 by Syed Kamall (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (13 January 2009) Subject: Italian TV Tax Legislation On 28 November, the Italian Government issued a Decree-Law allegedly aimed at providing a package of measures to counter the effects of the current global financial crisis. The law provides for an increase in the current reduced VAT rate applicable to pay-TV services from 10 % to 20 %. The Italian Government has publicly stated that it was required to take this measure by the Commission, in order to eliminate any distortion in the application of VAT rates. This move could have a substantial impact on the take-up of such services in Italy, particularly as a reduced VAT rate of 4 % will continue to apply to the licence fee for the state broadcaster RAI and all traditional press outlets — including the networks of Prime Minister Berlusconi’s Mediaset Network. Is the Commission aware of the impact this move is likely to have on competition and media pluralism in the Italian media market, given that Prime Minister Berlusconi’s Mediaset network will not fall under the 20 % category for the majority of services it offers? How does the apparent approval by the Commission of this VAT increase by the Italian Government tally with its supposed support for competition and media pluralism in Italy? During the debates on Audiovisual Media Services (AVMS) in 2006, Commissioner Reding stated that she believed in ‘technology neutrality’ in AVMS. How does the apparent approval by the Commission of this VAT increase by the Italian Government meet the goal of technology neutrality in AVMS?
