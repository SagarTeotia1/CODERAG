Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (13 June 2006) According to Article 28(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, OJ L 270, 21.10.2003. , the payments under the direct support schemes provided for in that regulation have to be made once a year at a date fixed by each Member State within the period from 1 December to 30 June of the following calendar year. The Member States must therefore organise the necessary controls and the subsequent payments in order to respect the conditions of Article 28(2), and in particular the period in which payments have to be made. However, as the Member States are free to choose any date for making payments within that period, the Commission can take action only where payments are made after the final deadline of 30 June. In such a case, the Commission can reduce the monthly advances paid to the Member States concerned according to the rules laid down in Article 4(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96 Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96 of 16 February 1996 on data to be forwarded by the Member States and the monthly booking expenditure financed under the Guarantee Section of the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2776/88, OJ L 39, 17.2.1996. , that is to say, proportionally to the delay occurred in paying Community subsidies to the farmers.
