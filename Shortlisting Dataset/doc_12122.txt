WRITTEN QUESTION E-3333/09 by Mario Borghezio (UEN) to the Commission (7 May 2009) Subject: EU investigation into the cancer risks posed by mobile phones Press statements issued today ( Le Figaro , 23 April 2009) by the French Minister of Health, Roselyne Bachelot, stress the danger of mobile phones to users' health, particularly when they are used for over 10 years. These concerns have apparently been confirmed in a major epidemiological survey about to be published in France. Could the Commission specify whether the EU does not consider it necessary and a matter of urgency to collect all available scientific information on possible damage caused to people by mobile phones, in order to protect the health of European citizens, especially against the risk of cancer?
