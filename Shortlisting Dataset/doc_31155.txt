WRITTEN QUESTION E-2058/06 by María Salinas García (PSE) to the Commission (12 May 2006) Subject: Greenpeace campaign in the fruit and vegetable sector The organisation Greenpeace is conducting an intensive campaign in Germany regarding the presence of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables sold there. The details of the campaign can be consulted on the website link: http://gruppen.greenpeace.de/aachen/gentechnik.html Greenpeace claims that, although the presence of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetable products does not exceed the maximum residue limits (MRLs) laid down in Community legislation, they are still harmful and endanger the health of consumers. This statement, which is not scientifically proven and was made without taking into account the findings of Community medical and scientific committees, is causing a considerable fall in the consumption of fruit and vegetables and leading to the establishment of unlegislated and arbitrary MRLs that have to be respected by various actors in the food production chain. What measures will the Commission take to solve the problem of arbitrary discrimination affecting fruit and vegetables in Germany because of the Greenpeace campaign regarding MRLs?
