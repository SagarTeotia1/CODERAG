WRITTEN QUESTION E-0497/10 by Fiorello Provera (EFD) to the Commission (16 February 2010) Subject: Transparency and level of corruption in the Palestinian Authority According to the independent monitoring organisation Transparency International, in 2005 the Palestinian Authority was ranked 108th in the international corruption perception index out of the 159 countries listed. Since 2006 the Palestinian Authority has been excluded from this index. In 2005, the European Community committed EUR 280 million to the Palestinian Authority and in each subsequent year, funding amounts have increased significantly. Considering the fact that the Palestinian Authority is not eligible to sign up to the UN Convention against Corruption, how will the Commission make sure that EU aid is properly spent, given the paucity of information available from international bodies regarding the level of corruption? Will the Commission consider suspending payments until the Palestinian Authority is scrutinised for oversights by a relevant international agency?
