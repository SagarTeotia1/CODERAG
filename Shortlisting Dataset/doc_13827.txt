Points out that informatics is an important cost factor in Parliament and that enlargement obliges it to modernise and rationalise this domain; supports its Secretary-General's efforts to make Parliament's informatics landscape more integrated with a view to improving value for money; insists, however, that objectives must be clearly defined before issuing a call for tender and that the evolution of costs needs to be closely monitored; Improving assistance to Members 21. Notes that the Secretary-General has submitted proposals to the Bureau on improving legislative assistance to Members and on a possible new structure for Parliament's administration; recalls that the aim is to offer the best possible service to Members for their legislative and budgetary responsibilities, which are Parliament's core activities; recalls also that the aim is to reduce the compartmentalisation of the administration's structure, to improve the work flows, to minimise the impact of staff being based in three different working places, to make the best use of resources and to prepare the structure of Parliament's administration for the challenge of enlargement; considers that the reform, together with the early retirement scheme, should also be used to establish leaner management structures; recalls its earlier recommendations that, for the performance of Members' duties, a research assistance structure must be provided in connection with both parliamentary work and the performance of a Member's duties in general; expects the budgetary authority to be notified of the budgetary implications in good time in order to incorporate them into the discussions on the budget; 22.
