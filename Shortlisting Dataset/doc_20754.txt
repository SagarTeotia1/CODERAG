WRITTEN QUESTION E-2018/05 by Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 June 2005) Subject: Letter from Mr Barbaso to the newspaper ‘Fileleftheros’ The Cypriot newspaper ‘Fileleftheros’ published an article by its Brussels correspondent concerning emblems relating to the unrecognised ‘State’ of the ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ which were hanging in the office of a Commission official whose particular duties involve Cyprus. Instead of the Commission concerning itself with how to ensure the impression of objectivity in the eyes of any European citizens who might ask to visit this particular official in his office, the Director-General of the DG for Enlargement, Mr Barbaso, sent a letter to the editor-in-chief of the newspaper in which he severely, and in unacceptable fashion, criticised the report, which for Cypriot readers was an item of news. The author of the letter assumes the role of judge as to what constitutes serious journalism or not. The editors of a newspaper and the journalist are the only judges of what is publishable and the final arbiters of what is serious or not are the readers themselves. This attempt by a Commission official to make a qualitative judgment on news circulation is an outright endeavour to impose indirect censorship by the EU's supranational executive aimed at gagging similar news reports in the future. The letter also arbitrarily alleges that the journalist himself entered the office concerned without permission, which can be construed as an attempt to intimidate and exert pressure to reveal his sources and methods of investigation. Leaving aside the right of anyone to pass judgment on an article, will the Commissioner responsible say to what extent the style and tone of the letter may be considered to be unethical interference with the principle of freedom of the press?
