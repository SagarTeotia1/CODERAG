Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (30 March 2011) The Commission is aware of this report and shares the concerns highlighted by the Honourable Member as regards a potential increase in the proportion of the population facing problems associated with gambling. Indeed, there are social costs linked to this problem which are not only related to costs of treatment but to the effects this has on individual players and their families. Unfortunately, few Member States have carried out such studies or gathered statistics on this issue See reply to Question E‑967/10 (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp). . The implementation of prevention schemes and measures to inform on risks of problem gambling are primarily the responsibility of national authorities. However, the issue of gambling addiction will be one of the issues covered by the broad consultation that was launched on 24 March 2011. Through this consultation the Commission seeks to accrue clearer information and data on a number of complex issues, including the policy objectives of Member States in this respect.
