crime operates in a way that causes the number of users to increase rapidly, encouraging them to move from relatively inoffensive substances, such as cannabis derivatives, to so-called hard drugs, - great economic need and the enormous pressure from organised crime lead users of illicit substances to become dealers themselves, which increases drug abuse still further, Legal and penal aspects whereas: - the application of repressive laws on drugs inevitably puts intolerable pressure on national and international legal and penal systems, to such an extent that a growing number of the people now in prison are there for crimes directly or indirectly linked to narcotics and psychotropic substances, - the implementation of current drug policy has led to the introduction into national legislation of laws that restrict individual freedom and civil liberties, whereas the viability of current policies and the search for alternative solutions are currently under consideration in a growing number of countries, 1. Contends that the policy of prohibiting drugs, based on the UN Conventions of 1961, 1971 and 1988, is the true cause of the increasing damage that the production of, trafficking in, and sale and use of illegal substances are inflicting on whole sectors of society, on the economy and on public institutions, eroding the health, freedom and life of individuals; 2. Strongly urges the Council and the EU Member States to take account of the positive results achieved in a number of countries by putting in place policies based on damage and risk reduction (particularly using substitution treatment), decriminalising the use of certain substances, partially decriminalising the sale of cannabis and its derivatives and making heroin available under medical supervision; 3. Calls on the Council and the EU Member States to take measures to make the fight against organised crime and trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances more effective, by establishing a system of legal control and regulation of the production, sale and use of currently illegal substances; 4. Calls on the Council and the EU Member States to begin a process of revising the UN Conventions on the occasion of the conference for the mid-term review of UN drug policies to be held in Vienna in April 2003, with the aim of repealing or amending the 1961 and 1971 Conventions with a view to reclassifying substances and legalise the use of drugs for purposes other than medical or scientific ones, and to repealing the 1988 Convention.
