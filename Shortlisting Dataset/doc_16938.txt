Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (12 August 2011) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Questions E‑003109/2010 by Mr Romeva i Rueda, E‑003754/2010 by Mr Tsoukalas and E‑000404/2011 by Mr Watson http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/home.do?language=EN . Exemptions with deductibility of the VAT paid at the preceding stage (the so called ‘zero rates’) constitute exceptions to the general rules on VAT rates. They form part of temporary derogations granted to certain Member States under certain conditions, without any possibility of extension. Furthermore, zero rates are in conflict with the very nature of VAT, which, as a general consumption tax, is levied on all taxable supplies of goods and services. Such exceptions thus reduce the economic efficiency of VAT. As far as the Commission is aware, not a single Member State applies an exemption of VAT on the supply of electronic books. Finally, the Commission is currently analysing the contributions to the consultation launched by the Green paper on the evaluation of the current VAT system and the possible ways forward to improve it COM(2010)695 final. . Based on the feedback received and the conclusions drawn from this debate, the Commission will present the priorities for the future VAT system in a Communication by the end of 2011.
