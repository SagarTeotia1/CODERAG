that the major challenges faced by the EU and the Member States with regard to employment and unemployment should also be duly reflected in the future process on macroeconomic imbalances, within the policy framework of the European employment guidelines; 3. Considers that the Annual Growth Survey and the framework provided by the European Semester are crucial tools for the enhanced coordination of economic policies and, therefore, an important part of the Union's response to the crisis; notes, however, that these tools should be employed in a manner which respects democratic processes and should support, and not replace or diminish the importance of, the existing tools provided for under the Treaty, in particular the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, with which Parliament must be closely involved and, on the latter, consulted; calls for these tools to be integrated closely into the framework of the European Semester and for particular attention to be paid to ensuring that their importance does not diminish, with a view to delivering on the Commission and Council's stated objective of increasing ownership and democratic accountability; 4. Calls on the Council and the Commission, when providing policy advice to Member States, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and social dialogue in the field of wages and pensions as well and, in line with Article 153(5) TFEU, to respect the competences of the Member States and social partners, in accordance with national practices, in these areas; 5. Urges the European Council, the Council and the Commission to ensure that the Europe 2020 strategy and the strengthened European economic governance system are effective and democratically legitimate; emphasises that this makes the genuine and timely involvement of Parliament throughout the surveillance and policy coordination procedures essential; deplores the lack of a reference to Parliament's role in the process in the timeline proposed in the Annual Growth Survey; 6. Calls on the Member States to involve more closely and regularly consult the national parliaments, the social partners, regional and local authorities and civil society; considers that the current lack of information on the consultation procedures in the National Reform Programmes should be addressed; 7. Notes the preliminary indication of the Member States' national employment targets; expresses deep concern at the lack of ambition in this regard, and in particular at the fact that in the best-case scenario the estimated collective outcome would fall short, by more than 2 percentage points, of the EU headline target and the commitment to reach an employment rate of 75% by 2020; 8. Calls on the Member States to reconsider their national employment targets, so that the EU headline target can be met, and to take these targets as seriously as their fiscal consolidation ones; 9. Calls, further, on the Member States to pay special attention to, and set national targets for, specific sub-groups, such as young people, women, people with disabilities and older workers; 10. Calls on those Member States which have not yet done so to set their national targets on social inclusion and the fight against
