Question for written answer E-008431/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (21 September 2011) Subject: Suspension of disbursement of loan by the European Investment Bank The European Investment Bank (EIB) has reportedly suspended the disbursement of loans contracted with Greek banks, private companies and the Greek State because of Greece's low credit rating. Given that very many major projects are being co-financed by the EIB in Greece through the NSRF and other programmes, will the Commission say: — Is there any truth in the above reports that the disbursement of EIB loans to Greece has been frozen? If so, on the basis of which regulation was this decision taken by the EIB? Will the Commission provide the relevant announcement by the EIB? — What is the amount of the suspended payments? Will it provide the list of the projects concerned by these payments?
