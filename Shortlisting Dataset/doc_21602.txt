ORAL QUESTION H-0467/03 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by James Fitzsimons to the Commission Subject: 'Neighbourhood Programmes' The Commission has indicated that it intends to improve the EU’s interventions at its external borders in order to boost cooperation with Russia, the Western Balkans and countries in the Mediterranean. Existing instruments such as PHARE-CB and MEDA will be better coordinated through the creation of ‘Neighbourhood Programmes’. Will the Commission state if this means that countries such as the Lebanon and Syria will benefit from this new proposal and, if so, in what ways?
