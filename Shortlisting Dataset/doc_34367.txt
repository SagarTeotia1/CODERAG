WRITTEN QUESTION E-4193/08 by András Gyürk (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (22 July 2008) Subject: Question concerning the construction of the Hungarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, with particular regard to Community competition law On 28 February 2008, Hungary and Russia signed the ‘cooperation agreement on construction of a gas pipeline to transport gas across the territory of the Republic of Hungary’. The Agreement concerns construction of the section of the South Stream pipeline in Hungary and will be in force for at least 30 years. According to the Agreement, a joint enterprise with a 50‑50 % ownership share will be established in Hungary, under Hungarian law, by the two founders — the Hungarian Development Bank and Gazprom PLC — which will construct the Hungarian section of the pipeline. Does the Commission consider that the Hungarian Government’s signature of a legally binding international agreement setting out the basic provisions governing a joint enterprise carrying out all the functions of an independent economic entity (with founders and an ownership structure) without previously informing the national competition authorities, as required by national competition legislation or Council Regulation 139/2004/EC of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (depending on whether the concentration qualifies as having a Community dimension), is consistent with Community competition law? Does the Commission think that the provisions of Articles 3, 5, 9, 10 and 11 are consistent with Community legislation on state aid?
