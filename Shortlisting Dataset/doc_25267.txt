Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2011) The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that citizens are not sufficiently aware of the European Union's regional policy. The Commission also agrees that informing on co-funded projects and on results achieved is fundamental. According to the principle of shared management, the managing authority of a programme is responsible for its transparent and well publicised implementation. Some duties fall also on the beneficiaries. Information and publicity rules for cohesion policy are laid out in Article 69 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 OJ L 210 of 31.7.2006 . , and in more detail in the Commission implementing Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006 of 8 December 2006 OJL 371 of 27.12.2006. , Articles 2-10, including the simplification as defined in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 846/2009 of 1 September 2009 OJL 250 of 23.9.2009. . Transparency is ensured primarily by making the funding opportunities known to potential beneficiaries and by publishing the list of selected project beneficiaries. In the case of France, the following websites have been developed, which are considered to be both user-friendly and informative: www.europe-en-france.gouv.fr, and http://cartobenef.asp-public.fr/cartobenef/ For infrastructure projects (or in case of a purchase of a physical object) for which the total public contribution (EU plus national funding) exceeds EUR 500 000, a billboard has to be put up, by the beneficiary, during the construction phase and a permanent plaque has to be set up within six months of completion of the project. For this, as for any information and publicity measure, the following elements have to be included: — The emblem of the EU (flag); — A reference to the fund concerned not applicable for small promotional items. ; — A statement highlighting the added value of the intervention of the Union, such as ‘Investing in your future’ not applicable for small promotional items. . It is the responsibility of the managing authority in charge of the management of the programme concerned to ensure that beneficiaries are aware of their responsibilities and to monitor compliance with the rules. Should a citizen notice any lack of visibility, the managing authority or the Commission should be made aware of it in order to correct the situation.
