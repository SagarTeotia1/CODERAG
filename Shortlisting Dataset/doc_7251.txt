ORAL QUESTION H-0865/05 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Pedro Guerreiro to the Council Subject: Fishing activity and rising fuel prices Following the positions stated by fishermen and their representative body with regard to the impact of rising fuel prices on the fishing industry, the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers of 19 and 20 September quite incomprehensibly yet again merely 'took note' of the situation, without deciding to take any measures in response to the problem. As the fishermen have highlighted, the rise in fuel prices is causing major difficulties for the industry, endangering the viability of many vessels if measures are not taken immediately, e.g. to provide financial support which will minimise the added costs represented by higher fuel prices. It should be stressed that rising fuel prices are worsening the already difficult situation faced by many small scale traditional fishermen, who have no support helping to reduce the impact of successive fuel price increases. Independently of other, long-term action, what immediate support measures for the fishing industry and specifically for small scale traditional fisheries does the Council intend to take?
