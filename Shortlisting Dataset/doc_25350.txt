WRITTEN QUESTION P-4654/07 by Filip Kaczmarek (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (26 September 2007) Subject: Funds allocated to the list of key projects under the EU's Infrastructure and Environment Programme for investment in a new technologies incubator for civil society development by the Higher School of Media and Social Culture in Torun As part of the list of key projects under the EU's Infrastructure and Environment Programme, the Polish Government has included funds intended for the Higher School of Media and Social Culture in Torun. The funds are to be used for the establishment of a new technologies incubator for civil society development. The Higher School of Media and Social Culture is an educational institute which is closed to persons holding different political and social views from those in charge of the school. Many observers feel that, as a result of this decision by the Polish Government, Union funds may be going to a body which challenges the foundations on which the Union is built, such as respect for citizens' rights and freedoms as regards religious, ethnic and national diversity and other minority rights. 1. Is the Commission aware of this problem? 2. Can it endorse the funding of projects which may run counter to the European Union's basic values? 3. Has the Commission any scope to take action on this matter and will it do so? If so, what action will it take?
