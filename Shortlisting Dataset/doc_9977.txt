Programme for Action on accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis as they constitute coherent initiatives that extend beyond traditional strategies in addressing health and development in the context of poverty reduction in the developing countries; calls on the Commission to put in place a mechanism to ensure effective coordination across the Directorates-General participating in the Programme for Action; 2. Considers that, in order to efficiently implement the Community Programme for Action, funds have to be increased (notably Community aid, including EDF funding) and used, as a priority, for reinforcing healthcare services and structures (including building and improving medical centres, providing equipment and training medical staff) in developing countries; stresses that this not only requires more investment in basic health services, but also the transfer of know-how and technologies in order to develop national capacity and increase the level of self-sufficiency in developing countries; calls on the Commission therefore to give priority to a continuous financial aid in this field, since well-functioning health care systems are essential components in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; 3. Stresses that EU actions should be based around the principles of sustainability and ownership by developing countries, and that finding sustainable solutions will require substantial political commitment from both developing countries and developed countries; 4. Points out that effective and coherent action against communicable diseases must simultaneously combine: - prevention, through information and education campaigns, immunisation programmes and action to promote better living conditions, as good housing, employment, nutrition etc, provide the best possible prevention; - treatment, which implies access to drugs as well as the availability of health care structures and staff; - research into more effective vaccines and drugs which are better suited to populations in developing countries; 5. Calls on the European Union to adopt directives to untie development aid for tenders on healthcare related products and services and calls on the EU to play a leading role in providing sufficient funding and in establishing appropriate guidelines and support capacity building for more efficient untied procurement, local manufacturing and a tiered pricing mechanism with clear standards to ensure access to affordable pharmaceuticals at marginal costs for prevention and care for these communicable diseases; considers that this mechanism should be transparent and should not be limited in time or place so that all developing countries can benefit from it; considers also that rules on intellectual property concerning the production, use and transport of affordable generic drugs should take account of the need to arrive at equitable prices; 6. Notes that one third of the world's population is under the age of 20, and that half of all new HIV infections occur in the 15-24 age group; calls on the Commission therefore to give particular attention to preventing HIV infection in this age group by providing them with the information, education and services necessary to reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection, and promoting the use of condoms; considers that parents, primary and secondary school teachers, health workers, politicians, religious leaders etc. in the communities must be trained along these lines, and that
