Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (18 December 2008) The Commission can confirm that the proposed Regulation applies to all plant protection products, whether produced in the EU or imported. The safety of food with regard to residues of pesticides is regulated by Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 OJ L 70, 16.3.2005. in which all EU maximum residue levels (MRL) are defined. All food on the market must comply with these MRLs irrespective of its origin, domestic or imported.
