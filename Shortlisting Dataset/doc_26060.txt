WRITTEN QUESTION E-6473/09 by Theodoros Skylakakis (PPE) to the Commission (4 January 2010) Subject: Follow-up to the joint motion for a resolution on this summer's natural disasters in Southern Europe (P7_TA-PROV(2009)0013) In the September 2009 plenary part-session of the European Parliament, the Chamber adopted by an overwhelming majority the joint motion for a resolution on this summer's natural disasters in Southern Europe. Southern Europe is predicted to be an extremely vulnerable region in terms of climate change. Having taken this into consideration, the European Parliament called for flexible, rapid, coordinated and multilateral efforts in order to take a preventive stand towards the devastating wildfires and floods which will occur in the coming years. The key elements of the resolution urged the Commission, inter alia , to present a genuine Community disaster response capability, covering forest fires and other types of disasters. — Taking into consideration the urgency of the situation as recognised by Parliament, what action will the Commission take in order to respond to the proposals in question? — Furthermore, Parliament found it essential that the prevention and combating of droughts and forest fires (in Southern Europe) should be prioritised in the EU action plan for adapting to climate change. Has this already been taken into consideration by the Commission and if so, what efforts are being made in this direction? — According to the White Paper on adaptation to climate change, it is suggested that climate change is likely to affect forest health and productivity as well as the geographic range of certain tree species. It suggests updating the EU forestry strategy on climate-related aspects and proposes launching a debate on options for an EU approach to forest protection and forest information systems. To what extent will this debate also take protection against forest fires into account and how exactly would this be achieved?
