threats and incitement to violence against individuals expressing views deemed ‘offensive’ by some adherents of religions and beliefs systems are totally unacceptable, that those responsible for such threats and incitement must be prosecuted, and that the freedom of expression and safety of the threatened individuals must be fully guaranteed; 7. Urges the Iranian authorities to remove the concept of ‘deserving of death’ from the revised Penal Code currently under discussion in Iran's parliament; is gravely concerned that the existence of fatwas calling for the killing of an individual could be used as a defence in Iranian courts by individuals accused of murder, on the grounds that the victim ‘deserved to die’; urges the Iranian authorities to ensure that anyone suspected of inciting, planning, committing or aiding murder, whether the killing takes place in Iran or elsewhere, is brought to justice in a trial which fully meets international fair trial standards; 8. Calls on the Iranian authorities to offer all necessary cooperation to the Azerbaijani authorities during the investigation of the murder of Rafig Tagi, and to ensure that Iranian clerics do not call for the murder of anyone, whether in Iran or in any other country; 9. Calls on the Azerbaijani authorities to show their genuine commitment to human rights and comply with their obligations under international law and in the context of Euronest, the Eastern Partnership or any future Association Agreement with the EU, in particular the protection of the right to life and to freedom of expression; 10. Deplores the failure of the Azerbaijani authorities to grant a visa to the rapporteur on political prisoners of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe; calls on the Government of Azerbaijan to allow the rapporteur to visit the country in order to investigate the situation of the alleged political prisoners; 11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Governments and Parliaments of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the EEAS, the Council, the Commission and the UN Human Rights Council.
