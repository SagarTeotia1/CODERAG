WRITTEN QUESTION E-0737/07 by Emilio Menéndez del Valle (PSE) to the Commission (19 February 2007) Subject: Need for European support for the peace process in Colombia Violent crime, delinquency and the activities of organised gangs have become one of the direct threats to peace and stability in various Latin American countries (‘Maras’ in Central America, a perfectly organised form of criminal vandalism, which harasses and sometimes defeats the police in Sao Paulo and Caracas, which has become one of the most unsafe metropolises in the world). The Guatemalan Government has even called in United Nations experts to assist its fight against crime, because the forces of law and order are unable to cope. In many countries the judiciary and the police are weak, complicit or corrupt, and this may lead to permanent public disorder. In this context the Vice-President of Colombia, Francisco Santos, has made a number of statements criticising the EU’s efforts to consolidate peace in his country, where the Union has spent EUR 100 million on three ‘Peace Laboratories’ since 2002. Their aim is to work with local communities, foster their capacity for initiative and offer alternatives to the cultivation of coca as a source of revenue. The Commissioner for External Relations, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, praised these laboratories in 2004, calling them ‘comprehensive programmes of integrated local development aiming to shoulder peace initiatives at local level’. However, Vice-President Santos says that there are many projects concerning human rights and peaceful coexistence, but that not many of them are productive. In view of all this, does the Commission consider it is worthwhile continuing with the projects in Colombia that the Commissioner praised in 2004? Does the Commission have any alternatives to offer on the assumption that the projects are not a success?
