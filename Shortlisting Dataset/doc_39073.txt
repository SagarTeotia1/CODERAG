Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (21 May 2008) Stairlifts are subject to the provisions of Directive 98/37/EC OJ L 207, 23.7.1998. on machinery which is implemented in the national law of all the Member States. Member States remain free to introduce national provisions to encourage or regulate the provision of means of access for people with reduced mobility to public or private buildings. Such provisions are usually included in national building regulations. These provisions may include measures relating to public funding for such installations. Such provisions are not harmonised at Community level.
