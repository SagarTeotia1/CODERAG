of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive to cover B2B contracts with specific regard to point 21 of Annex I thereto, requests the Commission to report by December 2009 on the feasibility and possible consequences of such amendment or extension; 5. Urges the Commission to consider the particular position of SMEs when defining the 'consumer' in its review of the consumer acquis; asks that this also form part of the work on the Common Frame of Reference on Contract Law, so that SMEs might benefit from a stronger protective regime in Community legislation on contractual issues; 6. Welcomes the Small Business Act's call for Member States to reinforce the SOLVIT network and to provide SMEs with advisory services and support to defend themselves against unfair commercial practices; calls for the Commission to become actively involved in the cooperation and provision of assistance to those who fall victim to the operators of misleading directory companies; calls further for the Commission and the Member States to cooperate on awareness raising campaigns regarding such misleading practices, with extensive use of the tools that the internet may offer and with the involvement of SME and consumer organisations, including the Enterprise Europe Network and the European Consumer Centres; looks forward to the Commission's proposed e-justice portal as a further means of delivering information and assistance regarding these problems; 7. Regrets that, whilst the European order for payment procedure rightly improves cross-border access to justice, unscrupulous debt-collecting bodies could use it to harass SMEs and individuals; advises that consideration be given to an EU-wide code of conduct for debt-collecting bodies; 8. Calls for Member States to cooperate actively to bring an end to the practices of misleading directory companies and any similar activities; 9. Notes that where Member States are unwilling or unable to act, mechanisms should be devised to allow individual victims to seek joint redress through the courts on a cross-border basis; calls, therefore, on the Member States and the Commission to consider bringing into operation a coherent system of collective redress for the settlement of cross-border complaints, based on both extensive research drawing on experience around the world and a thorough examination of existing problems and the envisaged benefits for consumers, and dealing clearly with the question of an appropriate legal base for such an instrument at EU level; 10. Regrets the fact that the difficulties involved in tracking down activities of this nature distort the internal market and affect the way in which competition operates; 11. Urges the Member States to take action against all the fraudulent activities engaged in by ECG and other, similar companies, as a last resort by suspending their activities in order to prevent consumers and businesses from being harmed; 12. Calls upon the Member States’ supervisory bodies – in accordance with their mandate and with the responsibilities conferred upon them pursuant to their country's domestic law and to EU legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection
