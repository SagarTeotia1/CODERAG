Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (1 July 2009) To date the Republic of Moldova has not applied for EU membership. The Commission remains committed to further deepening the relationship between the EU and the Republic of Moldova, on the basis of shared values and principles. In this respect, the Eastern Partnership, launched in Prague on 7 May 2009 as a specific dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy, provides a new, ambitious framework for taking the EU‑Republic of Moldova relations to a new level. Work under the Eastern Partnership will go ahead without prejudice to individual participating countries' aspirations for their future relationship with the European Union. The Commission’s European Neighbourhood Policy Progress Report 2008 on the Republic of Moldova http://ec.europa.eu/world/enp/pdf/progress2009/sec09_514_en.pdf has highlighted a number of shortcomings as regards the country’s efforts in the domains of EU legal approximation and economic integration. The practical consequences of those shortcomings, which concern mostly the effective enforcement of internal reforms and the media landscape, were revealed openly during the last electoral campaign in the Republic of Moldova and the events that ensued. As the Republic of Moldova makes genuine progress on political and economic reforms, the country’s relations with the EU will become deeper and stronger.
