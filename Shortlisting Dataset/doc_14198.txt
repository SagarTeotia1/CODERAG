WRITTEN QUESTION E-2747/04 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (4 November 2004) Subject: Pharmaceutical companies' ‘quotas’ of medicines Medicinal products account for approximately one third of medical and health care costs in Europe. It is, therefore, in the general interest that the prices of such products should not climb too high so that the principle of public subsidy of medicines can be retained to as great an extent as possible in order to protect the weakest sections of society. Access to medicines, however, is not only dependent on cost. In a directive adopted earlier this year, it was agreed that the pharmaceutical companies should ‘ensure appropriate and continued supplies of medicinal products’ (Directive 2004/27/EC JO L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 34 ). This statement would not seem to reflect the reality, however, since many pharmaceutical companies unilaterally and deliberately restrict access to prevent parallel trade. Such action has serious effects on medical and health care. Although the above legislation is not applicable until it has been transposed into Member States' national law, will the Commission nevertheless state its views on the problem outlined above and say what action it will take to ensure that the pharmaceutical companies comply with the intentions of the Directive?
