OPINION of the Committee on Development for the Committee on International Trade on trade and poverty: designing trade policies to maximise trade’s contribution to poverty relief ( 2006/2031(INI) ) Draftswoman: Danutė Budreikaitė SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Development calls on the Committee on International Trade, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Reiterates that fair trade can be one of the effective tools for poverty reduction; considers, however, that action against poverty requires above all a radical change of policy in both industrialised and developing countries in order to address the structural causes of poverty through fair trade rules, and that the attainment of all eight UN Millennium Development Goals should be regarded as the overriding task in the current negotiations on the world trade system and the Economic Partnership Agreements; 2. Recalls the EU commitment, under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, to promote sustainable development and poverty eradication in the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP); and considers that the EU, as an important trade player in the multilateral institutions, could contribute to the reinforcement of the developing countries’ position by shaping a more coherent and comprehensive policy, in accordance with Article 178 of the EC Treaty; stresses, however, the significant input of other international donors; 3. Notes that, according to UNCTAD, in 2004 the 50 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) – more than one third of ACP countries - accounted for over 11% of the world’s population (742 million), but only 0.6% of the world’s GDP; 4. Stresses the importance of maintaining and strengthening the multilateral trade frameworks; recalls that within the WTO, as a forum for shaping a fair rules-based system for international trade, special emphasis should be placed on increasing the developing countries’ negotiating capacities in order to enable them to better represent their trade interests and integrate them into the global economy; 5. Considers that during the WTO 6th Ministerial Conference, some progress was made with regard to Special Products and Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) and Special and Differential Treatment (SDT), taking into account the concerns of developing countries about the impact of trade liberalisation and reciprocity, but emphasises that much still remains to be done; stresses that SDT must be fully reflected in the negotiations on modalities for tariff reductions in trade in agricultural and industrial goods, in order to allow poorer developing countries sufficient time to consolidate their industrialisation efforts; 6. Welcomes the decision to abolish export subsidies in agriculture by 2013 and calls once again for the implementation of decisions already taken to be brought forward significantly; however, as these export subsidies account for only 3.5% of overall EU agricultural support, urges the Commission to continue discussions on finalising the modalities by which agricultural domestic subsidies and tariffs can be reduced in all industrialised countries; 7. Stresses the importance, also for developing countries, of enhancing market access for service providers, whilst safeguarding the ability of all WTO members to regulate their own service sectors in accordance with the GATS agreement, including the possibility of exempting basic
