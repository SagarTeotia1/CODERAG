Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (30 June 2008) First of all, the Commission wishes to remind to the Honourable Member that the European Union is opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Furthermore, the Commission wishes to point out that it is not in a position to verify the information reported by the Honourable Member concerning the Mengistu Haile Mariam's political associates allegedly living in the Italian Embassy compound Addis Ababa. In any case, the responsibility for running the Embassy is the sole competence of the Member State concerned.
