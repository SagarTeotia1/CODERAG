Reply (2 October 2003) The Council would remind the Honourable Member that, in accordance with Article 283 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of those Communities are laid down by the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the other institutions concerned. The proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Staff Regulations of officials and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities (Revision of the Staff Regulations) is currently being examined by the Council's subordinate bodies. Under the procedure provided for, the European Parliament will have an opportunity to put its position on this point.
