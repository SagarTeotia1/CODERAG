Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (18 April 2011) The Commission would point out that the question of the Honourable Member is similar to his Oral Question H‑0037/2010 and the Written Question E‑4818/2009 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp by Mr Kriton Arsenis and would therefore refer the Honourable Member to the corresponding answers already given. The Honourable Member has not provided any additional information which would justify a different assessment.
