Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (1 September 2011) Following the report prepared in 2007 by the Expert Group on customer mobility in relation to bank accounts, the Commission services carried out an internal analysis of various options concerning bank account switching, one of them being bank account number portability. This issue was also considered in the impact assessment accompanying Directive 2007/64/EC on Payment Services. As a result of those analyses, it would seem that the costs related to the introduction of account number portability are disproportionately high. In fact its introduction would incur very high costs, estimated at EUR 14.7 billion. In addition, there would be considerable reorganisation costs and there could be problems for the efficient, straight-through-processing of payments. Taking into account these substantial expenses, the costs of account number portability were considered disproportionate relative to the objective of enhancing customer mobility, in general, and reducing the transaction costs of the payments switching process, more specifically. As a result, the Commission services did not ask the banking industry to include bank account portability when developing Common Principles for bank account switching. Nevertheless and looking to the future, the Commission recognises the merits of bank account portability from a customer perspective and will continue to monitor the situation in the light of market developments and of best practices emerging from national experiences.
