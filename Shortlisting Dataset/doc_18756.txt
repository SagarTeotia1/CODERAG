transit countries, which would lay down a code of conduct and prohibition of disruption due to commercial disputes, and explicitly outline measures to be taken in the event of unilateral disruption, or any change in the terms of the contract or in the terms of supply by one of the partners; 48. Recalls that, even with the help of ambitious and rigorously implemented energy efficiency and energy saving plans, the European Union is likely still to be dependent in the medium term on third countries for supplies of fossil energy; calls therefore for dialogue with producer, transit and other consumer countries to be stepped up and, more generally, for enhanced international cooperation to increase transparency on world energy markets and to tackle the issue of sustainable development; 49.

Calls on the European Union to cooperate with the countries of the Mediterranean region, and of North Africa in view of their significant energy resource potential and substantial opportunities for development of Africa; believes, in particular, that the use of solar and wind energy should be researched and encouraged; calls, therefore, for common objectives for renewable energy and energy efficiency to be included in the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean; 51. Calls on the European Union to cooperate with the countries of Middle East in view of their significant energy resource potential; 52. Supports the intention to negotiate a wide-ranging new agreement replacing the 1997 Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia including the Chapter on Energy, which should fully respect the principles of the Energy Charter Treaty and its transit protocols; notes that Russia has signed and Ukraine ratified the Energy Charter Treaty; recalls that it contains amongst others the dispute settlement mechanism which provides for dispute settlement for instance in the case of transit or trade disputes between the respective parties to the Treaty; 53. Stresses the need to include Ukraine in the European arrangements for ongoing dialogue with Russia on account of the key role which Ukraine plays as a transit country; 54. Urges the Commission, so as to ensure security of supply, to consider extending the Energy Community Treaty between the European Union and South-Eastern Europe to other third countries and to creating new regional energy markets with neighbouring countries on the model of the South East Europe Energy Community, including for example, the Euro-Mediterranean Energy Community, 55. Stresses the need to include Turkey in the European arrangements for ongoing dialogue with the Caspian/Caucasus region on account of the key role which Turkey can play as a transit country; reiterates at the same time Turkey's commitments as a candidate country for the alignment with the acquis communautaire ; 56. Stresses the geopolitical importance of the Black Sea region for the Union's energy security and for the diversification of its energy supplies; 57.
