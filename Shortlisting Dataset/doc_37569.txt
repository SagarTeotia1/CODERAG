competence of the Member States, the Commission is of the opinion that the delays caused by purely administrative reasons in the academic recognition procedure in Greece can discourage students from exercising their right to free movement. The excessive length of the administrative procedure can raise obstacles to the free movement of students. The Commission has already contacted the Greek authorities asking what are the reasons that justify the delays in the academic recognition procedure. The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that the delays were in part due to the large number of applications received by Dikatsa. In order to expedite the process of recognition, the Greek authorities have reviewed the relevant national regulations and proposed to put new procedures in place. Dikatsa has been restructured in order to be able to deal with the large number of applications effectively. The Commission continues to follow the evolution of the process of academic recognition in Greece.
