Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (19 January 2009) The Commission had the opportunity of replying to concerns about the situation of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia in Written Questions P‑5663/08 and P‑5730/08 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the answers to these questions. The Member States must use all legal instruments available to them in order to guarantee the rights of minorities in accordance with their constitutional order and international law obligations. The authorities of the Member States, political parties and civil rights organisations must unequivocally distance themselves and actively fight all manifestations of phenomena that are incompatible with the values that the EU is based upon, be it racism, xenophobia, totalitarian ideologies, hooliganism or violence. The Commission is confident that the authorities of both Hungary and Slovakia will behave in conformity with the values that are common to all Member States.
