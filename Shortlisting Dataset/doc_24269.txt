Question for written answer E-7991/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Christel Schaldemose (S&D) (6 October 2010) Subject: ECE marking of child car seats In reply to my question of 17 July 2009 on child car seats, the Commission stated that it sees further room for improvement in this area, since child seats approved in accordance with the ECE common European safety approval standards do not offer optimum protection. I realise that the Commission is participating in the drafting of up-to-date rules as part of UN-ECE cooperation, but I am concerned that this updating process is taking such a long time. Citizens should be able to have confidence in the EU mark, and they should know with certainty that ECE-marked seats are also safe. Therefore it is important for marking to keep pace with developments in this field. What initiatives has the Commission launched to tighten the requirements for the ECE marking of child car seats? Will the Commission tighten the requirements for granting ECE approval, to ensure that side and frontal collision tests are also carried out at a speed of 65 km/h?
