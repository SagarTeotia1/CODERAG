WRITTEN QUESTION E-4780/07 by Guy Bono (PSE) to the Commission (2 October 2007) Subject: Plant-health products and the internal market Certain plant-health products are in circulation in some Member States and not in others. The farmers who use these products can therefore take effective, and usually less expensive, action on their crops, while others cannot, giving rise to a problem of distortion of competition. Insufficient harmonisation is apparently harming the operation of the single market. What has become of the principle of free movement of these products in the single market?
