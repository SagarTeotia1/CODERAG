Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (31 January 2008) The Commission is aware that safety and environmental legislation for coaches together with enhanced customer comfort requirements such as air conditioning etc. add weight to the coach. As the coach's maximum weight and individual axle loads are limited, the effect is a reduction in available payload: the estimate of around one tonne corresponds to estimates made by the operating industry. Directive 96/53/EC Council Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic, OJ L 235, 17.9.1996. sets out the maximum allowable vehicle and loading dimensions in national and international road transport in the EU. Member States may operate higher weights than those specified in Directive 96/53/EC for national transport operations, but must comply with the maxima in international transport. The Commission is embarking on a study of the maximum weights and dimensions of commercial vehicles. The study began in December 2007 and its results are expected by July 2008. The study focuses on freight transport but the Commission will extend it to cover the specific subject matter that the Honourable Member refers to.
