WRITTEN QUESTION E-0461/05 by Diana Wallis (ALDE) to the Commission (15 February 2005) Subject: Tobacco advertising and sponsorship 1. Will the Commission clarify Recital 12 of Directive 2003/33/EC OJ L 152, 20.6.2003, p. 16 . and give an outline and example of what it defines as ‘indirect advertising’? Will it also state whether this will have implications for the sale of tobacco and tobacco products via the internet (particularly as this is cross-border)? 2. Does the Commission consider the listing, (either by a brand name and/or picture when giving the price) of tobacco or a tobacco product on a website for sale, to be a form of indirect advertising? 3. Will companies that sell tobacco and tobacco products via the internet have to cease trading because of the Commission's reference to ‘cross-border effects’ (which has clear implications for the use of the internet) and/or because it is seen as a form of ‘indirect advertising’?
