of Senegal 21.10.2003 Senegalese President Mr Abdoulaye Wade will address the Parliament during a formal sitting on Tuesday. Senegal is one of the ACP countries and it is of the 49 least developed countries in the world. In the period 2002-2007 it will receive €282 million from the European Development Fund. Mr Wade was born in 1926 and qualified as a lawyer. He taught at the universities of Boston, Paris, Dakar and the Sorbonne. Mr Wade was elected president of Senegal in March 2000, succeeding Mr Abdou Diouf. Mr Wade founded the opposition Senegalese Democratic Party in 1974 and campaigned for "sopi", change, against the one-party rule by the socialists since Senegal gained independence from France in 1960. For this, he was in exile and repeatedly imprisoned. But he also served as an MP and even as a minister in two coalition governments during the 1990s. Mr Wade contested the office of president for over 20 years, first running in the presidential race in 1978. The Senegalese president has described himself as a "committed pan-Africanist".

Both freight and passenger rail services are covered in the recommendation by Georg JARZEMBOWSKI (EPP-ED, D) on the development of the Community's railways. MEPs believe that swift opening up of the rail network is the only way to counteract the constant increase in heavy goods vehicles and expanding car and air traffic. They therefore want access to rail networks in all EU countries to be opened up by 1 January 2006 at the latest as regards
