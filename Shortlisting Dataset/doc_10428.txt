WRITTEN QUESTION E-1846/04 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Financial considerations in connection with the methods employed to build and operate pipelines and the resulting safety risks 1. Following the disaster which occurred on 30 July 2004 at the Ghislengien industrial estate in the Belgian municipality of Ath, caused by broken or damaged joints in the pipeline which carried Norwegian natural gas from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge to northern France, can the Commission state to what extent financial considerations may have had a bearing on the technical choices made in connection with the laying and subsequent operation of the pipeline? 2. In the light of past controversies concerning the welding of pipelines using a French system or an American system, and the various implications for the safety of the weakest joint, was the pipeline welded using the French or the American system? 3. With a view to saving the cost of laying parallel pipelines, or of a new pipeline with a larger cross section, was the capacity of the pipeline increased by raising the pressure substantially, thereby adding to the risk of leaks and of an uncontrollable expansion in the volume of gas in the event of a sudden temperature increase? 4. Was gas transported in the pipeline at a pressure of 80 atmospheres, and is this normal and acceptable? 5. Did the pipeline, which ran only 1.20 metres under the earth's surface and was therefore vulnerable to the impact of both work carried out above ground and excavation work, meet modern safety requirements? 6. Has this disaster prompted the Commission to consider introducing additional rules governing the welding, pressure-resistance and maximum permitted operating pressure of pipelines and the depth at which they are laid?
