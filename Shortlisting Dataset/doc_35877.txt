WRITTEN QUESTION E-0057/06 by Simon Busuttil (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (18 January 2006) Subject: Visa regime for students from non-EU countries It appears that students coming from non-EU countries, such as China and other countries in the Far East as well as South America, are finding difficulties with the visa regime imposed within the EU. Does the Commission envisage any specific visa regime for students from non-EU countries in order to make EU Member States more attractive for students wishing to study in the EU?
