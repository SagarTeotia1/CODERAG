Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (17 October 2006) The Commission is aware of the existence of the so-called ‘Oderkonferenz’, a network of German and Polish regions along the Oder River, including Berlin. The focus of this network is to explore areas for cooperation and means to make this region more competitive. Moreover, the regions are discussing the most efficient ways of allocating the various funding instruments that are available in this area. Concerning transport, a very important link for the regions is the axis Berlin to Warsaw and further to Russia. The regions have already recognised this in an early stage and have developed a functioning network of contacts as for example the forum of the ‘Ostbrandenburger Verkehrsgespräche’ For information, see web page: http://www.iovg.de/ in Frankfurt an der Oder, established in 1999 and which organised in total 25 conferences on different subjects — mainly focusing economic exchange, trade, transport and border-crossing questions. Concrete plans for the creation of a large Euroregion are not known to the Commission for the time being. The Commission welcomes efforts of Member States' regions to cooperate more closely and more efficiently. The German and Polish regions referred to above are covered by a number of Interreg III programmes (in future: European territorial cooperation programmes) that provide funding to projects in the field of cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.
