WRITTEN QUESTION P-4516/06 by Fernand Le Rachinel (NI) to the Commission (16 October 2006) Subject: Recognition of the Greek part of Cyprus In July 2005 Turkey signed the so-called Ankara Protocol which extends its Customs Union with the European Union to the 10 Member States which joined the Union in 2004, including the Greek part of Cyprus. Ankara is still refusing to apply that agreement to the Greek part of Cyprus, which, in defiance of the international community, it does not recognise. As things stand, Turkish ports and airports are closed to Cypriot ships and aircraft. Does the Commission plan to take urgent political measures to deal with these unacceptable breaches of international law and the principle, enshrined by the Union as a fundamental freedom, of free movement of capital, persons and goods? If so, what measures does it have in mind? Does the Commission regard this as a casus belli which might halt or freeze the accession process opened one year ago, on 3 October 2005, with the 25 European Union Member States?
