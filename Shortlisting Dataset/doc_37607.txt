2004/C 70 E/167 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2901/03 by Antonio Tajani (PPE-DE) to the Commission (1 October 2003) Subject: Safeguarding jobs at the Alcatel plant in Rieti The telecommunications sector is going through a period of recession. In order to tackle the unfavourable situation the Alcatel group has decided on drastic job cuts. Apart from undermining the research sector this policy also threatens to lead to the company's activities being relocated to countries with low labour costs. If they go ahead, Alcatel's restructuring plans will hit Alcatel's factories in southern Italy, in particular the ultramodern establishment in Rieti. Is the Commission aware of the risks for the economy of the Rieti area, where substantial resources have been invested in electronics? Since Alcatel's situation is improving, what steps does the Commission intend to take to prevent a temporary difficulty from seriously damaging employment? How does the Commission intend to safeguard plants such as the one at Rieti, which are considered of strategic importance because of the highly specialised professional staff and equipment?
