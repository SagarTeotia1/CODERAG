Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (11 December 2007) The Commission would like to remind the Honourable Member that, in the absence of provisions for forestry in the EU Treaty, forest policy is the competence of the Member States. The EU offers incentives and financial support as regards fire prevention measures, nature protection, civil protection assistance, restoration of damages and restoration of the production potential. These instruments can be used by Member States for the development and implementation of their own national or regional forest protection plans and strategies. Various Community instruments on the environment can serve as a legal basis for forest protection to the extent these instruments are concerned. For example, in Natura 2000 sites, the Birds Directive Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. and Habitats Directive Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. may provide a legal basis for forest protection. The Commission is aware of a number of reports related to the forest fires in Greece summer 2007, but it cannot confirm the validity of such reports and has no legal basis to act on the basis of such information. The Commission welcomes any initiative aimed at the restoration of habitats in general and forests in particular. However, the Commission is not in the position to individually support such initiatives. While certain Community instruments provide financing to forest restoration, they are administered through the Member States, which should ensure coordination and monitoring, as appropriate.
