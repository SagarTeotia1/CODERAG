Question for written answer E-005319/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (31 May 2011) Subject: Axios — Loudias — Aliakmonas Delta National Park: Construction without the Management Authority's opinion The Axios — Loudias — Aliakmonas Delta National Park Management Authority has complained that, in an area planted with agricultural crops within zone C of the Delta National Park, a ‘mammoth’ warehouse has been built without its opinion having been sought; this is in breach of the law. The building's owner company maintains that it has received an EU grant to build the warehouse at this particular site which is to house waste sorting equipment. Given that Delta is of great environmental significance, has been included in the Natura 2000 network and is also protected by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands: Will the Commission say: has it funded this project, as the owner company claims? Can authorisation have been granted in the absence of an opinion from the National Park Management Authority? What measures does the Commission intend to take?
