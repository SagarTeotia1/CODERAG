Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2010) The Commission is aware of how important it is to manage Familial Hypercholesterolemia in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. According to the Orphanet database funded by the European Commission through its Health Programme, the prevalence of Familial Hypercholesterolemia is estimated at 1 in 500 for the most common type of disease. Orphanet also provides further information and data on this, including links to other resources across the EU. The Commission's only instrument to provide financial support to work on awareness-raising in public health is via its EU Health Programme. The next call for proposals is planned for the beginning of 2011. The Commission is aware that in some of the Member States, guidelines exist for the diagnosis and management of Familial Hypercholesterolemia, such as the NICE guidelines in the UK http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG71 .Drug reimbursement as well as the organisation of healthcare systems are Member States' responsibility.
