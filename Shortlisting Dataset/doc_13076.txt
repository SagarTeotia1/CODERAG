Question for written answer E-004599/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Catherine Grèze (Verts/ALE) (12 May 2011) Subject: Nature of the EU‑Peru and EU‑Colombia free trade agreements In accordance with the timetable set by the Commission, the free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia are to be ratified by the European Parliament by the beginning of 2012. The agreements were signed by the Commission at the end of March and are due to enter into force on 13 April 2012. However, the legal services of the Commission, Parliament and the Council have not yet delivered their opinion on one crucial point, namely whether the signing of these agreements is a matter for the EU alone, or for the EU and the Member States, on the basis of a shared competence. German, UK and Irish MEPs have tabled motions insisting that the agreements with Colombia and Peru be declared ‘mixed’ and therefore subject to debate and ratification by their respective national parliaments. The MEPs are of the view that the clauses on disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (Article 2), democracy and human rights (Article 1), both of which the Commission considers ‘essential’, and certain clauses on the environment demonstrate the ‘mixed’ nature of these agreements. The impact of the agreements will also extend beyond the purely commercial, affecting areas such as public health, essential services and the ability of Member States to promote sustainable development. Several lawyers have backed this view. Does the Council consider the agreements to be mixed or non-mixed in nature? Insofar as the decision taken is likely to set a legal precedent, what lawyers does the Council intend to call on to make the ruling?
