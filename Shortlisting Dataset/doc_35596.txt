WRITTEN QUESTION E-0080/05 by Robert Goebbels (PSE) to the Commission (18 January 2005) Subject: Abolition of commissions paid by airlines to travel agencies Since 1 January 2005, practically all airlines no longer pay commission on tickets issued by travel agencies. As a direct consequence of this decision, travel agencies are forced to raise their prices, passing on the extra cost to their customers. At the same time, airlines are increasingly offering very attractive ticket prices through their internet sites, thereby taking a considerable amount of custom away from travel agencies. Is not the Commission of the opinion that this conduct on the part of the airlines constitutes a concerted action in breach of the Treaty? Has the Commission established that the policy pursued by the airlines does not constitute an agreement counter to EU competition policy and, in particular, to Article 81(1)(d) of the Treaty?
