Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (3 February 2011) The Commission is well aware of the problem of corruption and human rights abuses by the Nigerian police force. For this reason it has ensured that tackling police corruption and human rights abuses is among the priorities for assistance under the current strategy of EU cooperation with Nigeria. One of the three focal priorities under the EU-Nigeria Country Strategy of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) (2008‑13) is Peace and Security. An important aspect of this includes assistance towards reducing corruption among policing agencies together with their improved commitment to the protection of human rights. In addition to the specific support addressing corruption and human rights abuses in the policing agencies, a broad cross-cutting approach has been taken to tackling corruption and human rights abuses in Nigeria under the 10th EDF. Under the priority Governance and Human Rights, EU support is foreseen to upgrade the competence of anti-corruption bodies, and also to enhance the functioning of the judiciary. The latter sector will include support for monitoring of abuses by non-state actors. Under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, the EU engages in regular political dialogue with Nigeria on human rights and democratic principles. The EU-Nigeria political dialogue and cooperation are mutually complementary, thus the fight against corruption and human rights abuses are very important subjects in the agenda for dialogue as well as for support under the EDF.
