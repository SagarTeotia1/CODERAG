Question for written answer E-4058/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Liam Aylward (ALDE) (10 June 2010) Subject: Creation of synthetic life A team of experts, led by Craig Venter, recently succeeded in creating a synthetic cell, heralded as the first ever self-replicating species directly created by man. As with all new technologies, whether justified or not, some people will see this discovery as a threat. Therefore we need to ensure that safety standards are adhered to and unambiguous information on any developments is readily available. What measures does the Commission intend to take in order to introduce legislation on safety and ethics in this area? What kind of leadership can the European Union deliver on issues of this nature?
