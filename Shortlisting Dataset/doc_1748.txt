Answer given by Mr Liikanen on behalf of the Commission (12 August 2003) The Commission is aware of concerns of the leather industry with regard to the impact of the future Community chemicals legislation (REACH). An Internet consultation on texts prepared by the services most directly concerned, namely, Directorates General Enterprise and Environment was recently concluded. The comments received, including those of the leather industry in relation to higher costs and potential distortions of competition, will be taken into account by the Commission in the adoption of its proposal.
