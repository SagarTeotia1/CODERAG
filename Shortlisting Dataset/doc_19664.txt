the UN Special Rapporteur and to accept his request to visit Burma; 13. Calls on countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with which Burma enjoys close economic and political relations to put heavy pressure on the Burmese authorities to bring about democratic change; 14. Is of the opinion that the EU's clearly defined and targeted sanctions against the Burmese junta, although broadened after the September 2007 events with the introduction of an embargo on further sectors of the economy, are still having only a limited effect on the regime, thus falling short of the objectives sought; reiterates, therefore, its call on the Council to take further steps and effectively prevent the Burmese junta from accessing EU funding; calls on the Council and the Member States to monitor closely, and ensure the effective application of, the targeted sanctions; 15. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the EU Special Envoy for Burma, the Burmese State Peace and Development Council, the governments of the ASEAN and the member states of the Asia-Europe Meeting, the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus, Aung San Suu Kyi, the NLD, the UN Secretary-General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Commission Special Rapporteur for Burma.
