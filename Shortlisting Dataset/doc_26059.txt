come entirely from the ninth theme of FP7. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) provides customer-driven scientific and technical support for EU policy making, ensuring support to the implementation and monitoring of existing policies and responding to new policy demands. In the area of internal security, the JRC will support EU policies in the areas of justice, freedom and security, and customs. In the area of global security, the JRC will support the decision-making in the framework of external relations instruments (development cooperation, trade and instruments responding to crises). These security activities will be carried out by means of direct actions by the JRC under FP7.
