Question for written answer E-004301/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 David-Maria Sassoli (S&D) (5 May 2011) Subject: Libya: protection and recovery of civilians in the Mediterranean The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that, to flee the Libyan conflict, more than 500 000 individuals have crossed land borders into neighbouring countries, mainly to go back home. United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 1973 (2011) authorises Member States to take all necessary measures to protect civilians, this therefore being the main aim of operations in the area. Four thousand individuals, mainly Horn of Africa and sub-Saharan refugees, have fled Libya and reached Italy across the Mediterranean, with more likely to follow. According to the UNHCR, an estimated 250 people died after the dramatic capsize of a refugee boat from Libya on 6 April. Three boats have left Libya in the last three weeks and are still reportedly missing at sea, meaning that at least 800 people have left Libya and not arrived at their destination. NATO, which is conducting the maritime embargo of Libya known as Operation Unified Protector, has a significant naval force patrolling the area, to which many Member States are contributing. Many Member States are taking part in the operations. Rescue at sea is a duty laid down by IMO international convention. The right to seek asylum is a fundamental right enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Does the Commission intend to urgently put in place more effective operational mechanisms for rescue at sea in the Mediterranean, endorsing Member States' efforts through Frontex coordination? Does not the Commission consider that any overcrowded boat leaving Libya these days should be considered a boat in distress at sea?
