WRITTEN QUESTION E-0011/09 by Philip Claeys (NI) to the Commission (14 January 2009) Subject: Study shows anti-secularist pressure in Turkey A report by the Open Society Institute and Bosphorus University, Being Different in Turkey, shows that non‑Muslims in Turkey are becoming increasingly isolated. This is happening both at the political and socio‑economic level and is being felt in the daily lives of many people. There is pressure, for example, to wear the veil, to fast during Ramadan or to close shops during evening prayers. Is the Commission aware of the subject matter of the report? Is the subject matter of the report being discussed with the Turkish authorities?
