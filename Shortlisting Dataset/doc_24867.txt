Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (27 May 2005) The Commission acknowledges the value of regional integration initiatives among parties who have decided to work together and which are compatible with their internationl obligations and aspirations. The Commission fully rejects the creation of new dividing lines or new spheres of influence. Belarus and Russia have signed several integration treaties (including a ‘Treaty on a Union State’ in 1999), which set up joint institutions. Many bilateral treaty provisions are not implemented, especially those concerning legislative approximation in the economic sphere. However, the two countries have removed tariff and quantitative barriers to trade and have made significant progress towards a customs union. Plans for monetary union have been postponed until 2006 due to continued disagreement on currency emission. At their recent meeting in April 2005, Presidents Putin and Lukashenko agreed to strengthen both economic and political cooperation within the Union. In accordance with the Council conclusions of 22 and 23 November 2004, the Commission recalls that the European Union (EU) is willing to deepen its relationship with Belarus, including within the European neighbourhood policy (ENP), once the Belarussian authorities clearly demonstrate their willingness to respect democratic values and the rule of law. The Commission is continuing and intensifying its efforts to support the needs of the population and democratisation in Belarus, and thereby to meet the challenges arising from the self-isolation of Belarus.
