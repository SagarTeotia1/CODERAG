to allow a democratic transition to take place in Syria; 7. Reiterates its call for an independent, transparent and effective investigation into the killings, arrests, arbitrary detention and alleged forced disappearances and instances of torture by the Syrian security forces in order to ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are held to account by the international community; 8. Welcomes the adoption by the Council on 13 October 2011 of new restrictive measures against the Syrian regime as well as the Council conclusions of 10 October which reiterated the EU’s determination to pursue actively its current policy on Syria, including through its targeted sanctions against the Syrian regime and those supporting it, until there is an end to the unacceptable violence and decisive progress towards a genuine, peaceful and democratic transition addressing the legitimate demands of the Syrian people; calls, in this context, for further sanctions that target the regime but minimise the negative impacts on the living conditions of the population; 9. Regrets deeply that the UN Security Council (UNSC) has not been able to give adequate answer to the ongoing brutal events in Syria so far; expresses its full support for the efforts of the EU and its Member States to proceed with a UNSC resolution condemning the use of lethal force by the Syrian regime and calling for an end to this use of force, and to put in place sanctions for failure to do so; urges all members of the UNSC to assume their responsibilities in relation to the situation in Syria; 10. Welcomes the positive statement made by the Council on the efforts of the Syrian political opposition to establish a united platform; reiterates its call to HR/VP Ashton, the Council and the Commission to further encourage and support the emergence of organised Syrian democratic opposition forces both within and outside the country; 11. Stresses the importance of the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Syria, and notably the freedom of religion, belief, conscience and thought; expresses, in this context, its support to the Christian community in the country and, at the same time, encourages this community to play a positive and constructive role in the ongoing events in Syria; encourages also Syrian opposition forces to declare or reconfirm their commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms, and notably the freedom of religion, belief, conscience and thought; 12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Government and Parliament of Egypt and the Government and Parliament of Syria.
