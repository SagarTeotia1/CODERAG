Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (26 April 2011) The Commission contacted the authorities of the United States of America in relation to the open letter of Dr Don Huber to the US Department of Agriculture, referred to by the Honourable Member and which is available on the Internet. The US authorities noted that, as of 30 March 2011, they had not received officially this letter. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it considers objective data and peer review to be important parts of the scientific process and would be willing to assess any data, documented research, or evidence otherwise, should Dr Huber provide it, to support his postulation of a newly discovered pathogen possibly linked with a Roundup resistant gene or Roundup herbicide. Should this evidence become available, the Commission would also request EFSA European Food Safety Authority. to perform a thorough scientific assessment of it and would take appropriate action if necessary. The Commission does not comment on the specific information mentioned by the Honourable Member, which relates to internal matters of the United States of Amercia.
