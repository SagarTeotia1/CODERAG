Welcomes the Commission’s decision to revisit this issue by means of a Green Paper and a process of widespread consultation; calls on the Council and Commission, following this consultation process, to formulate a European economic migration policy incorporating the remarks of the European Parliament and national parliaments; 2. Emphasises the importance of ensuring that immigration takes place at a level which maintains the utmost respect for fundamental rights, which will result in increased public confidence; 3. Considers that economic migration is a positive human phenomenon, which has always promoted the development of civilisations and cultural and technological exchanges; 4.

Considers that the management of economic migration in the Union should be based on an overall rather than sectoral approach and that the management of migratory movements should not only serve labour market demand but be based on the reception and integration policies pursued by Member States and should respect the objectives of co-development; 9. Calls on the receiving Member States and the migrants' States of origin to conclude agreements to guarantee transfers of entitlements acquired in either country to the other regarding length of service in skilled employment or social security; 10. Calls on the Commission, in designing a European framework for economic migration, to take into account the different policies and experiences existing in the Member States, and stresses that a
