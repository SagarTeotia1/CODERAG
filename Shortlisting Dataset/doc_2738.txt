Treaty. British and Irish speakers Vicky FORD (ECR, UK) congratulated the Swedish Presidency for prioritising economic challenges. Regulatory clarity is vital, she said. These industries are, as we all know, global industries. The capital, the talent and the individual enterprises are highly fluid. They need workable and defined legislative timetables, prioritisation of legislation and proper consultation. Ms Ford welcomed the Presidency's commitment to work alongside the G20, because, she said, if we get out of step and go unilateral in the EU we risk not only putting borrowers and investors at a competitive disadvantage but also causing industries to relocate. Proinsias De ROSSA (S&D, IE) said that the system is broken and must be deeply reformed. More integration is needed of social and economic and climate and energy policies, with the objective of job retention and creation with decent living and working conditions. A recommitment to the Millennium Development Goals is needed and Mr De Rossa regretted that there was no call for an immediate lifting of the siege of Gaza or an indication to re energise the search for peace alongside President Obama. In relation to the Lisbon Treaty, Pat the Cope GALLAGHER (ALDE, IE) said that is it now the duty of all of us to ensure that there will be a yes vote. If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, every Member State will be in a position to nominate a member to the European Commission and this is a direct response to a concern expressed in Ireland. 20090714IPR58191 Swedish Presidency of the European Union Speech by Prime Minister Reinfeldt before the European Parliament 15 July 2009 in Strasbourg Verbatim reports (click on 15 July) audio, 29:44 - Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt (EN) audio, 29:44 - Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt (OR) audio, 33:53 - Political group statements (EN) audio, 33:53 - Political group statements (OR) audio, 29:46 - Press Conference (EN) audio, 29:46 -Press Conference (OR) EN 1 PHOTO 20090709PHT57848.jpg EN 2 LINK http://www.eu2009.se/ EN 3 LINK http://www.eu2009.se/polopoly_fs/1.9315!menu/standard/file/Speech%20by%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20before%20the%20European%20Parliament%2015%20July%202009%20in%20Strasbourg.pdf EN 4 LINK /activities/plenary/ta/calendar.do?language=EN EN 5 MULTIMEDIA 20090715MLT58289.asf EN 6 MULTIMEDIA 20090715MLT58295.asf EN 7 MULTIMEDIA 20090715MLT58293.asf EN 8 MULTIMEDIA 20090715MLT58291.asf EN 9 MULTIMEDIA 20090715MLT58299.asf EN 10 MULTIMEDIA 20090715MLT58297.asf -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
