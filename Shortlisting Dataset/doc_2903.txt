Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (19 September 2006) Ireland has put into effect the national legislation and administrative provisions necessary for compliance with Council Directives 77/391/EEC Council Directive 77/391/EEC of 17 May 1977 introducing Community measures for the eradication of brucellosis, tuberculosis and leucosis in cattle, OJ L 14, 13.6.1977. and 78/52/EEC Council Directive 78/52/EEC of 13 December 1977 establishing the Community criteria for national plans for the accelerated eradication of brucellosis, tuberculosis and enzootic leukosis in cattle, OJ L 015, 19.1.1978. concerning the introduction of Community measures for the eradication of bovine brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis and enzootic bovine leucosis. These two Council Directives, that have been surpassed as regards the Community financial contribution to these eradication programmes by Council Decision 90/424/EEC 90/424/EEC: Council Decision of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field, OJ L 224, 18.8.1990. on expenditure on the veterinary field, oblige Member States where the cattle populations are infected with these diseases to draw up plans for accelerating the eradication of these diseases. Ireland has implemented bovine brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis and enzootic bovine leucosis eradication programmes and has, for certain years, received a Community financial contribution in accordance to Article 24 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC. The financial contribution by the Community has always been at the rate of 50 % of the costs to be incurred by each Member State, in particular for the cost of the adequate compensation paid to the owners for their losses due to the slaughter of animals subject to these programmes. As regards the Commission monitoring of the progress towards eradication and the implementation of the testing for tuberculosis and brucellosis, Ireland has met its obligations and forwarded the preliminary technical and financial evaluation of the co-financed programmes, intermediate reports and final reports on the technical execution of the programmes in accordance to relevant Community legislation (Commission Decision 2002/677/EC laying down standard reporting requirements for programmes of eradication and control of animal diseases co-financed by the Community and repealing Decision 2000/322/EC 2002/677/EC: Commission decision of 22 August 2002 laying down standard reporting requirements for programmes of eradication and control of animal diseases co-financed by the Community and repealing Decision 2000/322/EC (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 3103), OJ L 229, 27.8.2002. ).
