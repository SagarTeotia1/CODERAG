all simplification initiatives comply fully with the principles and conditions outlined in its resolution of 16 May 2006 on the strategy for simplification of the regulatory environment; 73. Suggests that a 25% reduction in the administrative burden on the Member States would lead to an increase in real GDP of 1 to 1.4%; urges all Member States to set quantitative and qualitative targets in this area and to contribute, in the framework of better transposition in particular, to simplifying existing regulations and to introduce impact assessment procedures, whilst establishing consultation and complaint procedures with relevant stakeholders; underlines the important role of national parliaments and the need for cooperation structures in this context; Early and better transposition 74. Calls, in the interests of increasing transparency and fostering a better understanding of the Lisbon strategy and its implementation, for the development of a common and coherent structure for NRPs, making for a better comparative analysis of the impact of the proposed actions at Member State level, as well as an open and constructive dialogue at European level on the progress achieved; supports the idea, in this respect, of establishing country-specific recommendations and a best practice ranking system on reform agendas in the different policy fields; calls on the Member States to draw up correlation tables and to communicate them to the European Commission; Improving Lisbon governance and national ownership 75. Stresses that the country-specific recommendations have to be discussed and adopted in Council in order to develop a real European framework, to strengthen the economic and employment coordination work and to foster greater national ownership; 76. Reiterates that we will not overcome our economic and employment problems without the active involvement of parliaments, at national and European level; supports the European Commission's request that Member States promote wider discussion of their NRPs and Implementation Reports, including national recommendations, with their national parliaments and establish closer links between NRPs and national budget debates; 77. Encourages the Commission to introduce a form of benchmarking surveillance, using structural policy indicators with a clearly identified link to economic and employment performance and indicators underpinning the structural surveillance exercise, taking into account policies that stimulate innovation and job creation; 78. Stresses the need for a more effective role for 'Mr/Mrs Lisbon' in all Member States, at the highest political level, with a view to convincing national decision-makers to improve the policy-mix-approach of this reform agenda at both national and European level; 79. Points out that it is the guiding role of the Spring European Council to establish the growth and employment reform agenda for the European Union; calls on the European Council to ensure the equal involvement of all the Council formations concerned; 80. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.
