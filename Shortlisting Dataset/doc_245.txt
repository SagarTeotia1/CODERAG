WRITTEN QUESTION E-0609/06 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (16 February 2006) Subject: Ban on an edition of a Spanish newspaper in Morocco On 2 February the Moroccan Government banned the distribution in the country of that day’s edition of the Spanish daily El Mundo . Under the headline ‘Mohamed VI imprisoned his mother for taking a lover’ El Mundo published an interview with a former agent of the Moroccan secret services. The title of the interview was merely the transcription of a statement made by a person who identified himself by name. The interview was signed by Ali Lmrabet, a Moroccan citizen currently residing in Spain, who works as a correspondent for El Mundo in the Maghreb region. He has seen his publications banned by the Moroccan authorities because they allegedly insult the monarchy, has served time in prison and is currently banned from working as a journalist in Morocco for a period of 10 years. The case of Ali Lmrabet has been widely publicised internationally and organisations such as Reporters without Frontiers claim that the penalties imposed on him are an attack on freedom of expression. Reporters without Frontiers reiterated its condemnation when distribution of El Mundo was banned. What steps does the Commission plan to take in response to the Moroccan ban on the distribution of a newspaper published in a Member State of the European Union?
