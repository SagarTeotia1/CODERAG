the final declaration of the 2009 World Summit on Food Security neither sufficiently analyses the reasons for the failure to eradicate hunger, nor does it make concrete proposals on how to step up the fight against hunger; whereas, according to the FAO, an investment of EUR 30 billion per year would be enough to ensure food security for a world population which will reach 9 billion by 2050, C. whereas the European Union remains a major food producer, but is also a major importer of agricultural products, falling significantly short of self-sufficiency in numerous agricultural commodities; whereas the rise in the prices of animal feed is increasing production costs, with the risk that output of stockfarming products will fall, D. whereas dramatic fluctuations in commodity prices may become a more pronounced and regular feature of the global market; whereas higher food prices do not automatically translate into higher farm incomes, mainly due to the speed at which farm-input costs increase and the growing divergence between producer and consumer prices, E. whereas world food stocks have fallen to critically low levels, from one year’s supply of food in stock after the Second World War to just 57 days’ stock in 2007 and only 40 days’ in 2008, F. whereas depleted stocks, even in the EU, have an adverse effect on the emergency food programme, which has, at present, less food to distribute; whereas this problem and the global food-price crisis have had the immediate and serious consequence of increasing the number of hungry people in the world to 1 billion in 2009 according to the FAO, meaning that one person in six is currently undernourished and suffering from chronic hunger, G. whereas more than 40 million people die of hunger and poverty every year, including one child every six seconds; whereas these developments have sparked riots and unrest throughout the world, further destabilising countries and regions around the globe; whereas at the World Food Summit in 1996 representatives from 185 countries committed themselves to cutting the number of hungry people by half by 2015; and whereas family farmers, herders and rural workers account for more than half the world's population and are the primary victims of hunger, H. whereas climate change is having a serious impact on farming, for example by reducing crop yields because of the water shortages affecting local agricultural activities in the poorest countries, I. whereas agriculture provides employment and a livelihood for more than 70 % of the labour force in developing countries, and for more than 80 % in many African countries, and, as a consequence, rural development policies are essential in order to tackle poverty and hunger effectively; whereas the World Bank estimates that growth in the agricultural sector is twice as effective at reducing poverty as growth in other sectors, J. whereas the European Union provides more than 50 % of all development aid worldwide, including the Member States' contributions; a fact confirmed by the current contribution through EC instruments (around EUR 1.8 billion: EUR 1 billion through the new facility for rapid response to soaring
