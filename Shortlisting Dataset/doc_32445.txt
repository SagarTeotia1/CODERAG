Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (17 September 2010) A programme such as Erasmus allows 200000 students a year to study and take part in placements abroad. The vast majority of European universities participate in the programme, and over 2.2 million students have taken part since it was launched in 1987. The Commission does not believe that the Court of Justice's judgment in Case C‑73/08 ( Nicolas Bressol and others v Gouvernement de la Communauté française ) can have any impact on the participation of medical and paramedical students in the Commission’s Lifelong Learning Programme for the following reasons: 1. The Bressol judgment refers to the possible incompatibility of national legislation with the principle of non-discrimination laid down in Article 18 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, whereas the action programme in the field of lifelong learning is governed by a specific decision adopted at European Union level, namely Decision No 1720/2006/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council OJ L 327, 24.11.2006 . . 2. Student mobility under the above EU programme is subsidised by European Union funds, in accordance with the abovementioned Decision. Article 23 of the decision provides in particular that not less than 80 % of the amount allocated to the Erasmus programme shall be devoted to support for mobility of individuals participating in lifelong learning.
