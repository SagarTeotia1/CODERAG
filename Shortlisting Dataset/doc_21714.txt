Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2006) Council Directive 79/7/EEC Council directive of 19 December 1978 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security; OJ L 6, 10.1.1979. prohibits direct and indirect discrimination based on sex in relation to statutory social security schemes provided for the working population i.e. workers, self-employed persons, and persons seeking employment. However, survivors’ benefits and family benefits are excluded from the scope of the directive. Article 141 of the EC Treaty guarantees the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. According to the case law of the European Court of Justice, an occupational pension paid by an employer to a former employee by reason of the employment relationship between them constitutes pay within the meaning of Article 141. The Court has also held that a survivor's pension, in particular a spouse's pension, provided by an occupational pension scheme falls within the scope of Article 141 as it is paid to the survivor by reason of the employment relationship between the employer and the survivor's spouse i.e. the former employee. Furthermore, Council Directive 86/378/EEC Council directive of 24 July 1986 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes; OJ L 225, 12.8.1986. as amended by Directive 96/97/EC Council Directive 96/97/EC of 20 December 1996 amending Directive 86/378/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes; Official Journal L 46, 17.2.1997. prohibits direct and indirect discrimination based on sex in relation to occupational social security schemes. The Commission is currently in the process of examining the compatibility of Article 32, paragraph 1(b) of the Greek code on civil and military conventions with the above Community law and will be in further contact with the Honourable Member as soon as possible.
