to the act of distribution of a copyright protected good. For instance, in most Union Member States, authors enjoy a right of remuneration for the copying of their works for private use. This remuneration is in general raised on blank carriers of audio or audio-visual material and/or on recording equipment and has normally to be paid by the manufacturer or the importer of such products. The remuneration schemes have to be in line with the general principles set out in Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC on copyright in the information society, which Member States have to implement by December 2002. This Directive allows Member States to provide for exceptions to the rights regarding private copying, including remuneration schemes. However, as these schemes have not been harmonised at Union level, the exact conditions of such schemes may differ from one Member State to another. The remuneration is in general only due if the sale of the products in question will take place in the territory of the Member State but not if it is destined for export.
