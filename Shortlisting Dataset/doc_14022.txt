Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (30 June 2011) The Green Paper on online gambling in the internal market, adopted by the Commission on 24 March 2011, seeks to canvass views from all interested parties in order to get a better understanding of the specific issues arising from the rapid development of online gambling offers in the EU. The information and data collected at the end of the consultation process will be thoroughly assessed by the Commission with a view to determine the need for, and as the case may be the nature of, any follow-up action. The above is equally true with regard to collection of data and information about corruption practices, as well as about existing or possible anti-corruption measures. The Commission does not currently have an exhaustive list of all measures in place in the EU Member States with a view to prevent or fight match fixing and other corruption practices. With regard to corruption in sports betting, Section 2.3.2 of the Green Paper on public order/prevention of fraud raises questions relating to match fixing (questions 30-32). In addition, the issue of match fixing is touched upon in Section 2.4 dealing with enforcement. Match fixing is a phenomenon that very often goes hand in hand with corruption and which has been identified by the sports movement as one of the most serious threats to the integrity of sport competitions. Therefore, the Commission does address this particular issue in the Green Paper. Furthermore, the Commission has organised an expert workshop on sports integrity with focus on match fixing in order to benefit from the knowledge and experience of selected experts in the field. The contributions received within the consultation process should determine the need for and form of any EU follow-up action in this field.
