Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (25 October 2010) The Commission received on 21 September 2010 a notification from the Italian telecoms regulator, AGCOM, including a draft regulatory decision on the price for local loop unbundling services (LLU) to which the Honourable Member refers. The Commission has now — under the so-called Article 7 Consultation Mechanism established by the framework Directive — one month to assess whether this measure is justified and proportionate given the identified competition problems. By 21 October 2010, the Commission may make comments on AGCOM's regulatory proposal. At the present moment, however, it is too early for the Commission to comment on the substance of AGCOM's proposal. The use of an LRIC costing methodology as such seems appropriate and is in line with the regulatory practices of two thirds of all telecoms regulators in the EU. However, the Commission will look into the question of how the methodology is applied by AGCOM. Inany event, the price for LLU may also depend on a number of factors linked to the network topology in a given country. In accordance with the Digital Agenda for Europe, the Commission will provide guidance on key regulatory concepts under the electronic communications rules, in particular on costing methodologies. In this way, the Commission is seeking to achieve consistency across Europe in the regulation of prices for key access products which are offered by dominant operators and at the same time needed by alternative operators to serve their own customers. In this context, the Commission will also seek to provide guidance on how best to determine the LLU price, a matter on which the Commission intends to work closely with BEREC (the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications).
