Question for written answer E-5282/2010 to the Council Rule 117 David Martin (S&D) (8 July 2010) Subject: Gojra communal violence in Pakistan In July-August 2009, an accusation under Pakistan’s ‘blasphemy laws’ triggered Islamist violence against Christians in Gojra and Korian, Punjab, leaving eight dead and at least 100 houses destroyed. A case was later filed against a large number of people implicated in these attacks; however, the Christian victims and other witnesses associated with the case are now living in hiding. Some have even fled the area due to an increase in targeted threats and aggression occurring since the release of key defendants on bail. These defendants continue to wield significant influence in the area, which local police are reportedly failing to curb. There is a significant risk that justice will not be done for the victims of the Gojra violence, leaving perpetrators free to carry out further anti-minority attacks in the future and perpetuating the pattern of impunity that has plagued past blasphemy-related atrocities, such as the destruction of the village of Shantinagar in 1997. The European Parliament resolution passed on 20 May 2010 ( P7_TA(2010)0194 ) recalled ‘the Commission's repeated statement, …, that it is closely following the Government of Pakistan's response to the mob violence triggered by blasphemy accusations in Gojra and Korian’ and called on the Commission to ‘request details of tangible progress made, particularly with regard to bringing the culprits to justice’. What action is the Council undertaking to monitor the Government of Pakistan’s response robustly and to ensure that this case is not allowed to disappear from the State agenda?
