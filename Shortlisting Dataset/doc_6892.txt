Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2007) The Commission is following closely the case of the women's rights activists mentioned by the Honourable Member. It has indeed received information from ‘Frontline’, a highly respected non-governmental organisation supporting Human Rights Defenders throughout the world. Unfortunately, the Commission is not in a position to attend these trials because it has no delegation in Iran. In close coordination with all EU partners, the Commission continues to focus on these cases. It calls on the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to fully respect the right to freedom of expression and of freedom of association, as enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
