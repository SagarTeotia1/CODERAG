Rule 110a Procedure without amendment and debate 1. Any legislative proposal (first reading) and any non-legislative motion for a resolution adopted in committee with fewer than one-tenth of the members of the committee voting against, shall be placed on the draft agenda of Parliament for vote without amendment. The item shall then be subject to a single vote unless, before the drawing up of the final draft agenda, political groups or individual Members who together constitute one-tenth of the Members of Parliament have requested in writing that the item be open to amendment, in which case the President shall fix a deadline for tabling amendments. 2. Items placed on the final draft agenda for vote without amendment shall also be without debate unless Parliament, when adopting its agenda at the start of a part-session, decides otherwise on a proposal of the Conference of Presidents, or if requested by a political group or at least thirty-two Members. 3. When drawing up the final draft agenda of a part-session, the Conference of Presidents may propose that other items be taken without amendment or without debate. When adopting its agenda, Parliament may not accept any such proposal if a political group or at least thirty-two Members have tabled their opposition in writing at least one hour before the opening of the part-session. 4. When an item is taken without debate, the rapporteur or the Committee chair may make a statement of not more than two minutes immediately prior to the vote.
