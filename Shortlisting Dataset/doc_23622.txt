Owing to their geographical specificity, they face significant problems which prevent their further development: one of these problems is energy. On the basis of the objectives set by the Lisbon Strategy, the energy issue in these regions should be addressed by integrated policies and long-term energy plans. In view of the recent blackout in Crete and other similar events on other European islands, will the Commission say: Does it plan to take additional measures to ensure the safety of energy supplies and the management and production of energy, thereby creating conditions for sustainable and balanced regional development on the islands of Europe?
