Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2012) The Commission is aware of the impact on households and businesses of the tax measures implemented by Greece in the last quarter of 2011. As the Commission stated in the latest Compliance Report http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2011/op87_en.htm , the adoption of additional tax measures in 2011 aimed at meeting the fiscal deficit targets would have tested many taxpayers’ liquidity constraints and not bring in much revenue. In the same vein, the Commission has also been of the view that the additional fiscal consolidation measures which are necessary to reduce the Greek Government deficit should focus mainly on expenditure cuts rather than on increasing tax rates. Outside consolidation efforts, the broadening of tax bases (which could allow some cuts in tax rates) and the fight against tax evasion are also suitable to make the tax system fairer.
