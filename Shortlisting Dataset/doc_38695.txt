growth in other sectors, J. whereas the European Union provides more than 50 % of all development aid worldwide, including the Member States' contributions; a fact confirmed by the current contribution through EC instruments (around EUR 1.8 billion: EUR 1 billion through the new facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries and the rest through currently available development and humanitarian aid instruments), K. whereas the proportion of deforested land and agricultural resources used for the production of animal feed, meat and biomass for agro-fuels has grown, contributing considerably to worldwide speculation in agricultural commodities, 1. Stresses that the number of people suffering from hunger and poverty now exceeds 1 billion and that this is an unacceptable blight on the lives of one-sixth of the world’s population; notes that the effects of longstanding underinvestment in food security, agriculture and rural development have recently been further exacerbated by food, financial and economic crises, among other factors, and that the overall efforts have so far fallen short of achieving the Millennium Development Goals; notes that collectively steps need to be taken to reverse this trend and gradually make the right to adequate food a reality in the context of national food security; 2.
