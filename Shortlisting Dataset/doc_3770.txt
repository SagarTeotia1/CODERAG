ORAL QUESTION H-0865/07 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Rumiana Jeleva to the Commission Subject: Pollution of the Black Sea The DABLAS Task Force was set up in November 2001 with the aim of providing a platform for cooperation on protection of the Danube and Black Sea. The efforts of the DABLAS Task Force are targeted towards the following beneficiary countries: Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Croatia. According to experts in the field, about 50% of the pollution of the Black Sea is caused by the Danube, but the river basins of the Dnieper and Dniester rivers, which flow directly into the sea, each cause about 20 per cent of the water contamination. What measures are being taken by the Commission to prevent environmental pollution caused by the Dniester and Dnieper river basins and the other rivers flowing directly into the Black Sea, and will the DABLAS initiative be replicated to cover them?
