step towards visa-free travel as a long-term prospect; calls for further cooperation on illegal immigration, improved checks on identity documents and better information exchange on terrorism and organised crime; emphasises that the Council and the Commission must ensure that Russia complies with all the conditions set in any negotiated agreement on the elimination of visas between the two sides, so as to prevent any breach of security in Europe; 21. Points out that Russia, which last year changed its visa rules and ceased issuing one-year multiple-entry business visas that many European workers had previously used, could face an exodus of EU managers and workers unless it changes the new rules and reduces the onerous red tape required to obtain visas and work permits; 22. Welcomes the stepping-up of EU-Russia cooperation in space within the framework of the Tripartite Space Dialogue set up in March 2006 between the Commission, the European Space Agency and Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency), encompassing space applications (satellite navigation, earth observation and satellite communications), access to space (launchers and future space transportation systems), space science and space technology development; notes that, within the common economic space, cooperation in space has been identified as a priority sector; 23. Calls for participation by the Russian Federation in the process of building European research infrastructures supported within the European Community Framework Programmes; considers that such an incentive would permit efficient utilisation and further development of substantial Russian human and financial resources in the area of research, development and innovation, and would thus be beneficial for both Europe and Russia; 24. Appeals to the Governments of Russia and the United States to intensify the discussions on defence and security issues directly or indirectly involving the EU Member States; urges the governments of both states fully to involve the EU and its Member States in those discussions and to refrain from any steps or decisions which might be seen as a threat to peace and stability on the European continent; 25. Calls on the Russian Government – together with the European Union and the other members of the Contact Group for Kosovo – to make a positive contribution to finding a sustainable political solution for the future of Kosovo and to the further enhancement of the stability of the Western Balkans; 26. Calls on Russia not to oppose the deployment of the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX KOSOVO Council Joint Action 2008/124/CFSP of 4 February 2008 (OJ L 42, 16.2.2008, p. 92). ), as well as to fully support the OSCE and confirm its mandate in order to allow for the full implementation of all the guarantees provided for in the Kosovo Constitution and the commitments by the Kosovo authorities as regards the institutional decentralisation and protection of the non-majority communities and of the cultural and architectural heritage; 27. Calls on the Council and the Commission to pursue joint initiatives with the Russian Government aimed at strengthening security and stability in the common neighbourhood, in particular by means of enhanced dialogue on the establishment of democracy in Belarus and
