Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2011) The Commission is aware of the value of independent credit ratings and the problems caused by potential conflicts of interest within the CRAs, specifically when they also carry out consultancy and advisory services. Therefore, the existing Credit Rating Agencies (CRA) Regulation Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit rating agencies of 16 September 2009, OJ L 302, 17.11.2009 (also called: CRA I), as amended by Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011, OJ L 145/30, 31.5.2011 (also called: CRA II). prohibits CRAs from providing consultancy or advisory services to the rated entity or a related third party Cf. Article 6 para. 2, and Annex I, section B, point 4 of the CRA I as amended by CRA II. . Since 1 July 2011, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has been granted comprehensive supervisory powers over credit rating agencies operating in the EU Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of 24 November 2010. , including the right to impose penalty payments and sanctions in case a credit rating agency breaches the provisions of the CRA Regulation. To the Commission's knowledge, no complaints have been received by ESMA so far. On 15 November 2011 the Commission adopted a proposal COM(2011)747/2, amending the existing CRA-Regulation. Article 35a of this proposal contains the conditions under which the civil liability of credit rating agencies could be invoked. It is proposed that credit rating agencies should be held liable if they infringe intentionally or with gross negligence a requirement of the CRA Regulation. National courts would be competent to decide on any claims for damage based on the proposed provision. The text has been submitted to the Parliament and the Council. The Commission hopes that the co-legislators will conclude swiftly on the file during 2012.
