Question for written answer E-001918/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Vincenzo Iovine (ALDE) (3 March 2011) Subject: Competence of the WHO as regards price and tax policies relating to tobacco products In November 2010, at the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, new measures were adopted to combat smoking. These include restrictions on the use of flavouring agents in tobacco products, which would place European producers (of Oriental and Burley tobacco) seriously at risk. The fourth session of the Conference also examined a report on price and tax policies relating to tobacco products and set up a working group to draw up guidelines for the implementation of the measures in question. As the European Union is one of the contracting parties to the framework Convention, it is legally bound by the provisions thereof. In the light of the foregoing, 1. Does the Commission believe that approving the Convention contravenes the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade? 2. Does the Commission believe that the WHO is competent to regulate price and tax policies relating to tobacco products? 3. Does the Commission consider that tobacco growing should be regarded in the same way as any other agricultural activity and that its economic and social implications should be taken into account, given that, in addition to creating local employment, it provides work for people living in disadvantaged circumstances and helps keep many rural communities alive?
