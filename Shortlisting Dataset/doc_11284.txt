every action having a considerable financial impact and every major action to be undertaken; recommends that, when the benefit is likely to be insignificant, the Commission explain why it has come to its conclusion; notes that it is sensible to involve the Member States in the assessment of whether a measure should be implemented; 34. Draws attention to the role which insurance companies may have in reducing road accidents in commercial traffic; differential premiums are an appropriate way of motivating haulage firms to prioritise road safety and thereby to reduce the number of road accidents; 35. Regrets that the Third Road Safety Action Programme does not particularly highlight the road safety problems in densely populated areas and that the ways in which public transport can contribute to reducing the number of road accidents is not mentioned; is convinced of the enormous potential impact of the sharing of best practice for urban areas all over Europe; calls for strengthened action for spreading best practices and for intensifying research; in this context, underlines the major contribution to road safety of developing common standards concerning road geometry, infrastructure design and traffic signs; 36. Is aware that many promising technologies cannot be introduced immediately; calls, therefore, on the Commission to propose a list of priority areas in which technological research should be focused as well as a road map for their introduction; insists that both the priority list and the road map should be established only when a thorough cost-benefit analysis has been carried out; calls for these priority activities to cover the short, medium and long term and to be seamlessly included in the Verona process; 37. Considers that technologies such as telematics offer, in the long term, the possibility of eliminating fatal accidents almost totally; calls, therefore, for intensive research and cooperation between all stakeholders in order to promote the speedy introduction of the most promising technologies; 38. Is aware of the fact that introducing many new technologies may prove to be costly and that new car buyers are not always able or willing to pay the full cost even though the socio-economic cost savings would be higher than the added cost to the vehicle; calls on the Commission to define, together with the Member States (and at the same time safeguarding the functioning of the internal market), fiscal and other incentives to accelerate the introduction of effective solutions and enhance their introduction through a reformed and more exhaustive EuroNCAP; 39. Is of the view that out of the huge selection of technologies the following solutions should receive particular attention and be considered: - Seat belt reminders and advanced restraint systems: notes that in Sweden, 95% of car occupants wear their seatbelts while half of all those killed were not wearing their seatbelts; supports the compulsory fitting of seat belt reminders for driver seats in all new vehicles with due exceptions for urban public transport, and the extension of such reminders to passenger seats; - Electronic Stability Control (ESC): points out that worldwide research is unanimous of the significant life saving potential of vehicle
