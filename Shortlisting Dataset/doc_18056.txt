WRITTEN QUESTION E-0121/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (20 January 2005) Subject: Earthquake in Southeast Asia The recent earthquake in Southeast Asia has highlighted the absence of international cooperation in field of early warning systems, especially in dealing with extreme ocean phenomena. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO), acting within the framework of the United Nations, has been endeavouring to create an international monitoring system (IMS) incorporating pressure sensors on the ocean floor (hydrophone stations), and also an extensive worldwide seismological network. Will the Commission say what contribution the European Union has made to the above UN network? Does any economic or scientific cooperation exist and, if so, in which precise sectors? Has the EU made any attempts of its own to establish regional hydroacoustic early warning systems in European waters through cooperation, for instance with Mediterranean Member States, backed by EU funding? If so, what level of funding has been earmarked for setting up and operating these systems? As far as marine seismological monitoring is concerned, does a network exist at EU level for measuring underwater seismic activity (anywhere in the Union) which is subsidised by the EU and, if so, what amount of funding does it receive?
