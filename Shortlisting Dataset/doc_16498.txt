Question for written answer E-001918/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 David Casa (PPE) (16 February 2012) Subject: Monitoring the EIB The European Investment Bank's activities in the EU's southern neighbourhood have come under criticism for financing public projects run by several of the regimes toppled by the Arab Spring. Many of the people surrounding former Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak have been implicated in corruption procedures related to the misuse of such financing. Has the Commission taken any action to ensure that the European Investment Bank takes stronger measures to make certain that its financing operations do not indirectly provide financial support to political figures that the EU is actively seeking to isolate?
