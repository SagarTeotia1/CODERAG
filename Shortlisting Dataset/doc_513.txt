WRITTEN QUESTION E-0923/09 by Margaritis Schinas (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (17 February 2009) Subject: Tackling US economic protectionism A decision by the US House of Representatives on reviving the economy provides that only industrial products produced exclusively in the US may be used in public works projects. The above decision is in conjunction with the recent imposition of supplementary levies on agricultural products, such as the French cheese Roquefort. Is the Commission aware of these developments? What actions does the Commission intend to take to deal with US protectionism and at the same time protect and promote European products?
