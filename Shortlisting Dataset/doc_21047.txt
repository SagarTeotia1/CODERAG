Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2005) Research into the causes of breast cancer is being substantially supported as part of the ‘Combating cancer’ area of the thematic priority 1 ‘Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health’ within the sixth framework programme for research (FP6). As a result of this, four research projects dealing exclusively with research on the causes of breast cancer are currently being supported for a budget of EUR 17 million. These projects (of which a table is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament’s Secretariat) tackle, with a multidisciplinary approach, different issues relating to the causes of breast cancer, such as the genetic mechanisms involved, the pathways implicated in its development or the ways to prevent breast cancer in women known to be at high risk of developing the disease. Furthermore, several of the 43 cancer research projects of FP6 funded up to now, address other aspects of breast cancer research in a global context of improved knowledge on cancer. In its proposals for the seventh research framework programme COM(2005)119 final. and for the specific programme ‘Cooperation’ COM(2005)440 final. the Commission has, under the theme ‘Health’, set a priority for translational research in cancer. The Commission will continue to bear in mind the importance of breast cancer research in the implementation of the seventh framework programme for research.
