ORAL QUESTION H-0189/04 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Reino Paasilinna to the Commission Subject: Media concentration At its sitting of 20 November 2002 Parliament adopted a resolution on media concentration, in which it called on the Commission, among other things, to draw up a green paper by the end of 2003, assessing the development of new technology and new communications, the impact of mergers, alliances, and joint ventures in particular on the internal market and media pluralism, and the current legal position and future developments in both the Member States and the applicant countries. It also urged the Commission, within this parliamentary term, to consider what regulatory options might be used to safeguard freedom of expression and pluralism in the media and, in addition, to submit a proposal to enable the principle of media freedom to be established on a stronger basis in the Treaty. Why has the Commission done nothing to prevent media concentration, in spite of the calls from Parliament?
