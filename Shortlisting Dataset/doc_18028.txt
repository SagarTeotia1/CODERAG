Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (31 March 2009) Regarding the first question of the Honourable Member, the Commission does not have at its disposal information on the internal gas consumption in the Russian Federation for the precise relevant period (1 to 20 January 2009). Nevertheless, according to information received from the Central Dispatching Department of Fuel Energy Complex in the Russian Federation, the production of gas in Russia fell by 11.4 % in January 2009 (54.7 bcm) in comparison with January 2008 (61.2 bcm). This mostly concerns Gazprom whose production fell by 13.7 % in comparison with January 2008 and 6.1 % in comparison with December 2008, but other producers also had to reduce their output given lacking demand. This considerable decline can be directly attributed to the exceptional situation in January 2009 with the gas crisis. Regarding the second question, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the latest publication of the International Energy Agency (IEA) named ‘Natural gas information 2008’ where it is possible to establish a trend for the production of natural gas in Russia. It appears that Russian production experienced a steady growth of 2 % per year for the 2003‑06 period, production going form 617.78 bcm to 651.01 bcm. For 2007 (latest year of the report), the production stabilised and remained at 650.99 bcm. Moreover, according to the Russian Federal Statistics Service, Russia gas production in total for 2008 was up by 1.6 % from 2007. Regarding the third question of the Honourable Member, the main information sources for the future production volumes in the Russian Federation are the official Russian scenarios received by the Commission through the EU‑Russia Energy Dialogue and the assessments of independent organisations such as the IEA. According to Russian scenarios, the total production will grow steadily with gradual depletion of the big three natural gas fields in the Nadym-pur Tazov (N-P-T) region of Western Siberia (Urengoy, Yamburg and Medvezhe) and shifting to new fields, notably Yamal Bovanenkovo, Shtokman and Far East deposits. In the ‘Natural gas market review 2007’ IEA stated that ‘delays and cost overruns in the N-P-T region could leave the global gas balance looking clearly stretched before 2010, while slippage on such a major project as Yamal would have the same effect after 2010. In short, the level of investments that we see in Russia is inadequate to deliver the planned production on time’. Gazprom, the state monopoly, has announced that its gas production could fall by 7 % in 2009 and gas exports to Europe by 5-8 % in comparison with 2008. Gazprom has also lowered its forecast for gas production until 2020 (620 bcm instead of 650-670 bcm projected six months ago).
