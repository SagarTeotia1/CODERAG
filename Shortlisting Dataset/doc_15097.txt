WRITTEN QUESTION E-1395/10 by Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) to the Commission (11 March 2010) Subject: Preservation and enhancement of European cultural monuments in countries outside the EU The interaction of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula over the centuries has left behind, in all countries, monuments and buildings which bear witness to this link. In many cases, however, natural disasters, national and religious conflicts, lack of cultural education and inadequate resources have resulted either in the destruction or in poor or non-existent maintenance of those monuments. 1. What policies has the Commission drafted for the preservation, promotion and enhancement of cultural monuments which bear witness to the diversity and multiculturalism of Europe, even if they are situated in countries outside the European Union? 2. Does the Commission play an active role in protecting cultural monuments situated in countries outside the EU, such as the countries of the western Balkans and Turkey?
