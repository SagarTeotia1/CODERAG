Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (21 March 2007) The application of the precautionary principle is one of the objectives of the common fisheries policy. One of the consequences of this is that fisheries should not expand unless there is scientific evidence that the expansion of the fishery would be sustainable. In the case of the horse mackerel around the Azores, quota utilisation is typically very low. For example in 2005 catches were only 1 223 tonnes (t) compared with a total allowable catch (TAC) of 3 200t. There is no specific scientific advice showing that it would be sustainable to increase catches from recent current levels up to the level of the TAC of 3 200t. The Commission therefore proposed, in conformity with the precautionary principle, to adapt the TAC towards the level of real catches that have recently been taken from this stock. Such a reduction could have been brought about gradually, beginning with an initial 20 % reduction, with further reductions being made in following years as required. However, notwithstanding the Commission's proposal Council Regulation (EC) No 41/2007 of 21 December 2006 fixing for 2007 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required, OJ L 15, 20.1.2007. , the Council chose to maintain the TAC at 3 200t. The Commission would quite naturally have provided for the publication of the relevant scientific data and advice concerning this stock, as part of the published reports of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, were such advice or data available.
