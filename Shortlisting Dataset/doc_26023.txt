WRITTEN QUESTION P-6203/08 by Anne Van Lancker (PSE) to the Commission (12 November 2008) Subject: Social award criteria in public procurement directives Directives 2004/17/EC OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 1. and 2004/18/EC OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 114. coordinating public procurement procedures contain a list of criteria and characteristics to be used by the contracting authorities as a basis for awarding public procurement contracts (Article 55(1)(a) and Article 53(1)(a) respectively). This list of award criteria does not include any social considerations, whereas the first recital of each of these directives makes it clear that the directive is based on Court of Justice case law, in particular case law on award criteria, which clarifies the possibilities for the contracting entities to meet the needs of the public, including in the social field. Will the Commission clarify whether, and under what conditions, social clauses may be taken into consideration as award criteria for public procurement contracts?
