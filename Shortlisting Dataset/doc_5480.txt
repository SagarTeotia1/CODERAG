of guilt, embarrassment, frustration and financial loss, B. whereas these complaints reflect a widespread and concerted pattern of misleading business practices on the part of certain business-directory companies affecting thousands of businesses that are organised across frontiers and thus involve activity in two or more Member States within the European Union and beyond, with a significant financial impact on such businesses, and whereas there is no administrative mechanism or legal instrument enabling the national law-enforcement agencies to work together across borders efficiently and effectively, C. whereas the misleading character of these practices becomes more obvious when they are of an electronic nature and are spread using the Internet (see Petition No 0079/2003), D. whereas the business practices complained of typically consist of an approach made, usually by mail, by a business-directory company to businesses inviting them to complete or update their business name and contact details and giving them the false impression that they will be listed in a business directory free of charge; whereas signatories later discover that they have, in fact, unintentionally signed up to a contract, normally binding them for a minimum of three years, to be listed in a business directory at a yearly charge of some EUR 1 000, E. whereas the forms used in such practices are usually ambiguous and difficult to understand, inducing the erroneous idea of a free listing in a business directory but in fact entrapping businesses into unwanted contracts for advertising in business directories, F. whereas neither specific EU legislation nor national legislation exists in Member States concerning directory companies in business-to-business relationships, and whereas Member States have a discretion to introduce more comprehensive and far-reaching legislation, G. whereas Directive 2006/114/EC also applies to business-to-business transactions and defines “misleading advertising” as “any advertising which in any way, including its presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the persons to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches and which, by reason of its deceptive nature, is likely to affect their economic behaviour or which, for those reasons, injures or is likely to injure a competitor”; whereas, however, different interpretations of what is “misleading” seem to be a major practical impediment in combating such practices of directory companies in business-to-business relationships, H. whereas Directive 2005/29/EC prohibits the practice of “including in marketing material an invoice or similar document seeking payment which gives the consumer the impression that he has already ordered the marketed product when he has not”; whereas, however, that Directive does not apply to business-to-business misleading practices and therefore, in its current form, cannot be relied upon to help the petitioners; whereas, however, that Directive does not preclude a system of national rules on unfair commercial practices that is equally applicable under all circumstances to consumers and enterprises, I. whereas Directive 2005/29/EC does not preclude Member States from extending its application also to businesses through national law, whereas, however, this leads to differing levels of protection for businesses which are victims of misleading practices by business-directory companies in different Member States, J. whereas Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 defines “intra-Community infringement” as
