WRITTEN QUESTION E-6690/09 by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE) to the Commission (12 January 2010) Subject: VAT liability in connection with kilometre charge Further to my Written Question E‑6204/09 in connection with the Netherlands kilometre charge law, I wish to point out the following. A number of years ago the Commission brought action against the Netherlands regarding the toll for the tunnel under the Dordtse Kil. According to the Commission, this is not a normal task of a public authority, but an economic activity. The Commission found the provision of access to infrastructure in return for payment to be comparable with the supply of gas, water and electricity, on which VAT must be levied. In its judgment of 12 September 2000 in Case C‑408/97, the European Court of Justice ruled that, in order for there to be no liability to tax, two conditions must be fulfilled: the activities must be carried out by a body governed by public law and they must be carried out by that body acting as a public authority. The European Court ruled that it was common ground that the provision of access to roads on payment of a toll in the Netherlands is carried out by bodies governed by public law. The Commission's argument was therefore not accepted. Could the Commission assess in this context whether or not the Netherlands Government is required to levy VAT in connection with its plans for a kilometre charge?
