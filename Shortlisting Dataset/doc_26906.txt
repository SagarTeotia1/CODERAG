* * 114. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission, the EEAS, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the ENP countries and the Secretary-General of the Union for the Mediterranean . 8.11.2011 OPINION of the Committee on Development for the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy ( 2011/2157(INI) ) Rapporteur: Michèle Striffler SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Development calls on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Stresses that while EU policy in the field of development cooperation falls within the framework of the principles and objectives of its external action – and therefore, in this case, of the European Neighbourhood Policy – the EU nevertheless has a constitutional obligation, enshrined in the second subparagraph of Article 208(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the EEAS never to lose sight of these objectives, which are the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty, in their implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy, both in the eastern neighbourhood partner countries and in those in the southern neighbourhood; 2. Supports the EU’s humanitarian action and action for development and peace in the eastern neighbourhood partner countries, and in particular its important contribution to UNRWA; regrets, however, that this action is not yet accompanied by a strengthening of the EU as a leading political actor in the Middle East; urges the EEAS and the Commission to do their utmost to give the EU’s presence and action in the region a political weight which matches its decisive commitment to humanitarian aid and development aid; 3. Calls for the mandate of the EU Special Representative for the Southern Mediterranean to be utilised in development‑related matters, as it believes that he can play a fundamental role in ensuring that democratic progress goes hand in hand with the consolidation of advances in the development field, and specifically in improving social and economic conditions in the countries in question; 4. Highlights the need for continuing funding for the European Neighbourhood Policy despite the current economic crisis, but points out that under no circumstances can the EU’s development aid and humanitarian aid budgets be reallocated to finance the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is financed through a specific instrument; 5. Highlights the importance, in cases where the EU has mobilised humanitarian aid, of ensuring a suitable transition between rehabilitation, reconstruction and development in order to remedy some of the destructive consequences of the revolutions; 6. Notes that, taking advantage of the winds of freedom blowing across the southern shore of the Mediterranean during the Arab Spring, local civil societies sought to free themselves from the excessive control exercised by those in power; advocates tighter sub-regional cooperation
