WRITTEN QUESTION E-4703/09 by Debora Serracchiani (S-D) to the Commission (6 October 2009) Subject: Nortel-Italia On 14 January Nortel, a company which supplies technology and equipment for fixed and mobile telecommunications and Internet networks and was facing financial difficulties as a result of the economic crisis, launched creditor protection proceedings in Canada, the US and Europe, with a view to achieving rapid restructuring of the company. In the last few days, Ernst & Young, in its capacity as Nortel's joint administrator, and citing international administration proceedings, initiated collective redundancy procedures for employees throughout Europe, including 38 Italian employees, who would be eligible for the ‘availability’ (redeployment) allowance but would not receive any end-of-service allowances or payments. Does the Commission intend to take immediate steps to prevent multinationals from imposing collective redundancy on a centralised basis? Does the Commission intend to introduce adequate measures to protect jobs? Does the Commission intend to adopt a specific strategy to tackle the serious repercussions the crisis is having on employment?
