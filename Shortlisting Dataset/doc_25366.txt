Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (7 June 2010) The refusal by Iran to comply with its international commitments with the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency and Tehran’s unwillingness to pursue the negotiations on nuclear issues with the E3+3 group (United Kingdom, Germany, France, China, USA and the Russian Federation) is a major source of concern for the European Union. Talks are currently ongoing in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on the possible adoption of a fourth round of sanctions against Iran. The European Council Declaration on Iran issued in December 2009 states clearly that ‘the European Union stands ready to take the necessary steps to accompany this UNSC process’, in the context of the dual-track approach.
