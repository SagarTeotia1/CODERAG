Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (27 May 2010) Article 2 of Directive 2009/40/EC on roadworthiness tests for motorvehicles and their trailers OJ L 141, 6.6.2009, recast of Directive 96/96/EC, OJ L 46, 17.2.1997. states that these tests shall be carried out either by public bodies or by bodies or establishments designated and directly supervised by the State, including duly authorised private bodies. As regards the current situation within Member States, roadworthiness test centres are accordingly operating under various public or private legal regimes. Adequate safeguards have been introduced in Directive 2009/40/EC with a view to ensuring that when such tasks are entrusted to a private company, the general public interest of road safety is not jeopardised. In particular, Member States are requied to put in place an authorisation procedure and keep those establishments under direct supervision. Finally, in view of avoiding a conflict of interests between the testing and the repair of vehicles, Member States must, in particular, ensure the objectivity and high quality of the vehicle testing. It should also be noted that the European Court of Justice has recently ruled C-438/08 Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic. that the principle of freedom of establishment as provided by Article 49 TFEU has to be respected in cases of bodies of other Member States intending to carry on in Portugal the activity of vehicle inspection.
