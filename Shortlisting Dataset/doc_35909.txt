9999/C Q999 E/015 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1220/04 by Robert Evans (PSE) to the Commission (14 April 2004) Subject: Czech Republic's Endowment Fund for Holocaust Victims Is the Commission aware of the criteria for receiving compensation from the Czech Republic's Endowment Fund for the Holocaust Victims to Individuals to Alleviate Some Property Injustice Suffered by the Holocaust Victims, namely Article III, Section 1-4? One of my constituents had his claim rejected as he is a nephew of a Holocaust victim (and therefore not of direct lineage). Is it the case that inheritance laws in all EU countries would enable him, as a nephew and the sole surviving relative, to inherit the (stolen) assets? If this is the case, would the Commission agree that it is therefore unfair that he should have his claim rejected on these grounds? It is unfortunate that a fund established to alleviate injustice has also served to create further feelings of injustice across the EU. Is the Commission willing to raise this issue with the Czech authorities?
