access to energy and the development of infrastructures, particularly information and communication technologies; 47. Considers that a distinction needs to be drawn between commercial services and public services; stresses the need for public services to remain outside GATS, particularly those which help to provide access to vital public goods such as health, education, drinking water and energy, and those which play a prominent part in cultural identity, such as audiovisual services; 48. Stresses the importance, also for developing countries, of enhancing market access for service providers, whilst safeguarding the ability of all WTO members to regulate their own service sectors in accordance with GATS, including the possibility of exempting basic sectors such as health, education and audio-visual services; regrets that no specific framework on services has been established within the WTO negotiations so far, especially in sectors which are of interest for the export possibilities of developing countries; calls for substantial progress in this field; 49. Calls on the Commission to guarantee full flexibility in the area of services and to allow to every country the freedom to include or exclude any services in or from the list of services to be liberalised; 50. Calls on the Commission to implement a services-related trade policy that supports the movement of natural persons in developing countries and contributes to the availability of those types of services that can boost development and contribute to poverty reduction; 51. Stresses the need to allow the poorest developing countries some latitude as to how far they reciprocate in opening up markets, so as to protect the most vulnerable countries by allowing them to decide for themselves how quickly liberalisation should proceed; 52. Stresses the need for available and affordable medicines for developing countries, while at the same time taking into account the concerns of producers; 53. Emphasises that poverty is largely a female phenomenon ("the feminisation of poverty") and stresses the need to review the gender impact of trade policies in order to design policies which stop and reverse marginalising effects such as land ownership concentration in male hands, male migration to urban areas and an increase in rural poverty, destruction of local markets, concentration of badly paid low-skill female jobs in export processing zones, etc., by introducing incentives and positive discrimination measures addressed to governments and companies with European ownership; 54. Calls for a systematic analysis of the gender dimension of trade expansion that examines the various trends and takes into account the complexity of the issues and factors involved, such as women’s access to economic and technical resources, their participation in the labour market, rates and patterns of discrimination and the gender divide in the labour market, women’s access to education and their level of education and their access to health care and socio-cultural resources; 55. Notes that women benefit less from the opportunities presented by liberalisation of trade and globalisation, while at the same time they are harder hit by the adverse effects of those phenomena, and urges the EU therefore, in its trade-related assistance programmes, to devote specific attention to increasing opportunities for women
