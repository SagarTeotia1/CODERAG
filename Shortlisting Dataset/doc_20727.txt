WRITTEN QUESTION E-1749/07 by Esko Seppänen (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (2 April 2007) Subject: The price of electricity The Commission has set itself the objective of opening up and unifying the EU’s market in electricity. Is it aiming for one and the same electricity price in all the Member States, and if so, does it consider that — thanks to the effect of market mechanisms — the price of electricity will rise in those countries where it is currently cheaper than elsewhere towards the price in countries where it is more expensive?
