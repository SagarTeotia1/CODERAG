Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2008) Coal imports from Russia in 2007 accounted for approximately 35 % of total United Kingdom (UK) coal use. Growing coal imports from Russia result from commercial decisions of UK coal-users motivated by a number of factors. These include price/quality considerations: low sulphur and nitrogen content of the Russian coal makes it a more convenient/cost-efficient solution for tightening emissions standards than investment in retrofits and technology upgrades of existing installations. Further increases in coal use in the UK are likely to result mainly from construction of new power plants. Coal suitable for such installations can be procured from a vast array of international suppliers active on the global, highly liquid and competitive coal market. It is thus not inevitable that construction of new power plants, with or without carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and storage (CCS), leads to increases in imports of Russian coal and/or to UK's dependence on Russian coal.
