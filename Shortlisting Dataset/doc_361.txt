Supplementary answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (10 September 2008) Following the last the Commission's earlier reply on this case, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member about progress on this dossier regarding the authorisation for the construction of a landfill for non-hazardous waste in Comune di Senna Lodigiana. The Italian authorities have informed the Commission as follows: On 21 April 2008, the Italian competent authorities decided not to issue the Integrated Environmental Authorisation necessary for the construction of the landfill. On 2 May 2008 the stakeholder in this case has submitted counterclaims to the above decision following Article 10 of the relevant national legislation (L. 241/1990). Subsequent to the evaluation of such counterclaims, the competent authorities will either confirm the refusal of a permit to construct the landfill or they will reopen the procedures.
