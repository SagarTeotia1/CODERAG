Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (15 June 2011) The Commission calculated all the costs relating to its proposal for a directive on the use of passenger name record data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime COM(2011)32 final, 2.2.2011. . The calculations appear in detail in the impact assessment that accompanies the Commission's proposal SEC(2011)132 final, 2.2.2011. . Council document 9103/11 of 15 April 2011, which the Honourable Member refers to, basically reflects the analysis of the Commission's impact assessment. The Commission concluded that even with the highest calculations, if the carriers decide to pass on their costs to passengers, this would result in an additional cost of less than EUR 0.10 per ticket. This figure was calculated by adding all the costs of carriers together, equal to EUR 50 360 000 and dividing it by the total number of passengers on international flights, i.e. 500 000 000. The proposal of the Commission will also have a financial impact on Member States. Detailed information on that impact is contained in the same impact assessment.
