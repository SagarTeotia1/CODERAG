Answer given by Baroness Ashton on behalf of the Commission (30 April 2009) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑0993/09 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp by Mr Romagnoli. With respect to the call of President Sarkozy for measures to be taken in Europe to protect the European industry in imitation of the United States stimulus package, the Commission would like to re-assure the Honourable Member that it wants to keep markets open and avoid all form of protectionist measures, i.e. no new barriers to investment or to trade and no new export restrictions. The Commission is committed to achieving an ambitious, balanced and comprehensive outcome to the World Trade Organisation Doha Development Agenda negotiations. The European Council has fully supported the coordinated approach and principles set forth in the Commission communication of 4 March 2009 on ‘Driving European recovery’ Communication for the spring European Council — ‘Driving European recovery’, COM(2009)114 final. . In particular, measures taken by Member States to support the real economy and employment should be implemented in a timely, targeted and temporary manner, while respecting the following guiding principles: promoting openness within the internal market and vis-à-vis third countries; ensuring non-discrimination of products and services from other Member States; ensuring consistency with long-term reform objectives. In particular, the Commission's communication of 25 February 2009 Communication from the Commission — ‘Responding to the crisis in the European automotive industry’, COM(2009)104 final. establishes an important framework for action in support of the automotive sector, including enhanced European coordination of schemes for the renewal of car fleets.
