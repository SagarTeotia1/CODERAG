WRITTEN QUESTION E-2532/04 by Paul van Buitenen (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (19 October 2004) Subject: Subsequent employment of an outgoing Director-General 1. Can the Commission inform the European Parliament, with a simple yes or no, whether it intends to authorise the recruitment of Mr Mingasson by UNICE (the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe) as soon as he retires from the post of Director‑General of DG Enterprise? 2. Given the highly sensitive nature of the information dealt with by Mr Mingasson in his role as Director‑General of DG Enterprise, with particular regard to European industry, would it not be appropriate for the Commission to apply the rules of the current Staff Regulations (see Article 16) and not to authorise a recruitment of this kind? 3. Can the Commission provide details, in a spirit of complete transparency, of the criteria on the basis of which it has deemed or will deem there to be no conflicts of interest, particularly in terms of compliance with the rules on integrity and discretion relating to the recruitment of former senior officials of the European Commission?
