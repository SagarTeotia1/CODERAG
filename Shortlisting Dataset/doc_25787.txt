2004/C 84 E/177 WRITTEN QUESTION E-4037/03 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (12 January 2004) Subject: Health reform and natural remedies in Germany As part of its health reforms, Germany has changed the law and made competition between conventional pharmaceutical medicines and natural remedies virtually impossible. Although experts have been working on a positive list of medicinal products including herbal, homeopathic and anthroposophic remedies for years, the German Government's so-called health reform has now removed the possibility of reimbursement for natural medicines through health insurance schemes. Thanks to the health reform, a distortion in competition has emerged that benefits pharmaceutical products. Many patients use natural treatments and remedies, which produce better results in many cases than conventional treatment. These successes should not be brought to an end by market competition between pharmaceutical and natural products favouring the former. As well as the prospect of worse treatment for patients opting for natural medicine, small manufacturers of natural remedies in particular are threatened with bankruptcy. How does the Commission view this situation from the point of view of competition law?
