Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (23 October 2008) Upon accession on 1 January 2007, Romania entered a commitment with the European Union to continue the reform of its judiciary and strengthen the fight against corruption. Progress with judiciary reform and the fight against corruption is since then monitored against several benchmarks by both the Romanian Government in its progress reports and in its action plan, as well as by the Commission. Ensuring the ‘legal and institutional stability of the anti-corruption framework, in particular by maintaining the current nomination and revocation procedure for the General Prosecutor and the Chief Prosecutor of the National Anti-corruption Directorate’ is part of this commitment and part of these benchmarks.
