ask the Honourable Member to contact the Apulia Region Assessorato all'Agricoltura for information about funding for reforestation in the specific area of Alta Murgia in the framework of the above programmes. 2. Under the current LIFE III Programme, projects are the responsibility of individual beneficiaries and not of a region. It is not possible to freeze funding to all beneficiaries in a region indiscriminately. Funding can only be revoked where a beneficiary is in infringement of Community rules. The Apulia Region is not a current LIFE beneficiary: however, infringement of Community rules in the Region could be taken into account if the Region itself were to propose a LIFE project in the 2004 round. This is the last round of the LIFE III Programme, which expires on 31 December 2004. 3. The Commission has registered a complaint on the issues raised by the Honourable Member for poor application of Directives 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds and 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992 . on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. This complaint is under assessment. The information given by the Honourable Member has been added to the above- mentioned complaint file. Should the Commission come to the conclusion that Community law is being breached in the specific case, it will not hesitate, as the Guardian of the Treaty, to take all necessary measures, including opening infringement procedures under Article 226 of the EC Treaty, in order to ensure compliance with the relevant Community law.
