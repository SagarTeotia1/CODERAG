Question for written answer E-8947/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Corina Creţu (S&D) (28 October 2010) Subject: What action will the Commission take in respect of the impunity of certain African leaders, especially Omar al-Bashir? UN Security Council Resolution 1593 calls on all countries of the world to cooperate with the International Criminal Court in the case of the mass crimes in Darfur. However, the President of Sudan travels with impunity in many African and Arab countries, which are not fulfilling their obligations to enforce the international arrest warrant issued against Omar al-Bashir a year and a half ago for crimes against humanity. Furthermore, in July this year the Sudanese president was formally charged by the court in The Hague with ethnic cleansing, resulting in over 300 000 deaths and 2.5 million refugees. The humanitarian tragedy in Darfur has been the subject of European concerns over recent years. Since we have not managed to do more to help the victims, it is now time for us to insist on punishing the culprits. The main problem we are facing in this kind of critical and bloody situation is that of the impunity of leaders who, knowing they are invulnerable, trample over people's lives and their fundamental rights. What action does the Commission intend to take in order to send a strong signal to Africa and the entire world that all states must fulfil their obligations towards the International Criminal Court, so that those being pursued for crimes against humanity can be prosecuted?
