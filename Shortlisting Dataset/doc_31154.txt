This led to a more general debate about the nature of EU conflict prevention strategies. "Should we become a moral agent or should we treat conflict prevention as a part of our Common Foreign and Security Policy," asked Ryszard Legutko (Polish Senate). "Should we stay regional or go global," asked Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck (ALDE, BE). There were also differing views on the issue of establishing any kind of European army. While some called for a central Brussels command for the EU's Rapid Reaction Forces, others could not consider dispatching their country's troops anywhere without prior authorisation from national authorities. EU as a beacon? One idea, however, did gain wide acceptance. "All conflicts in the world come from previous unresolved conflicts," said Miomir Zuzul (Croatia), "so the key word is reconciliation." Participants broadly agreed, also noting that in this regard, the EU was very well-placed to serve as a model. "The EU itself is an example of successful politics of conflict prevention," said Ms Beer. 2006-12-04 Co-chair Angelika Beer Greens/EFA DE Co-Chair Jari Vilén Finnish Parliament FI Joint parliamentary meeting on the future of Europe, 4 and 5 December 2006 - Working group on conflict prevention 20061204IPR00922 Joint parliamentary meeting website "The EU's role in conflict prevention" working group - details EN 1 LINK http://www.futureofeurope.europarl.europa.eu/future/cms/lang/en/ EN 2 LINK http://www.futureofeurope.europarl.europa.eu/future/cms/cache/offonce/lang/en/pid/89;jsessionid=0CDF239E410D94C4783390E2B92FE975 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
