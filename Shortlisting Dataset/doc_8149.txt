WRITTEN QUESTION E-4866/05 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (3 January 2006) Subject: Equatorial Guinea Various reports by human rights organisations have repeatedly denounced the situation of extreme poverty affecting the majority of the population in Equatorial Guinea, in stark contrast to the spectacular rise in oil production, estimated at around 700000 barrels per day. It is also claimed in a recent report by the US Senate that a large part of the profits from this oil production are being diverted by the country's president, Teodoro Obiang, to secret accounts at Riggs Bank. Sources linked to the opposition in Equatorial Guinea report that, in view of his failing health, Teodoro Obiang may be preparing to hand over power to his son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang. According to these sources, the current regime has been meeting members of the Angolan Government to arrange the sending of Angolan troops, which would guarantee the succession in the event of opposition to a possible handover of power. The same sources claim that countries such as South Africa, Ghana and Israel are providing support for this idea. What action is the Commission taking in response to the constant deterioration in basic living conditions for the population? Has it set up any kind of aid scheme to alleviate the situation? Will it establish a dialogue with the government with a view to improved protection for human rights in the country? Will it support a new special procedure in the United Nations Human Rights Commission? Is the Commission making its trade relations with this country in any way conditional on improvements in the human rights situation? Would the Commission support the handover of presidential powers to Teodoro Obiang's son? Will it exert pressure on the international community with a view to a democratisation process being launched in Equatorial Guinea in response to the imminent handover of the presidency?
