Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2008) In 2006, the Court of Justice ruled, contrary to the Commission's contentions, that the use of nuclear energy for military purposes falls outside the scope of all the provisions of the Euratom Treaty as well as its secondary legislation Case 65/04 of 9 March 2006 Commission v UK; C‑61/03 of 12 April 2005 Commission v UK. . The Commission is, therefore, not in a position to respond to the questions put by the Honourable Member.
