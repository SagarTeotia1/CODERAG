Question for written answer E-002161/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (23 February 2012) Subject: The place of women farmers in the new common agricultural policy Like most Member States, Belgium has, over the last 30 years or so, seen a huge decline in the number of farms. With about 1 000 farms currently going out of business every year, women farmers (mainly assisting spouses) are being forced to leave farming in order to seek work elsewhere, and the scale of the phenomenon is worrying: the figure is thought to be close to 6 %. Since, in many cases, they have few qualifications, if they want to provide for their families these women farmers have to resign themselves to accepting poorly paid low-status jobs, with little job security. Yet everyone agrees that the economic potential of women, of all generations, is essential on farms. Men and women in rural areas are entitled to have a future in terms of living standards and prosperity. The principle of gender equality needs to be applied to the common agricultural policy, as it is a way of promoting sustainable economic growth and rural development. It is therefore vital for the European Union to refocus its support strategies in order to develop rural areas with a view to making women’s lives easier. In particular, this means promoting the entrepreneurial mind-set and the skills of women in agriculture, improving access and specific training for women, equipping rural areas with modern infrastructure, aiming for greater recognition of, and more support for, women’s networks, promoting the quality and accessibility of infrastructure and service facilities, introducing proper social security for women working in agriculture, bringing about shared farm ownership, and, in general, paying more attention to women. What measures will the Commission propose as a matter of priority to keep women on farms and thereby maintain the number of farmers in the European Union on a lasting basis?
