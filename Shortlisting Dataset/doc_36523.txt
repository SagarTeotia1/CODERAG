Question for written answer E-002991/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Zuzana Roithová (PPE) (25 March 2011) Subject: Financing of the 2014-20 MEDIA Programme The MEDIA Programme has proved very successful hitherto. Films financed under this programme have been big hits with both the public and the critics and have won a number of awards, for example ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ and ‘The King’s Speech’, which both won Oscars. Apart from the considerable financial support which it provides for audiovisual projects, the MEDIA Programme is also crucial to the continued existence of certain film festivals and educational programmes, which could not take place without it. Any cuts in its budget or merger with other programmes could have significant repercussions on the competitiveness of the European film industry. It should also be emphasised that the culture sector contributes to the GDP of the European Union to the tune of 2.6 %, although it only draws upon 0.05 % of the EU budget. Cuts in the MEDIA Programme would entail reduced funding for the culture sector and would be inconsistent with the Europe 2020 strategy. 1. Is the Commission aware of the fundamental importance of the MEDIA Programme for the maintenance, development and competitiveness of the European film industry? 2. How does the Commission intend to guarantee sufficient funding for the MEDIA Programme for the period 2014‑20? 3. What concrete form does the Commission propose the MEDIA Programme should take in the period 2014‑20 and what budget is it planning for this programme compared with previous periods?
