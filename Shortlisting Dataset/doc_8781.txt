reform is on the right track; 33. Welcomes the announcement in the White Paper (Action 96) of the reorganisation of the procedure for the recovery of unduly paid funds; 34. Rejects the proposal also made in the White Paper (Action 66) concerning the setting-up of an advisory financial irregularities panel of a help-desk nature to which, according to the Commission's ideas, cases of financial error or suspected irregularity not involving fraud would be submitted; fears that this proposal will circumvent and undermine the responsibilities of OLAF; draws the Commission's attention to the fact that this would be contrary to the legal provisions laying down the tasks and powers of OLAF; 35. Expects the Council, in cooperation with Parliament, acting within their own spheres of competence, to ensure that the procedures for recasting the Financial Regulation and the revision of the Staff Regulations are completed as soon as possible; 36. Urges the Commission to extend and apply Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1. to all Community programmes and actions; 37. Hopes, in that spirit, that the power to clear EAGGF accounts conferred on the Commission will be extended to all Community appropriations not managed by its services, in order that Parliament be provided with additional and more extensive financial control data in its capacity as budgetary authority; 38. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and the governments of the Member States.
