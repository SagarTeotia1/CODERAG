Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (19 July 2007) 1. The Commission reported on Albania's progress in human rights fields, including the protection of children, in its last annual Progress Report in November 2006 COM(2006)649 final. . The Commission uses its regular monitoring meetings with the Albanian authorities to underline the importance of putting in place mechanisms for child protection. The Commission expects Albania to fulfil its European Partnership priorities. The European Partnership calls on Albania to take measures to improve its social protection systems. More broadly, the European Partnership underlines the importance of combating the social exclusion which leads to phenomena such as child labour. 2. The Commission provides financial support to help Albania improve its labour inspection services. This support will help optimise the inspection and enforcement capacities of labour inspectors and should therefore help to prevent abuses such as the use of child labour.
