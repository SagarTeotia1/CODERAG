of the EU budget for 2007 is the need to take account of the enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria and the re-allocation of a number of key budget lines; stresses the need to ensure that they will have full access to programmes covering gender equality and women's rights issues; 8. Points out that, while pre-accession assistance for Turkey (Item 22 02 04 01) keeps increasing, it is crucial to support Turkey’s efforts further to improve protection of human rights, and especially that of women’s rights, and suggests earmarking a certain percentage of funds for actions and programmes based on sufficient levels of financing and aimed at improving gender equality and protection of women’s rights, especially those undertaken in common with women’s organisations in the Member States; 9. Reiterates that, as pointed out both in the conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 29 June 2003 and in its own resolution of 1 June 2006 on the situation of women in armed conflicts and their role in the reconstruction and democratic process in post-conflict countries Texts Adopted of that date, P6_TA(2006)0245 . , women have an active role to play in establishing and maintaining peace and in securing democracy; considers that EU aid to countries and regions devastated by armed conflict and war, such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon, should be specifically linked to promoting this role and to the reinsertion and participation of women in social, economic and political life; is of the opinion that total transparency of funding of reconstruction in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon must therefore be ensured by establishing specific budget lines to this effect.
