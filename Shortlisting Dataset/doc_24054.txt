Question for written answer E-4631/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (22 June 2010) Subject: Facebook, Google and EU privacy laws As the Commission will be aware, there have been concerns expressed in recent weeks over Facebook's policy of making many of its users' personal information more widely available than those users had expected or signed up to. The argument of the company appeared to be that it was possible for users to alter privacy settings from within the Facebook site to block the process. Many users were quite simply unaware of what was going on, and the company has now simplified the procedure for improving privacy. Was Facebook's policy, in the Commission's view, compatible with EU data protection law or with the ECJ's developed jurisprudence with regard to privacy, and, if not, what measures are available to the Commission to enforce compliance with EC law? Does current EC law operate on the principle that permission given by an individual to a commercial organisation to disseminate personal information under certain, specified, conditions cannot be used by that commercial organisation as a basis for disseminating that information more widely without the individual's specific consent or is the default position to allow dissemination of information unless you opt out? If not, will the Commission seek to introduce such a principle into EU data protection law at the earliest opportunity? Concerns have also been expressed by many constituents over Google's Street Map tool, and specifically, the tool's compatibility with Convention rights to privacy and family life. Certain procedures exist for individuals to take their homes off the site, although these are not widely known about, and appear to discriminate against those who either do not have, or do not know how to use, a computer. Even if the Commission considers that a requirement for ‘explicit consent’ would not be warranted in this case, does the Commission not take the view that Google should be required to set up procedures offline, such as by phone or by writing a letter, as well as online, which would allow those who do not wish their homes to be a part of the Street Index to have them taken off, and has the Commission had any discussions with Google along these lines?
