WRITTEN QUESTION E-0290/07 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Council (1 February 2007) Subject: Threats made against a bishop by a self-styled mayor in the occupied territories of Cyprus Mr Ozay Oykun (the self-styled mayor of occupied Yialousa in Cyprus) has directly threatened the life of the bishop of Karpasia whom the Archbishop of Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos, wishes to appoint in occupied Karpasia. According to the Turkish Cypriot newspaper Kibrisli of 15 January 2007, Mr Oykun stated: ‘Who can guarantee the safety of the bishop who is about to be installed …’. The Archbishop of Cyprus has announced — as is his right, being the religious leader of the entire island — that he intends to appoint a bishop to the occupied peninsula of Karpasia, a move which triggered the above provocative and threatening statement by the self-styled mayor of Yialousa, whose rightful inhabitants have been refugees for 33 consecutive years. How does the Council intend to respond to this fascist threat to kill the bishop who is due to be installed in Karpasia in occupied Cyprus?
