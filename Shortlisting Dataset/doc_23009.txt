Question for written answer E-011299/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Gianluca Susta (S&D) (13 January 2011) Subject: Equal rights for legitimate and illegitimate children Having regard to the combined provisions of Articles 8, 12 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and bearing in mind that the European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly upheld the principle of equality between legitimate and illegitimate children, including with regard to inheritance (cf. the judgment of 1 February 2000 in the case of Mazurek v France ), 1. does the Commission acknowledge that the right to be recognised as a son or daughter is a fundamental human right and that all children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, must enjoy equal rights and be fully informed about their origins and identity, in order to protect their health and prevent hereditary diseases and disorders? 2. does the Commission agree that there is a need for European harmonisation of the various laws governing this matter in the individual States?
