EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Background Groundwater is an important natural resource, forming a reservoir from which high-quality water is obtained for use as drinking water and in industry and agriculture. The Groundwater Directive (80/68/EEC) and the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) both contain provisions on the protection of groundwater against pollution. However, the 1980 Groundwater Directive is to be repealed in 2013, since, with two exceptions, the Water Framework Directive also covers the key requirements for the protection of groundwater. On 19 September 2003 the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution, as called for in Article 17 of the Water Framework Directive. The proposal for a directive lays down criteria and procedures to be used in assessing the chemical status of groundwater, identifying significant and sustained upward trends and defining starting points for trend reversals and provides for measures to prevent or restrict inputs of pollutants into groundwater. Following Parliament’s first reading of 28 April 2005, the Council adopted its Common Position on 23 January 2006. Parliament did not regard that text as a suitable means of establishing a clear, effective and adequate set of rules on the protection of groundwater in Europe. At second reading, on 13 June 2006, it therefore adopted a total of 41 amendments to the Council’s Common Position. The Council informed Parliament unofficially at an early juncture and officially by means of a letter of 10 October 2006 that it could not accept all Parliament’s amendments and that a conciliation procedure would be necessary. That procedure was then formally opened on 17 October 2006. The conciliation procedure Parliament’s delegation held its constituent meeting on 5 July 2006 in Strasbourg. Between 5 September and 10 October 2006 three trialogues took place (5 September 2006, 19 September 2006 and 10 October 2006) at which the EP delegation was represented by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, EP Vice-President and Chairwoman of the delegation, Mr Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and Mrs Klaß, rapporteur. Parliament’s delegation held meetings after each of the trialogues (6 September 2006, 27 September 2006 and 10 October 2006). These meetings led to provisional agreement on 24 amendments, subject to overall agreement being reached on the text. The Conciliation Committee met on the evening of 17 October 2006 to formally open the procedure and with a view to resolving outstanding issues. After several hours of discussions, overall agreement was reached shortly before midnight. The outcome of the negotiations was confirmed by Parliament’s delegation by 16 votes in favour, with 4 abstentions. Outcome of the conciliation procedure The main points of the agreement reached following the conciliation procedure can be summarised as follows: Protection of groundwater against deterioration One of Parliament’s priorities was to make the protection of groundwater against deterioration one of the objectives of the directive. Its delegation managed to secure the incorporation of the phrase ‘protection against deterioration’ in the title
