Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (19 November 2004) The training activities to which the Honourable Member refers are in general terms eligible for European Social Fund (ESF) co-funding in Italian regions. As for the practical implementation, it is necessary to underline that all decisions concerning calls for proposals and the choice of the beneficiaries are the exclusive responsibility of the national and regional managing authorities. Regarding this specific company, it is important to note that the Commission has no means of certifying the quality of the company mentioned by the Honourable Member. Training activities of the same nature are being carried out in Italy and in the other Member States.
