January 2005, a member can draw a monthly pension of EUR 1 276 from age 60 onwards and after only five years of contributions; 85. Notes that the Bureau has not acted on the Court of Auditors’ observations between 2002 and 2005; notes that, on 30 November 2005, the Bureau approved the following measures: - an increase in monthly contributions as from 2006: EUR 1 094 for members and EUR 2 088 for Parliament; - a report to be drawn up by a working party on the financial situation of the pension fund; 86. Takes the view that the relationship between Parliament and the pension fund should be placed on a contractual footing by the end of this year; calls on the Secretary-General to forward to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in December 2006, a report on the progress achieved; 87. Believes, furthermore, that Members' contributions to the voluntary pension scheme should be paid directly from personal income rather than through the parliamentary allowance system; Notes, however, that in respect of the current contribution system "in its Opinion No 5/99, the Court of Auditors arrived at the following conclusion "From the Fund's and from the members point of view, the system has worked effectively. Additionally it has enabled Parliament to calculate its own payment obligations correctly since, according to the rules, Parliament has to pay the double of the amount effectively paid by the members"; notes that the Court saw no problems in maintaining the system provided that it was better defined and its operation set down in a formal document; 88. Notes with concern that the deduction of contributions to the pension scheme from the general expenditure allowance leaves Members exposed to allegations that public funds may be put towards the cost of private pension contributions, and therefore calls on the Parliament's Bureau to propose before 31 March 2007 measures to ensure that such payments are made directly by pension scheme members through direct debit orders; 89. Notes that, after the Statute for Members of the European Parliament enters into force in 2009, Members will be treated equally and the additional pension fund will no longer be allowed to admit new members; takes the view furthermore that once the Statute for Members has entered into force: – the voluntary pension scheme should simply settle claims; – members should no longer be able to join the voluntary pension fund; previously acquired entitlements would be maintained, however; European political parties 90.
