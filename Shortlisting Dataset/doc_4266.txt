Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (7 August 2006) The prevention of and the fight against child prostitution is a particular concern and political priority of the Commission. In its communication COM(2005)514 final. Fighting trafficking in human beings — an integrated approach and proposals for an action plan of 18 October 2005. , the Commission paid particular attention to offences related to child trafficking, in particular coercing children into prostitution or engaging in sexual activities with child prostitutes. Against this background the Commission pays particular attention to reports about child prostitution in the German-Czech-Austrian border region. In more detail, the Commission would like to point out the following. 1. With regard to tackling corruption in relation to child prostitution in border areas, two instruments may be relevant. Firstly, the Convention on the Fight against Corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union 1997 Council Act of 26 May 1997 drawing up, on the basis of Article K.3 (2) (c) of the Treaty on European Union, the Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of Member States of the European Union, OJ C 195, 25.6.1997. requires Member States to ensure that both passive and active corruption involving an official ‘Official’ shall mean any Community or national official, including any national official of another Member State; ‘national official’ shall be understood by reference to the definition of ‘official’ or ‘public officer’ in the national law of the Member State in which the person in question performs that function for the purposes of application of the criminal law of that Member State. are made a criminal offence. Secondly, the Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 on combating corruption in the private sector (OJ L 192 of 31.7.2003), which repealed the earlier Joint Action 98/742/JHA, OJ L 192 of 31.7.2003. requires Member States to ensure that both active and passive corruption in the private sector, constitutes a criminal offence when it is intentional, and carried out in the course of business activities. It is of course open to Member States to have additional legal measures in place which address aspects of corruption. 2. Regional cross-border cooperation between national law enforcement authorities is largely in the hands of the Member States. There are, however, instruments adopted at EU level that should be used in order to impove such cooperation, for example Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams OJ L 162, 20.6.2002. See also Report from the Commission on national measures taken to comply with the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on Joint Investigation Teams, Brussels, 7 January 2005, COM(2004)858 final and SEC(2004)1725. . According to the act the competent authorities of two or more Member States may, by mutual agreement, set up a joint investigation team for a specific purpose and a limited period, which may be extended by mutual consent, to carry out
