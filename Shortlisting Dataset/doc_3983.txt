WRITTEN QUESTION E-0934/06 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Council (7 March 2006) Subject: Andorra — trade-union law and unemployment benefit Thirteen years ago, Andorra approved a Constitution which specifically includes the right to trade-union freedom. However, that Constitution has not yet been enacted, which means that the country still has no trade-union law — something which is essential to the democratic functioning of a society. With reference to the agreement between Andorra and the EU and in view of the large number of EU citizens working in the country, is the Council intending to take any action which would establish trade-union freedoms in the Principality?
