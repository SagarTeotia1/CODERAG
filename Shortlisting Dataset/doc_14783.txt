Question for written answer E-002087/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (4 March 2011) Subject: Exposure of Portuguese banks According to data appearing in January 2011, the resources received by Portuguese banks in ECB credits amount to EUR 41 billion, or the equivalent of 8 % of the sector's assets or 24 % of national GDP. Comparatively, in December 2009 Portuguese banks held no more than EUR 11.8 billion in ECB credits. In other words, the last year has seen a 248 % increase, a phenomenon not unrelated to the closure of the interbank market to Portuguese banks. The equivalent exposure in Spain amounts to EUR 56 billion (for a far larger banking sector), a figure which points up the financing problems facing Portugal's banks. 1. How is the Commission monitoring the dependent situation of the Portuguese banking sector in relation to ECB loans? Does it believe that Portugal's banks will again pass with distinction the stress tests which will take place in the first half of this year? 2. For how long does the Commission believe the ECB can go on funding banks which appear unable to finance themselves on the interbank market? How does it foresee the transition from a phase of ‘aid’ to banks in the peripheral economies (including Portugal) to a post-crisis phase in which that aid would be substantially reduced or eliminated? 3. What is the risk, according to the Commission, of the Portuguese banking sector entering circumstances similar to those which have occurred in Ireland?
