the Commission has not committed itself to any particular solution. The Commission has now launched a further study to assess in quantitative terms the economic benefits lost throughout the EU as a result of incomplete implementation and enforcement of the waste acquis. These benefits shall be set in relation with the estimated costs for better implementation, notably with reference to the previous study the Honourable Member has referred to. Results are expected until October 2011. The Commission will then consider making proposals for further steps.
