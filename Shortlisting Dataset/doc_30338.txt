Reply (21 September 2006) As the Honourable Member is aware, the European Parliament and the Council are currently examining the proposal for the seventh framework programme (FP7) in the context of co‑decision procedure. At its meeting on 24 July 2006, the Council reached political agreement on FP7 for research and technological development. As the Honourable Member noted, the statutes of INTAS (the International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the New Independent States of the Former Soviet Union) provide that the organisation is established for a period lasting until 31 December 2006 unless its members decide otherwise by unanimity. The Council's understanding is that a decision to extend INTAS is not envisaged. Therefore, acknowledging the useful role INTAS has played, the Council's position, as reflected in the General Approach to FP7, is that FP7 activities regarding EECCA countries Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. currently undertaken by INTAS will be subsumed under the relevant activities within the framework of international cooperation. It would be for the Commission, which is responsible for the management of the Programme, to implement these cooperation activities.
