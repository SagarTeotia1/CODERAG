billing can play in increasing consumer awareness of how and why energy is being used and therefore in changing consumer behaviour; calls on the Council and the Commission to propose measures which help low income households to achieve energy savings in their homes, thereby reducing their energy bills and their exposure to future price increases; 67. Points out that energy policy calls for cost-intensive, long-term investment decisions which must be based on a high degree of transparency and predictability: calls on the Member States and the Commission to provide undertakings with this planning security and not to put forward, at regular, brief intervals, new regulatory proposals which create uncertainty and delay vitally needed investments in energy infrastructure; 68. Reaffirms its strong support for renewable energy sources; in order to boost diversification of energy sources, proposes that the Commission should set a stable, long-term policy framework in order to create the necessary investment climate; this framework should contain an EU target for energy efficiency improvements of at least 20% by 2020; asks the Commission to propose a framework for a range of harmonised support schemes for renewable energies as part of the renewable energy roadmap; 69. Stresses that further action is required to deliver a functioning internal market for energy through a clearer separation of energy production from energy distribution; calls, therefore, for stronger independent regulatory control, taking into account the European market, as well as national measures to deliver on the European Union's target of 10% minimum interconnection levels, by identifying key bottlenecks and appointing coordinators; ◙ Improving Lisbon governance for better regulation Better regulation 70. Supports all efforts by all institutions to carry forward the better lawmaking agenda; believes that Parliament should retain the lead role in promoting better lawmaking by securing the basis for common procedures with other institutions, for independent impact assessments of proposed legislation, for greater openness in Council decision-making and for improved democratic scrutiny of the adoption by the Commission of delegated legislation; 71. Notes that impediments to democracy and cost-intensive obligations do not arise solely out of legislation, but primarily also out of comitology decisions; calls, therefore, for comitology decisions also to be the subject of comprehensive, independent impact assessments; 72. Welcomes the European Commission's initiative on reducing administrative and cost burdens for businesses; asks to be more closely involved in obtaining solid cost-benefit analyses as a basis for informed decision-making, and therefore calls on the Commission to develop a methodology for an independent ex ante assessment of administrative costs; urges the Council, the Commission and the Member States to commit to a joint cost reduction target at the next EU Spring Council; calls on the Commission to regularly consider all policy instruments, legislative and non-legislative, with a view to achieving the desired objectives; insists that all simplification initiatives comply fully with the principles and conditions outlined in its resolution of 16 May 2006 on the strategy for simplification of the regulatory environment; 73. Suggests that a 25% reduction in the administrative burden on the Member States would lead to an increase in real GDP of
