Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (7 September 2006) The Commission has not considered specific measures to encourage tourist facilities to display information in more than one language. It is however commonly accepted that in the case of European and international tourism the information for tourists is provided in more than one language. Concerning the Honourable Member’s question on the European Capitals of Culture, the decision currently in force as a basis for this action Decision 1419/1999/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2005 to 2019, OJ L 166, 1.7.1999. (1419/1999/EC) specifies in Article 3 that the submission should specify how the nominated city intends ‘… to encourage the reception of citizens of the Union and the widest possible dissemination of the various events by employing all forms of multimedia’. In practical terms, the panel which assesses the proposals for a given year examines the communication- and tourism strategy envisaged by the candidate city to attract tourists from all over Europe; the above also considering issues related to a multilingual approach.
