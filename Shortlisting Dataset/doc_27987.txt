Reply (5 May 2006) The Council held a policy debate on REACH at its meeting on 28-29 November 2005. This Council meeting was followed by a meeting of the Council (Competitiveness) solely devoted to REACH on 13 December 2005. At this later meeting the Council reached political agreement on a common position on REACH. This common position will be formally adopted at a forthcoming Council meeting and submitted to the European Parliament in order to prepare for the second reading.
