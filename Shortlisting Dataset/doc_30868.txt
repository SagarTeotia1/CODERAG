WRITTEN QUESTION E-4333/05 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Council (22 November 2005) Subject: The Euro-Mediterranean Association In 1995 the Conference at which the Euro-Mediterranean Association was set up took place in Barcelona. The association set itself some ambitious objectives: to develop the Mediterranean Basin into an area of dialogue, exchange and cooperation in which peace, stability and prosperity would prevail; to consolidate democracy and to uphold human rights; to achieve balanced, sustainable social and economic development; to combat poverty and to promote greater understanding between cultures, and so on. Ten years on, hardly any of those original objectives have been achieved. With a view to the Euro-Mediterranean Summit which is to be held in Barcelona on 27 and 28 November: Is the Council intending to reiterate the political will expressed in 1995 and to give political, technical and financial substance to the entire Barcelona Process? What action does the Council think the Euro-Mediterranean Association should take in order to ensure that economic growth in the area leads — as was intended but has not been achieved — to an extension of democracy and the upholding of freedoms and human rights in the countries of the South? What approach does the Council believe the association should take with regard to immigration policies in the light of events such as those which occurred in Ceuta and Melilla and those which have been taking place in recent weeks in various French cities, and given the tendency displayed by many EU countries to link immigration policies to security and anti-terrorism policies?
