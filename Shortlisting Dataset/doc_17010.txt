WRITTEN QUESTION E-4127/09 by Tomasz Piotr Poręba (ECR) to the Commission (11 August 2009) Subject: Problems with visitors' visas for Roman Catholic clergy in Ukraine Priests and nuns working in Ukraine are issued with Type ‘R’ visas (‘religious’ — intended for clergy and representatives of religious missions), which are valid for one year but allow their holders to remain in the country for only 180 days. When this period expires, type ‘R’ visa holders must either leave the country or register with the Ministry for Internal Affairs, which enables them to remain legally for a further 180 days, but without the right to re-enter the country should they leave. However, persons who stay in Ukraine for a whole year must then spend 180 days outside the country. These rules are unfair to the more than 600 priests and nuns (mainly from Poland) providing care and support to more than 1.5 million Catholics in Ukraine, because they make it impossible for them to perform their clerical and pastoral duties effectively. In the light of the above, will the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Is it aware of the difficulties described above relating to type ‘R’ visas? 2. Has this matter been raised in the course of the dialogue with Ukraine held as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy? 3. Will it seek to persuade the Ukrainian authorities to modify these rules, which discriminate against Catholic clergy (mostly from Poland, in other words from an EU Member State) and to a large extent prevent them from fulfilling their pastoral mission?
