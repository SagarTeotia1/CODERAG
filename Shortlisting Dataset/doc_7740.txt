9999/C Q999 E/005 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0977/04 by John Bowis (PPE-DE) to the Commission (19 March 2004) Subject: Health insurance in the Czech Republic Is the Commission aware that, in the Czech Republic, there is one large and several smaller health insurance companies? Is it also aware that the large company has experienced financial problems? Is it further aware that the Czech Government has authorised the redistribution of premiums from the smaller companies to the large company, without the approval of the policyholders involved? Does the Commission agree that this would appear to be in the interests neither of competition nor of policyholders, and will it raise this issue with the Czech authorities?
