WRITTEN QUESTION E-1496/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (25 April 2005) Subject: One in three Cohesion Fund projects in Greece delayed It has been reported in the Greek press that one in three projects funded in Greece under the Cohesion Fund is either delayed or is running far behind its scheduled completion date. These reports state that, out of a total of 94 projects, only 20 are being implemented smoothly, while at a large conference which took place in the Greek Finance Ministry it was noted that by the middle of March 2005 a mere 32 % of total appropriations had been taken up. Is the Commission responsible for this delay? If not, who is responsible for it and the very low take-up rate?
