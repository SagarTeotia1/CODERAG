ORAL QUESTION H-0177/10 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Peter van Dalen to the Commission Subject: Mass atrocities in Nigeria Is the Commission aware of the most recent mass atrocities having taken place in Plateau State, Nigeria, on 19 January 2010 and 7 March 2010? Is it aware that these mass atrocities are no isolated incidents, but rather part of a continuous cycle of violence between different ethnic and religious groups in central Nigeria? Is it aware of reports that local authorities have sometimes been involved in the violence, and often act only as passive bystanders? Will it urge the Nigerian Government and public authorities to do more to stop the cycle of violence between ethnic and religious groups in central Nigeria by: stepping up security for communities at risk, including those in rural areas; bringing the perpetrators of mass atrocities to justice; and addressing the root causes of sectarian violence, including social, economic and political discrimination against certain segments of the population?
