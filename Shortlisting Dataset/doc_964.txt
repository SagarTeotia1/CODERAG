of Lords' hearing. There was no updating of the earlier scenario document (prepared for the High Court hearing) until the day before the House of Lords' judgment." (Ch.18-47) 2.6 Timeline of acknowledgement by Regulators of concerns about Equitable Life 14.11.1990: " Burt (principal actuary at GAD) expressed concern about the position of the Society, particularly if the market were to fall any further or even remain at its present level. Ranson acknowledged that if the market fell by a further 20% they would “have problems and he would have to consider what action should be taken. Although there were clear concerns, the implication of the memos from both GAD actuaries was that no further action was required ."(Ch.16-11, 23) However, "having been concerned about the position of the Society in 1990 (as reflected in the 14 November 1990 meeting and the correspondence which followed), neither GAD nor DTI appear to have sustained this level of interest in the Society during 1991." (Ch.16-51) 14.05.1992 : " In the margins of the Burt (GAD) memo, one of the supervisory team at DTI noted, in addition, that “Paul Burt thinks they have been paying too much in bonuses." ...

At some stage this letter was passed on to DTI." (Ch.16-77). 04.11.1992 : " Meanwhile the scrutiny report had caused some disquiet at DTI . Roberts commented in manuscript on the report...: “This paints a worrying picture. Overdistribution by a company with a (deliberately) short coverage of its RMM and a (continuing) policy of high equity exposure. I think we should ask GAD for a better assessment of the position and of the options available to the company in the event of a significant further downturn in the market... How long could it continue with present bonuses in the face of a zero yield??" (Ch.16-86) 11.01.1993 : "the Society had applied for and been granted a Section 68 Section 68 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982. order for a future profits implicit item of £360m."
