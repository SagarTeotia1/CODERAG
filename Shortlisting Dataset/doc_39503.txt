Question for written answer E-001939/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Vito Bonsignore (PPE) (20 February 2012) Subject: Question on the use of bisphenol A Bisphenol A (BPA), an organic compound with two phenol groups, is generally used in cans containing drinks or other foods such as ready-made soups or tinned tomatoes. The substance is used to prevent corrosion and renders the metal resistant to the temperatures applied during the sterilisation phase. The University of Harvard conducted a study to establish the effective quantity of BPA released into the contents of the can and then absorbed by the body. The study involved 75 volunteers who followed a diet based on ready-made soups that come in cans containing BPA. After consuming five portions of canned soup, there was a clear increase in the concentration of BPA in urine (from 2 mg per litre to 20 mg) — a rise of 1.221 %. According to the study experts, the increase is temporary and disappears after a few days, but doubts still remain. For instance, it is not known whether the increase in BPA affects health and to what extent; furthermore, the release of BPA into the body could be considerably greater if several different types of food or drink contained in BPA packaging are consumed on the same day. Since last spring, BPA is no longer used in babies’ bottles sold in the EU, although it is still widely permitted in other products such as resins and plastics used in packaging and crockery. In light of these considerations, could the Commission state: 1. whether it intends to carry out a more detailed analysis to ascertain the potential dangers of BPA for humans? 2. if this data is confirmed, what action does it intend to take in order to prohibit the use of cans or packaging containing BPA or other harmful chemical substances?
