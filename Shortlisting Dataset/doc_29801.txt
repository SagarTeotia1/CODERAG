full respect of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external action; 32. Stresses that it is essential to increase volumes of official development assistance for developing countries to 2020 and beyond and also to improve the effectiveness of aid programmes; underlines that strengthening development cooperation is not only a goal in itself, but promotes the emergence of new trading partners for the EU to the benefit of citizens of the EU as well as developing countries; believes that it is vital to ensure that the goal of global poverty eradication is not compromised by other policies of the EU; draws attention to the requirement for such Policy Coherence for Development enshrined in Article 308 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; 33. Insists that, if the Europe 2020 strategy is to be credible, greater compatibility and complementarity is needed between national budgets of the EU 27 Member States and the EU budget; underlines the greater role the EU budget should play in that respect by pooling resources together; considers therefore the the post 2013 EU budget must focus on key policy priorities of this strategy and should aim at increasing the level of EU expenditures to the agreed own resources ceiling of 1.24% of gross national income (in payments) and 1.31% (in commitments); insists that in the short and medium term the Commission makes a proposal before the end of first semester 2010 to revise the ceilings of the current MFF 2007-13 in order to find extra budgetary means to start implementing the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, particularly when it comes to financing the proposed flagship initiatives; points out as well to the need to continue exploring new EU financing instruments such as Eurobonds as well as a new financing system for the EU budget, including a financial transactions tax and green taxes; furthermore, underlines the need for the EU budget and all sources of funding to reflect the need to fund the transition towards an environmentally sustainable economy; 34. Emphasises that a Europe 2020 strategy can be credible only if it is adequately funded; regrets that this issue is not addressed by the European Council nor by the European Commission; underlines in that respect that if a greater EIB intervention or a stronger reliance on PPP (as proposed by the Commission in its communication) can in some soundly economic justified cases prove to be an effective solution, it cannot constitute a ‘one-size-fits-all solution’; furthermore asks the European Commission to assess the role of long-term public or private investments could play to finance infrastructures needed to implement the flagships initiatives proposed in the Europe 2020 strategy, and the need to adapt the European regulatory framework in order to promote cooperation among long-term investors; 35. Takes note of the incentives to strengthen the political ownership of the strategy at national levels; deplores however the lack of proposals to ensure better political ownerships at European level by a strong European legislative agenda; and suggests that the Commission revisits the ‘Community method’ and uses the tools made available by
