EU and Mexican institutions have intensified their high-level contacts, both bilaterally and in the framework of the Global Agreement, C. whereas the deepening of EU-Mexico relations can help enhance the consensus between the EU and its Latin American partners on regional and global issues, D. whereas the Strategic Partnership implies the reinforcement of EU-Mexico relations at two different levels: multilaterally, in terms of mutual coordination on issues of world importance; and bilaterally, via the development of their relations and of particular initiatives, E. whereas strategic partnerships of this nature must also contribute to improving the levels of wellbeing of both the European and the Latin American partners with the goal of achieving more integrated and cohesive societies where the rule of law and respect for the values and principles of democracy and human rights prevail in a climate of solidarity and equality, in line with the Lima decisions, 1. Makes the following recommendations to the Council: a) the EU-Mexico Biregional Strategic Partnership should be conceived following the biregional approach and global vision concerning EU-LAC relations which forms the basis of the Biregional Strategic Partnership agreed in the framework of the EU-LAC summits; b) the privileged mechanisms of political dialogue arising from the EU-Mexico Strategic Partnership should result in a real impetus for relations with and between the various regional integration processes, for the safeguarding of the values and interests of the Strategic Partnership itself, and for the strengthening of multilateralism in the area of international relations; c) the EU-Mexico Strategic Partnership should bring genuine value added to the existing EU-Mexico partnership agreement (the Global Agreement), as well as to bilateral relations; d) the Strategic Partnership should facilitate bridging the gaps now existing in terms of coordination between the partners in the international forums and bodies, going beyond simply drawing up a common agenda and including the coordination of positions on issues of world importance, on the basis of shared interests and concerns; e) it should include clear guidelines on how best to ensure close cooperation with a view to promoting effective multilateralism and reinforcing the UN's capacities for preserving and consolidating peace, while also tackling, in the framework of international law, common threats to peace and security such as trafficking in drugs and arms, organised crime, terrorism and the mafias which profit from illegal immigration, in line with the Lima Declaration; f) there should be a full and regular flow of information from the EU institutions and the Mexican government to the EP and EUROLAT on the state of play regarding the Strategic Partnership and on the monitoring of the actions taken under it; 2.
