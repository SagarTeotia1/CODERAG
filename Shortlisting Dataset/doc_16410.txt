independent experts who are in particular to analyse transnational challenges, such as: (i) different levels of taxation on share values and capital yield in the Member States (double taxation); the most appropriate time to tax share options (exercise of a stock option); tax, moreover, only to be payable when the shares acquired by way of option conversion are sold; (ii) various social security contributions on income from financial participation and investment holdings; (iii) legal questions arising from differences in national laws on securities and prospectuses and labour and social security laws; (iv) blocking periods when employees may not dispose of their shares; (v) cultural differences within Member States regarding the social partnership; (vi) the problem of raising the accession countries’ awareness of employee participation; 24. Reiterates its call for the Commission to set up a working party made up of representatives of the social partners, Members of the European Parliament, experts, and representatives of employee-shareholder associations as well as of networks of companies that apply financial participation schemes, with responsibility for monitoring implementation of the actions proposed in the Communication for the years 2002-2004, and for investigating such future action as may become necessary; 25. Considers that recent developments on the global market call for a clear distinction between financial participation and pension schemes, with strong provisions to protect employees’ acquired pension rights, to be included in the guiding principles; 26. Calls in particular for SME employees with shares in the company where they work to be protected against the company’s bankruptcy, at least during the blocking period, e.g. by insolvency protection and/or bank guarantees, and calls for models of employee participation that are linked to pension plans to contain appropriate insurance for employees and to offset risks through a variety of investments if these are organised externally; 27. Takes the view that participation in productive capacity, capital formation to provide private and company pension schemes and capital formation by employees through home ownership should not be excluded from support; 28. Expects financial participation to improve social cohesion and productivity and to create more jobs; 29. Notes the Commission’s intention to carry out a series of studies on its proposal for the system of employee participation and calls on it to support research which will be concerned, inter alia, with the effect of the system in question on the success of the enterprise, productivity, competitiveness and employment; 30. Starts from the premise that the value added to an undertaking is created by all the factors in production working together; therefore calls for stock options issues not to be reserved exclusively for management, for investigations to ascertain whether share options can be made available to all employees and if so how best to do this, and what forms of or options for participation are available or should be created to allow employees to share in growth and in open and hidden reserves without exposing them to unacceptable risks on the world capital markets (e.g. profit participation rights); 31. Urges that a future concept be explored to offer strengthened partnership structures in financial participation
