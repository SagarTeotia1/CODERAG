stresses in the amendments that Parliament needs to be supplied with proper information so that it can evaluate the agreement. The agreement is to apply for a period of six years from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2013. It repeals and replaces the fisheries agreement between the European Economic Community and Côte d’Ivoire which entered into force on 19 December 1990. The fishing opportunities negotiated by the Community are restricted to highly migratory species: tuna, mainly albacore, skipjack and bigeye, and to a lesser extent swordfish. At the request of the Community, exploratory fishing trips may be carried out under the agreement. If they are conclusive and the sustainable management of Côte d’Ivoire’s fishery resources is not jeopardised, the two parties may decide by common agreement to award new fishing opportunities to Community vessels. The financial contribution is fixed at €595,000 per year, with payment being due on 30 March 2008 at the latest for the first year and on 1 July for the following years. This contribution will be allocated in full to the support and implementation of initiatives taken in the context of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by the Government of Côte d’Ivoire. The annual reference tonnage is 7,000 tonnes. The number of ACP nationals signed on by tuna seiners and surface longliners has been set at 20% of the seamen signed on during the corresponding fishing season.

The European Parliament is convinced that mainstreaming gender into the rural sector is a key strategy not only for the promotion of equality between women and men but also for economic growth and sustainable rural development; The report calls on the Commission to improve statistical data and information as regards this phenomenon and to analyse the patterns of, main reasons for and consequences of the out-migration from rural areas in the EU . The report also calls on the Member States to develop strategies aimed at curbing the out-migration of women in rural areas, especially those who are highly educated.
