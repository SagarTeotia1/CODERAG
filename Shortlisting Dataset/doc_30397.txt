9999/C Q999 E/025 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2867/03 by Brice Hortefeux (PPE-DE) to the Commission (17 September 2003) Subject: Higher education lagging behind In recent years, the difficulties encountered in ensuring that the stability and growth pact is respected have become very obvious. The major European political and economic guidelines have failed as far as growth is concerned. What is more serious, however, is that the EU is not laying the foundations for tomorrow's growth: we are collectively lagging behind in higher education, research and innovation to an alarming degree. While the Americans devote 3% of their GDP to higher education, Europeans allocate only 1.4%. While the USA spends 2.8% of its national revenue on research, the EU spends only 1.9%, and all the indications are that for each euro spent, we get a less-effective return. While the Americans are engaged on building a knowledge economy , we content ourselves with hoping for future success. The immediate prospects are therefore not, as the heads of state proclaimed at Lisbon in spring 2000, of a Europe bouncing back, but a Europe falling even more behind, on a par with its growth. Does the Commission intend to present a fresh action plan to reverse these negative trends?
