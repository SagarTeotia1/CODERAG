Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (22 September 2011) Currently Union law does not prohibit exports to the USA of pharmaceuticals that are used in the lethal injections by the USA penitentiary authorities. The Commission has started the process of reviewing the content of the annexes of Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 and will table its proposal to the regulatory committee in the coming months. In particular, the Commission is examining whether a control of exports of pharmaceuticals used in lethal injections would be a suitable amendment. Further examination of the need to review the scope of the regulation (EC) No 1236/2005, taking into account, inter alia , recommendations set out in the Amnesty International report, will be undertaken during 2012.
