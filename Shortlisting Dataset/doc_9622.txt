Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2011) The budget for the Secretariat of the Union for the Mediterranean was agreed by the Senior Officials of the 43 Members of the Union for the Mediterranean meeting on 12 November 2010. Forecast expenditure for 2011 was fixed at EUR 6.2 million with the understanding that Member States of the Union for the Mediterranean will contribute at least 50 %. In line with the EU’s Financial Regulation, co-financing is a condition for EU funding. The EU's commitment to co-finance up to 50 % of the total budget of the Secretariat from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) is detailed in the Regional Indicative Programme for ENPI South 2011‑13. This document was adopted by the Commission in December 2010, following a favourable opinion by the ENPI Committee and the scrutiny process by the European Parliament. The Commission expects all 43 Members to participate and ensure the firm and lasting funding of the Secretariat.
