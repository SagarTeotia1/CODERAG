that, for reasons of resource efficiency, farmers should be encouraged to make better use of the potential of biogas and biogas by-products to replace fertilisers; 18. Notes that biofuels have a key role to play in the long‑term strategy to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources; calls for greater account to be taken of the diverse potential the raw material wood has as an energy source, a sustainable building material and a carbon pool; 19. Stresses that the Commission’s forthcoming framework for land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) should avoid excessive regulation, which could undermine the EU’s prospects for achieving the climate targets, and, due to Europe’s diversity, should respect the principle of subsidiarity and the role of local and national governments; 20. Stresses the need for increased investment in energy infrastructure, such as smart grids and biogas distribution, to be able to handle the increased cloud energy production from renewable energy sources; 21. Supports the idea that EU funds, including the Rural Development Fund, should only fund projects for agricultural facilities that are energy efficient, especially those employing renewable energy sources that can reduce carbon emissions to a level as close to zero as possible; 22. Emphasises the importance of carbon-neutral farming; urges the Commission to promote this via the greening measures envisaged in the first pillar of the new CAP; 23. Emphasises, to this end, the importance of manure processing, which not only provides renewable energy but also reduces environmental pressure and is a substitute for artificial fertiliser in the form of mineral concentrates; emphasises in this respect that if manure is to be considered as an energy source, it is essential that processed manure be recognised as a substitute for artificial fertiliser in the Nitrates Directive; 24. Stresses that increased research efforts and funding are urgently needed to develop and mainstream climate-efficient agricultural practices, less energy-intensive and less polluting agricultural methods and more efficient energy production; notes furthermore that low-pollution and energy-efficient alternatives already exist; considers research and development in this area to be an essential part of full implementation of the strategic energy technology plan, and that this calls for additional investment; emphasises that it is necessary to ensure, in this connection, that the results of research are translated into practice at the level of holdings; welcomes the Commission’s proposal to establish a new research framework – Horizon 2020; 25. Believes that better livestock feed management, including protein crops in arable rotations and increasing the diversity of protein crops in permanent pasture mixes, in order to grow more animal feed on-farm, would reduce dependence on animal feed imports with a high carbon cost; believes that this would also reduce animal feed costs for farmers, and result in better soil management, by increasing soil water retention, and also reducing susceptibility to pests; 26. Stresses the need to improve energy self-sufficiency on farms, through incentives for on-farm renewable energy, such as wind turbines, solar panels and bio fermentation technology, which would reduce production costs and increase their economic viability by providing an alternative income stream for farmers;
