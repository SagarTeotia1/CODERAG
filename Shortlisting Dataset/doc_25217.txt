WRITTEN QUESTION E-6853/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Council (22 December 2008) Subject: Reward to a FARC terrorist The French Government, presently holding the EU Presidency, has recently offered asylum and a large reward (several hundred thousand euros) to a proven Colombian terrorist of the FARC organisation, who ‘defected’ to France, presumably lured by the vast reward money. How wise is this action by the French authorities? Does the Council not agree with me that offering rewards to terrorists is counterproductive and unethical? Is this how the French Government intents to fight terrorism? And is this a good example to be followed by other EU Member States or third countries?
