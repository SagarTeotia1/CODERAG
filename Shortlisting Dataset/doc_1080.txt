the Directive entails the grant of rights to individuals and it is possible to identify the content of those rights on the basis of the provisions of the Directive. Whether this condition is fulfilled is a matter of interpretation of Community law and therefore falls within the exclusive remit of the ECJ, according to ES 3. In this respect, ES 3 refers to Case C-222/02 Paul and Others v Bundesrepublik Deutschland . In its judgment of 12 October 2004, the ECJ clarified some issues pertaining to the liability of supervisory authorities in the banking sector under the EU harmonisation directives on banking law. The Court held essentially that, although the Directives Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes, First Council Directive 77/780/EEC of 12 December 1977 on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (OJ 1977 L 322, p. 30); Council Directive 89/299/EEC of 17 April 1989 on the own funds of credit institutions (OJ 1989 L 124, p. 16); Second Council Directive 89/646/EEC of 15 December 1989 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and amending Directive 77/780 (OJ 1989 L 386, p. 1). These have now been amended and codified in Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (OJ 2000 L 126, p. 1). impose on the national authorities a number of supervisory obligations, " neither Directive 94/19 on deposit guarantee schemes nor any other banking harmonisation directives ... confer rights on depositors against supervisory authorities in the event that their deposits are unavailable as a result of defective supervision "(ES 3 Page 101. ). It furthermore held that " a rule of national law which provides that a supervisory authority must fulfil its functions only in the public interest and which precludes individuals from claiming compensation for damage resulting from defective supervision is compatible with the EU banking law Directives " (ES 3 Page 101. ). Thus, the judgment in Peter Paul suggests that the Community banking Directives do not provide for an implied right to good supervision and reckons that liability of banking regulators is primarily a matter for national law. " Given the similarities in the prudential supervision of the banking and the insurance sector, it may be said that the judgment also applies to the latter " (ES 3 Page 105. ). However, ES 3 points out that this judgement " does not preclude the possibility that the ECJ may derive individual rights on the basis of other, more specific, provisions of Directives: Implied rights may ... arise ... by specifying in Community provisions the supervisory and monitoring obligations of national competent authorities and the range of interests they are designed to benefit " (ES 3 Page 105. ).
