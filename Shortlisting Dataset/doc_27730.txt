Question for written answer E-009239/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Renate Sommer (PPE) , Monika Hohlmeier (PPE) , Joachim Zeller (PPE) and Axel Voss (PPE) (14 October 2011) Subject: Secondment of Turkish officials as national experts at the Commission In a statement to Members of the European Parliament, the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Egemen Bagis, announced that the Turkish Government and the Commission have signed a memorandum of understanding on the secondment of Turkish officials to the Commission. Under the terms of this agreement, the Turkish officials will be employed at the Commission as national experts and will work together with EU officials to formulate and implement EU policies. In addition, EU Affairs Minister Bagis announced in the statement that through this role as seconded members of staff the Turkish officials will have a role in shaping future EU policy and legislation. 1. Can the Commission say under what contractual terms and conditions the Turkish officials will be employed at the Commission? Will they be temporary officials, and who will pay the salaries of the seconded staff? 2. In which directorates-general or areas of work will the Turkish officials be deployed? 3. In the light of the current behaviour of the Turkish Government, which appears from, among other things, its warnings to Israel and Cyprus to be far from cooperative, what is the Commission's view of EU Affairs Minister Bagis’s statement that with the seconded officials Turkey can influence European policy and legislation?
