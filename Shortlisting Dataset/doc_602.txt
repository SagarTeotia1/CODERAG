WRITTEN QUESTION E-1406/07 by José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (19 March 2007) Subject: Purchase of Endesa shares by Enel — protecting shareholders The Commission's communication ‘Financial services: establishing a framework for adaptation’ (COM(1998)0625) and the Financial Services Action Plan (11 May 1999) seek to reinforce the European financial services sector’s competitive position while at the same time protecting investors’ interests. The Italian company Enel, apparently encouraged by the Spanish and Italian Governments, has decided to buy into Endesa, limiting its purchase to 24.99 % of its capital, so as not to be obliged to launch a takeover bid for all of the shares. This operation could frustrate the takeover bid previously launched by E.On (EUR 38.75 per share) and cause considerable prejudice to the minority shareholders. What does the Commission intend to do to protect the interests of the minority shareholders?
