Answer given by Baroness Ashton on behalf of the Commission (6 November 2009) The EU currently imports about 25 million of passenger car tyres from China, which represent roughly 10 % of the overall EU market for this kind of tyres (220 million units in total). The Commission has to date no indication pointing to increased Chinese exports causing market disruption. When comparing the situation in the US and in the EU, one should also take into account that the American and European tyre markets have different characteristics: average prices are higher in the EU than in the US and there are stringent EU safety rules and standards that all imported tyres must comply with.
