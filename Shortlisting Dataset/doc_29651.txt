Reply (27 October 2010) At its meeting on 19-20 June 2008, the European Council underlined the EU's determination to play its full part in implementing the Declaration agreed in Rome on 5 June 2008 at the FAO High Level Conference on World Food Security to which the Honourable Member refers and to promote a more coordinated and longer-term international response to the global food security situation Document 11018/1/08 REV1. . In this context, in October 2009 the European Community and its Member States, considering that the global food security situation was unacceptable and calling for strong coordinated and holistic action from the international community, promoted the Global Partnership for Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition Document 12481/09. , which was launched at the 26-27 January 2009 High-Level Meeting on Food Security in Madrid. Moreover the Council, after concluding that the European Community and its Member States were convinced that the multilateral system had a key role to play in the fight against global poverty and hunger, supported the ongoing institutional reform of the FAO and in particular the revitalisation of the FAO's Committee on World Food Security (CFS), making it the central component of the Global Partnership. In the run-up to the ‘UN MDG Review High Level Plenary Meeting’ scheduled for 20-22 September 2010 in New York, the Council has supported a comprehensive approach aligned with the ‘Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security’ and has fully endorsed its objectives and priorities. At the same time, the Council has underlined that the EU and its Member States, without prejudice to their respective competences, remain committed to fostering the implementation of the Global Partnership by improving the coherence of the international food security governance system through support to the CFS Document 9653/10. . The future development of the common agricultural policy must be treated as highly relevant with regard to food security and in this context the Council looks forward to the European Parliament's own-initiative report on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security.
