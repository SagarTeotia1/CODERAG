Agreement, is required to effect more than 60% of its investment in the private sector, this being an exception among multinational investment banks, since they usually restrict themselves to lending backed by State guarantees, J. whereas the EBRD bases its investment policy on three principles: making a contribution to the transition process, additionality (the capacity not to squeeze out private sources of finance) and sound banking principles, K. whereas the EBRD's sphere of operations was extended to include the States which emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia; whereas there are substantial differences in the level of investment per capita by EBRD funds in the various countries, with Estonia, Slovenia and Croatia receiving the most resources and Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Belarus and Tajikistan the least, L. whereas the EBRD operates in a highly unstable and changeable environment, which manifests itself in problems such as political instability, economic mismanagement, widespread corruption and nepotism, management of businesses based on State privileges, impoverishment and ineffective public administrations, M. noting and welcoming the fact that the EBRD has given solid support to the candidate countries, which, partly with the EBRD’s help, have now nearly achieved a market economy with free competition, N. reminding the EBRD that it should regularly monitor its organisation so as to ensure that the Bank’s resources are effectively used, Assessment 1.
