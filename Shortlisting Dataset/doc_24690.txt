WRITTEN QUESTION E-2026/10 by Daciana Octavia Sârbu (S&D) , Corina Creţu (S&D) and Cătălin Sorin Ivan (S&D) to the Commission (6 April 2010) Subject: Employees' rights In Romania, against the background of the economic crisis, many employees have been made redundant, in both the public and private sectors, and a further significant increase in unemployment is expected. In this regard, many employees are being forced to work overtime without being paid and are becoming increasingly vulnerable in relation to their employers. The current climate is, without a doubt, favourable to employers; this enables them to exert pressure, which is difficult to punish from a legal point of view. A recent case of a young 34-year old woman in Romania has alarmed the whole of public opinion. The woman was the victim of a cardiac arrest due to overwork and office-related stress and, after several days in a deep coma, she died. This is not an isolated case in Romania: two years before that, another young employee of a multinational company died of exhaustion from having to work overtime. We believe that better control mechanisms need to be established to ensure that employees' rights are respected and that a safe environment should be created in which employees can denounce inappropriate working conditions without the risk of losing their job. 1. Given the above, what measures does the Commission intend to take to limit the abuse of employees and to ensure that their rights under Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, are respected, especially in the current economic and social climate and recession? 2. Will the Commission establish a regulatory body at EU level to work with the national authorities with a view to ensuring that employees' rights are respected, particularly in the large multinational companies?
