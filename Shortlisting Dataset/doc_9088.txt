WRITTEN QUESTION E-1789/05 by Herbert Bösch (PSE) to the Commission (23 May 2005) Subject: Surpluses in the sugar sector With Regulation (EC) No 651/2005 OJ L 108, 29.4.2005, p. 3 . amending Regulation (EC) No 60/2004 OJ L 9, 15.1.2004, p. 8 . the European Commission postponed the deadline for elimination of surpluses in the sugar sector to 31 May 2005. The corresponding quantities must be removed from the market by 30 November 2005. However, the Commission is required to decide on the level of declassification of sugar quotas by 1 October of each year. Because of the postponement of the deadline it will not be possible to ascertain whether the transitional surpluses of the new Member States have been exported at the time of setting the declassification level for the 2005/06 marketing year, leading to uncertainty as regards the level of declassification needed. — Can the Commission say how it intends to take account of the surpluses in setting the level of declassification? In addition, according to press reports from the Reuters Agency on 28 April 2005, there is a growing level of sugar exports from Ukraine to Poland, which should not have come about in this form, given the existing tariff protection and prescribed rate of customs duty. — Can the Commission give further information on these imports? — Can the Commission explain how these imports came about? — Can the Commission say what steps it envisages taking to investigate and/or prevent such occurrences?
