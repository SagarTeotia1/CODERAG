Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (10 February 2012) The Commission is a strong supporter of the existing private-led, multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance which is currently embodied by ICANN. Due to the increasing impact of Internet governance on public policy it is of critical importance that legitimate obligations and prerogatives of public authorities are duly recognised and public policy concerns properly addressed. To achieve this, the Commission has continuously been pushing ICANN to develop into a truly accountable, transparent and internationally representative organisation thus strengthening its legitimacy, particularly with those developing countries that appear to prefer an intergovernmental-type organisation alternative. To this effect the Commission is also in discussion with the US government about improvements and safeguards to be introduced in the future ‘IANA contract’. It considers that the ‘call for proposals’ for this contract (which the US government has recently issued) already contains such improvements. The Commission closely monitors developments related to the enforcement of applicable law in the Internet such as the Stop Online Piracy Act, which targets sites allegedly infringing IPR, regardless of national borders, and therefore could have effects outside the legal jurisdiction of the United States. The Commission will in particular consider the possible implementation of Domain Name System filtering and DNS-level blocking practices and more generally all that could undermine Internet security for all users.
