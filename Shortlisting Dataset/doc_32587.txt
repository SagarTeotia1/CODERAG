Answer given by Mrs Ficher Boel on behalf of the Commission (23 December 2005) 1. The media campaign on Avian Influenza and its possible impact on human health has generated a strong and rapid fall in poultry meat consumption and therefore prices. The Common Market Organisation (CMO) for poultry meat does not foresee any specific instruments such as private storage or buying-in of products to combat a serious market disturbance. Export refunds remain the only instrument in the poultry CMO to support the market. For that reason, the Commission continues to make use of this available instrument. During the last Management Committee on eggs and poultry on 16 November 2005, it has been decided to increase the level of the refunds for hatching eggs and one-day-old chicks. Apart from these measures, it was also decided on 24 November 2005 to grant refunds for chicken cuts for the same destinations as the whole chicken. No export refund had been given for chicken cuts since 2003. This measure should be considered as ad hoc , limited in time, but sufficient to export some accumulated stocks. 2. As indicated above, the crisis situation is of course due much more to a lack of confidence than to any real danger for human health once the product is heat treated. So far, there is no outbreak of Avian Influenza in the poultry flock of the European Union. The consumers should be reassured that there is no risk if they act normally, and prepare correctly the poultry meat. The Commission will continue to monitor closely the veterinary situation.
