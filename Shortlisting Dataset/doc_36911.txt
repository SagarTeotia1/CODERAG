9999/C Q999 E/005 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0117/04 by Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) and Daniel Cohn-Bendit (Verts/ALE) to the Council (14 January 2004) Subject: Elimination of voters from Maltese electoral lists Until last year, the two major political parties in Malta used to go on a voter elimination exercise twice a year, when thousands of rival party voters would be eliminated from the electoral register on the basis of interpretation of residence, mental sanity, etc. On 21 March 2003, the Constitutional Court of Malta, at the request of an injured party, gave a definition of 'residence' (the Cassola Case, Judge Tonio Mallia, Case: Harry Vassallo vs the Electoral Council and John Mary Magro, No. 6/2003/1). The definition given by the Malta Constitutional court says: 'the word "residence" does not mean physical presence in the country'. Moreover, the new law for European elections in Malta, (Act No. XVI of 2003, published in the Malta Government Gazette of 26 November 2003), explicitly states that all Maltese citizens living in the 25 EU countries have a right to vote and stand for elections in Malta. Is the Council aware of the fact that, despite the constitutional definition and the existing legislation on European elections, the Malta Labour Party has again applied to have 1684 Maltese citizens struck off the electoral register? These court cases will start being heard by the Maltese courts in the last week of January, and Maltese employees with the EU institutions are amongst those being targeted. What does the Council intend to do against the illegal attempt of MLP to prevent Maltese citizens taking part in the upcoming European Elections in Malta?
