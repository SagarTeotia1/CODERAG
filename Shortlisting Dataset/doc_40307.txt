ORAL QUESTION H-0546/07 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Bogusław Sonik to the Commission Subject: Protection of patients' rights in the European Union In January 2008, the Programme of Community Action in the Field of Health 2007-2013 will be launched, for which funding of around EUR 365 million has been earmarked. The majority of this funding will be used to eliminate inequalities in access to medical treatment and to promote crossborder health care. An important element of the European Union's health policy, about which there is still some uncertainty, is the protection of patients' rights. Will the programme's provisions also take account of the need to support and mobilise bodies concerned with patients' rights? What financing will the Commission make available to assist associations working to protect these rights?
