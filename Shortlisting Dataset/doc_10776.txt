Joint answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission Written questions : P-3858/07 , E-3993/07 (19 October 2007) On 1 October 2007, the Council of Ministers reached a political agreement on the proposed directive on postal services. Under this agreement, an annex entitled ‘Guidance on calculating the net cost, if any, of universal service’ would be added to the directive. The Commission has stated its intention to assist Member States in the implementation of the future directive (as it has done already on many other occasions in the past).
