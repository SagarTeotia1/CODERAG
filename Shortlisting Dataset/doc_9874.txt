WRITTEN QUESTION E-4152/08 by Paul van Buitenen (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (21 July 2008) Subject: JRC — contracts awarded to Areva In a letter to Commissioner Potočnik of 4 March of this year, the chair of a union representing the staff of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) confirmed that the information which served as the basis for my parliamentary questions concerning administrative inefficiencies in the JRC (E‑0871/08, E‑0872/08 and E‑1021/08) was completely correct and even fell short of reflecting the true seriousness of the situation. Regarding the contracts awarded to Areva, can the Commission make available a detailed list of the contracts awarded to Areva by the JRC over the past five years, including the sums involved and the award procedure adopted?
