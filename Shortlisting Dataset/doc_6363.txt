Reply (14 June 2010) Following a joint statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 4 December 2006 17121/06 Annex II (Statement 235/06). , the Commission submitted on 26 June 2009 a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice 11722/09. . According to Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) OJ L 381, 28.12.2006, p. 4 . and to Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) OJ L 218, 13.8.3008, p. 60 . respectively, the Commission is responsible for the operational management of SIS II and VIS during a transitional period. According to Recital 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006, the transitional period should last for no more than five years from the date from which this regulation applies. Likewise, Recital 4 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 provides that the transitional period should last for no more than five years from the date of entry into force of this regulation. Currently, the date envisaged in the proposal for the future agency to take up its operational tasks is 1 January 2012 Article 34 (2) of the draft Regulation establishing the Agency, see 11722/09. . The preparatory work on the setting up of the Agency should start after the entry into force of the draft regulation. No decision has yet been taken on the distribution of preparatory responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States. This new body is envisaged as a regulatory agency. Estonia and France are officially applying to host the IT agency. The structure of the agency is still under discussion. Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 provide that the SIS II database as well as the central VIS are to be located in Strasbourg (France), with a backup in Sankt Johann im Pongau (Austria). Without prejudice to the provisions on data protection which apply as laid down in the instruments governing the development, establishment, use and operation of SIS II, VIS and Eurodac, the information processed by the Agency in accordance with this regulation will be subject to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1 . . Thus, national data protection rules should have no impact on the choice of the location of the Agency. The Council has not been seized with proposals to extend the management of the Agency to other large-scale
