Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (21 March 2002) The Television without frontiers Directive (Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 199 OJ L 202, 30.7.1997 . 1, (hereafter the TVWF Directive)) provides that Member States shall ensure freedom of reception on their territory of television broadcasts from other Member States (Article 2a(1)). The TVWF Directive is based on Internal Market principles, notably, the application of the rules of the country of origin. The granting of licences for television broadcasting falls within the competence of the Member States, subject to compliance with the general principles of the EC Treaty relating in particular to the freedom to provide services. Also the access to networks and the allocation of frequencies insofar as they are not covered by other Community Directives concerning networks and access (the Electronic Communications package) are within the competence of the Member State. According to Article 25(2) of the TVWF Directive, Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law that they adopt in the fields governed by the Directive. Member States therefore had no duty to inform the Commission on their licensing procedures.
