Question for written answer E-4587/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (22 June 2010) Subject: Statements on Turkey by Robert Gates It has been reported that the US Defence Secretary, Robert Gates, has stated that ‘if there is anything to the notion that Turkey is, if you will, moving eastward, it is, in my view, in no small part because it was pushed, and pushed by some in Europe refusing to give Turkey the kind of organic link to the West that Turkey sought’. 1. Is the Commission aware of these remarks, and if so, what is its opinion on them? 2. Has the Commission contacted Mr Gates on the matter, or does it intend to do so? 3. What position does the Commission intend to take on remarks such as these which seek to make the EU responsible for Turkey's possible shift towards the Middle East and its growing divergence from the western bloc?
