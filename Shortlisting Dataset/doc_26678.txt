for job creation must be made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years. If this condition is not respected, the national authorities shall bear the initial responsibility for investigating this matter and, on the basis of evidence on the conditions of implementation, make the financial corrections required or undertake to recover the aid. This is without prejudice to any other obligations or conditions which the Spanish authorities may have agreed upon with the aid beneficiary, regarding the awarding of the aid. The Community legal framework lays down numerous rules concerning the management of restructuring. In particular, Council Directive 98/59/EC Council Directive 98/59/CE of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies, OJ L 225, 12.8.1998. lays down that an employer who envisages collective redundancies must provide workers representatives with specified information concerning the proposed redundancies and consult with the workers' representatives in good time with a view to avoiding collective redundancies or reducing the number of workers affected, as well as mitigating the consequences through accompanying social measures. Spain has adopted the necessary measures to transpose this directive into its legal order Article 51.1 of the Workers Statute in its current version and Royal Decree 43/1996 of 19 January 1996. . It is, therefore, in principle, for the competent national authorities, notably courts, to ensure the correct and effective application of the national transposing rules in view of the specific circumstances of each case and to ensure the fulfilment of any employer's duties in this regard.
