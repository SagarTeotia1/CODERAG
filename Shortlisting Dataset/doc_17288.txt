WRITTEN QUESTION E-1396/09 by Syed Kamall (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (4 March 2009) Subject: Alexis Sinduhije's situation in Burundi A constituent has brought to my attention the situation of Alexis Sinduhije, a prisoner in Burundi. I am informed that Mr Sinduhije has been incarcerated since his arrest on 3 November 2008. He is the leader of an opposition party in Burundi, the Movement for Security and Democracy (MSD), which places him in a difficult position, as it is illegal to ‘criticise’ the incumbent government or president. In the interests of ensuring a democratic future for Burundi, I would like to bring Mr Sinduhije's situation to the attention of the Commission. Could the Commission: 1. Acknowledge Mr Sinduhije's situation; and 2. Explain what pressure it intends to exert on the Government of Burundi to allow freedom of expression for critics of the government?
