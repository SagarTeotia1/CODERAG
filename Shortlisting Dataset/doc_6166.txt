WRITTEN QUESTION E-1845/06 by Mary McDonald (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (3 May 2006) Subject: Child abandonment in Romania In the Commission’s opinion does the issue of child abandonment continue to pose a problem in Romania? What steps has the Commission taken to rectify this problem? What is the Commission’s view of the situation and living conditions of abandoned children in Romania? Does Romania continue to enforce a ban on foreign adoptions, and is it the Commission’s view that such a ban would conflict with the terms of the Hague Convention on the protection of the rights of the child?
