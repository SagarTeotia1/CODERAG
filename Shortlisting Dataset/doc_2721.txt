9999/C Q999 E/009 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0512/04 by Sérgio Marques (PPE-DE) to the Commission (11 February 2004) Subject: Daphne programme The purpose of the Daphne programme - the 2000-2003 EU programme to combat violence against children, young persons and women - is to help provide a high level of both physical and psychological health protection by protecting children, young persons and women against violence (including in the form of sexual exploitation and abuse), by preventing violence and by providing aid to the victims of violence, with a particular view to preventing further exposure to violence. Public and private organisations and public institutions can all take part in the programme. The Commission cooperates with the relevant institutions and organisations and encourages transnational cooperation between NGOs and local, regional and national authorities. Activities are intended to involve a significant number of Member States. The programme represents the start of cooperation within Europe amongst NGOs and voluntary organisations which, according to the Commission, play an essential role in combating the violence perpetrated against children, young persons and women. The Commission also maintains that such organisations frequently provide services which the public authorities are unable to offer or for which they do not have the necessary skills. In view of the above, would the Commission answer the following questions? 1. How many projects involving Portuguese NGOs or public entities were supported by the Community during the 2000-2003 period? 2. What areas did those projects cover? 3. How much did the projects cost and what was the percentage of Community co-funding? 4. Do projects for which Community support is requested have to be partnerships between NGOs and public entities, or may such projects involve only NGOs?
