of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015, the OSCE Action Plan, and the recommendations of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and Parliament itself; calls for the mobilisation of the Roma community so that inclusion policies can be implemented jointly, as they can be successful only if all parties involved fully participate in them; 12. Calls on the Commission to take a horizontal approach to Roma issues and develop additional proposals to deliver policy coherence at European level regarding the social inclusion of Roma, to prompt Member States to make greater efforts to achieve visible results, to encourage a critical analysis of policy failures, to facilitate exchanges of best practices between Member States and to draw on all the lessons learnt from the Roma pilot project, which should feed into mainstream policies; 13. Encourages the Summit organiser and the EU to define a clear political follow-up to the Summit conclusions, in order to avoid any repeat of previous situations where neither political conclusions nor concrete proposals were adopted; considers that the Summit should not be declarative in nature, but should focus on strategic policy commitments that demonstrate a political will to close the gap between Roma communities and majority populations; 14. Urges the Commission and Council to make use of existing initiatives, such as the Decade of Roma Inclusion, to increase the efficacy of efforts in this area; 15. Considers it essential that a complex development programme be established that targets simultaneously all related policy areas and makes immediate intervention possible in ghetto areas struggling with serious structural disadvantages; 16. Stresses that anti-discrimination measures alone are insufficient as a means of facilitating the social inclusion of Roma, but that a concerted Community effort on a firm legal basis is needed to coordinate measures by institutional and societal stakeholders and to force the parties concerned to honour their own pledges; accepts also, therefore, the need for a clear legislative commitment and credible budgetary appropriations; 17. Recommends that the Council adopt a common position on structural and pre-accession funding, reflecting the European political commitment to exploit the opportunities provided by these funds to promote Roma inclusion and to ensure that the Common Basic Principles on Roma Inclusion are taken into account in any revision of the relevant Operational Programmes, also looking ahead to the next programming period; urges the Commission to analyse and evaluate the social impact to date of investments using pre-accession and structural funds targeting vulnerable groups, to draw conclusions and to devise new strategies and rules if this is considered necessary in this field; 18. Stresses that the candidate countries must be involved in the European-level pursuit of Roma integration as soon as possible, since accession negotiations offer an unparalleled opportunity to trigger a substantial shift in governmental attitudes towards Roma; 19. Insists that Member States must ensure that any measures that have a direct or indirect impact on EU citizens of Roma origin are consistent with the principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and with the Racial Equality Directive that explicitly prohibits direct and indirect
