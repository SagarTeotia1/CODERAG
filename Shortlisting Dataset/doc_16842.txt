WRITTEN QUESTION E-1599/05 by Michl Ebner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (2 May 2005) Subject: Harmonisation of laws on gambling at European level The laws and tax rules applying to gambling vary very widely in Europe. In Italy the Finance Ministry must be notified of gambling activities organised by businesses and the Chamber of Commerce is responsible for monitoring them. A bank guaranty has to be given, guaranteeing that prizes can actually be purchased or distributed. Taxes on gambling run at 25 %, VAT (generally 20 %) is not deductible and the Chamber of Commerce requests a fee for monitoring. On average, 50 % in taxes and fees on the value of prizes may be reckoned with. In contrast, there are apparently no laws on gambling in the Netherlands. In Germany there is also no requirement to notify or pay tax on gambling activities; they are merely required not to contravene certain laws, for example they may not be linked to the purchase of a product, or an alternative to participating has to be offered, entailing no obligation to purchase. Does the Commission intend, in the interests of free movement of services and goods, to seek to harmonise the laws and tax rules applying to gambling?
