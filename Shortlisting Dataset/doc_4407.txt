Question for written answer E-000953/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (3 February 2012) Subject: Community measures as an alternative to detaining immigrants The Jesuit Refugee Service has published a report which looks into alternatives to the detention of refugees. The report shows that the use of such detention is unnecessary and that there are more humane ways to deal with the situation, so-called community measures, whereby a refugee is not deprived of personal freedom. In Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom, asylum‑seekers and irregular migrants were able to move normally within a given community through projects involving such alternative solutions. However, several restrictions were imposed on them. It was explained to individuals and families that if they cooperated with national authorities, their situation would be resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible. An assessment of these projects showed a great effort on the part of asylum‑seekers and irregular immigrants to cooperate, and it was shown that community measures are significantly cheaper for the state than detention, plus they positively contribute to successful integration. What is the Commission’s opinion on community measures as an alternative solution to detention?
