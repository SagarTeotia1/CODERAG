reglèment par Marco Cappato et autres 108 députés The European Parliament , A. whereas international policies on drugs derive from the UN Conventions of 1961, 1971 and 1988 and whereas these Conventions prohibit the production, trafficking, selling and consumption for ends other than medical or scientific ones of a whole range of substances, B. whereas, despite massive deployment of police and other resources to implement the UN Conventions, production and consumption of, and trafficking in, prohibited substances have increased exponentially over the past 30 years, representing what can only be described as a failure, which the police and judicial authorities also recognise as such, Prevention and treatment whereas: - abuse of narcotics and psychotropic substances, particularly by young people, is a serious problem on a global scale, - all the developed nations are seeking better ways of controlling the abuse of narcotics and psychotropic substances, - the long history of prohibition has clearly demonstrated that relying mainly on action taken by the State through criminal law and the police has only a marginal effect in controlling the abuse of narcotics and psychotropic substances, - there is strong evidence to suggest that effective treatment programmes can be successfully developed without State constraints, allowing the broadest possible experimentation in the unending search to improve our ability to assist the victims of narcotic and psychotropic substance abuse, Production and trafficking whereas: - the vast majority of narcotics and psychotropic substances move freely around the world despite prohibitionist laws, - the growing profits that criminal organisations make from trading in illegal substances, which are reinvested in criminal activities or legal financial circuits, have reached such a level that the foundations of legal institutions and constitutional governments are being undermined by them, - the profitability of trading in illicit substances can only lead to a rise in the number of countries involved in drug production and generate massive investment in developing and producing new synthetic drugs, - the main effect of deploying vast resources to curb trafficking in illegal substances has been a rise in their price (criminal tariff) which is of benefit only to organised crime networks, Social and health-related effects and use whereas: - users of illegal substances do not usually have access to reliable information on the composition and effects of narcotics and psychotropic substances, and are therefore exposed to risks (including death by overdose and transmission of the HIV/AIDS virus) which are far greater than the dangers of the substances themselves, - the clandestine nature of illegal substance use is often an insurmountable obstacle to the work of prevention and the provision of assistance by the State and private organisations; current policies thus condemn users to living on the margins of society, in permanent contact with the world of organised crime, - organised crime operates in a way that causes the number of users to increase rapidly, encouraging them to move from relatively inoffensive substances, such as cannabis derivatives, to so-called hard drugs, - great economic need and the enormous pressure from organised crime lead users of illicit substances to become dealers themselves,
