Question for written answer E-005605/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) (14 June 2011) Subject: Presence of toxic microcystin-containing algae in Caldas reservoir (Vilagarcía de Arousa, Galicia) I recently visited the Pontevedran municipality of Vilagarcía de Arousa (Galicia, Spain) together with local residents in order to gather first-hand information about the state of Caldas reservoir, which provides water not only to Vilagarcía but also to Caldas de Reis and other municipalities in the Salnés area. My visit was prompted by concern at the possible presence of toxic microcystin blooms in the local drinking water, a matter I previously referred to in Question E‑1672/07. As summer approaches, it should be noted that rising temperatures cause these algae to reproduce and that microcystin in water used for human consumption is dangerous to health. If no action is taken, the hot weather will accentuate the problem. Since the Commission is already on record as saying in 2007 that it was ‘concerned because cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins (such as microcystins) which can endanger human (and animal) health’, could it verify whether Caldas reservoir complies with the terms of Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption? Could the Commission also provide information on the steps taken to check whether Caldas reservoir complies with the terms of the directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption, which requires water quality to be regularly monitored and monitoring programmes drawn up to guarantee its healthiness and purity? How does the Commission view the creation of an ozone water treatment plant to eliminate the toxic algae? Does it consider this to be an effective means of guaranteeing the healthiness and purity of the area's drinking water? Could the Commission provide information on methods which could be used to eliminate microcystin?
