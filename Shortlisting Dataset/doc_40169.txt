emissions in Europe. Tyres can play an important role in reducing CO2 emissions because they are responsible for 20-30% of the total energy use of vehicles. For passenger cars, more energy efficient tires can save up to 10% on fuel costs. The European car industry has been struggling to survive the financial crisis. Is it really the time to impose additional obligations on the car parts industry? The new system is simple and clear. It provides the industry with no significant additional costs. We believe that the label will be picked up early by quality manufacturers; it works in their case as a recommendation. How will the new rules affect the everyday lives of ordinary European citizens in practical terms? The replacement of used tyres is good for 78% of tyres sold in Europe. Each of us thus has the possibility and responsibility to choose economical tyres. These are good for the environment and for your wallet.
