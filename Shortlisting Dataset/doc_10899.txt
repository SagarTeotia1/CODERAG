Question for written answer P-011698/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Evelyne Gebhardt (S&D) (7 December 2011) Subject: Certificate A1 and short-term postings of up to one week Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and (EC) No 987/2009 on the coordination of social security systems created the legal bases for producing Certificate A1. Since 1 May 2010, it has no longer been possible to use the E101 form to provide proof of liability for social insurance contributions in the Member State of residence. Those concerned complain that the current regulation is impractical in the case of cross-border business trips lasting only up to a couple of days and arranged at short notice. Even though applications for short-term postings of up to one week can be made retroactively, there is a considerable administrative burden involved in issuing Certificate A1. No clear legal clarification has yet been provided as to whether Certificate A1 is even necessary for short-term work abroad. In many cases, employers choose not to issue the certificate, but this can lead to local authorities causing problems regarding the posted worker’s freedom to provide services. It is also sometimes the case that certain insurance benefits provided under statutory accident insurance provisions are only granted if Certificate A1 is presented along with the European health insurance card. Can the Commission confirm the existence of the problems described above? If so, how does the Commission intend to address these problems? Are there plans to simplify the issuing procedure in the case of short-term postings?
