constantly and stocks of seeds in the Community have reached a level likely to affect the balance of the market in seeds. Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organisation of the market in seeds [4], as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2371/2000 [5], provides that the amount of aid must be fixed taking into account the need to ensure a balance between the volume of production required in the Community and the amount that can be marketed. The 1994/95 harvest was the smallest in the past decade and since then three new seed-producers have acceded to the EU, so that the production and export of seeds has increased overall and stocks of seeds in the Community have reached a level which might in certain cases affect the balance of the market in seeds. However, it is necessary to place this observation in perspective, as the same does not apply to small pulse seeds, where the European Union is not managing to achieve self-sufficiency, and this shortfall may become more serious in future with the new needs which could arise from the development of a new common agricultural policy which assigns higher priority to quality and the environment and seeks to meet the Union’s needs for vegetable protein better and pursues a line which will encourage many farmers to alter their crop rotation systems. Moreover, since the 2000 harvest, production has been falling towards the levels of previous years. Justification Production of grass and pulse seeds in the 15-member European Union averaged 240 000 tons between 1995 and 2000. Whereas in 1994 the 12 Member States produced 180 000 tons, in 2000 the 15 produced 270 000 tons. In 2001 and 2002, production is expected to total 260 000 and 240 000 tons (estimates by industry experts). Amendment 3 Recital 1a (new) (1a) The European Union is a net importer of fodder plant seeds: the average deficit of the European Union in the second half of the 1990s was around 15 000 tons for grass, clover and alfalfa seeds. Justification According to Eurostat statistics, the European Union has deficits in grass seeds (an average deficit of 8000 tons between 95/96 and 99/00, or approx. 5% of average consumption in the European Union), clover seeds (an average deficit of 7000 tons, or approx. 50% of the EU’s average consumption) and alfalfa seeds (an average deficit of 1000 tons). These situations are liable to change from year to year under the influence of market trends: the volume and nature of supply of the various species may alter rapidly depending on the areas which seed companies plan for and on yields. Imports into the European Union come mainly from the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Some European firms have branches of their own in those countries, incidentally. Amendment 4 Recital 3a (new) In formulating the implementing provisions, the Commission and the Member States shall ensure that the maximum quantities may be apportioned among the Member States. The Member States shall also ensure, by introducing basic
