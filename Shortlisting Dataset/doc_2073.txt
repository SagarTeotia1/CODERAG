Question for written answer E-004128/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Laurence J.A.J. Stassen (NI) (28 April 2011) Subject: Opening the internal market to Africa In an interview with the Internet news service Euractiv, Commissioner Stefan Füle states that the European Union ought to open its internal market to North African countries such as Tunisia and Egypt. 1. Can the Commission indicate whether this plan relates to the entire internal market and thus covers all free movement of goods, services, persons and capital? If not, why not? 2. Is the Commission aware that, in consequence, free movement of persons would initiate unprecedented mass immigration from North Africa to Europe, with a disastrous impact on Europe? If not, why not? 3. Does the Commission agree that, in view of the enormous political, economic and social disparities between the EU and North African countries, an internal market with those countries is doomed to failure? If not, why not? 4. Does the Commission agree that Tunisia, Egypt and other African countries should a priori never join the European internal market? If not, why not? 5. Does the Commission agree that cooperation between Europe and the African continent should be confined to free trade? If not, why not?
