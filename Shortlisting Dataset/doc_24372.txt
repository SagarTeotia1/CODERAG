Question for written answer E-000972/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President / High Representative) Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (3 February 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Organ trafficking and violence in Sinai There are still many requests for assistance and, consequently, appeals being made by various organisations for an end to the ongoing violence in Sinai. Hundreds of Eritrean refugees are currently in the hands of smugglers. The victims speak of constant ill-treatment, deprival of food, and violence and sexual abuse. The captive refugees are repeatedly tortured in different ways, including electric shocks and branding with various implements. Unfortunately, those fleeing from Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia or Eritrea often disappear without trace. Refugees become victims of human trafficking, which in recent years has reached frightening proportions. In fact, the black market in organs is flourishing in north Africa and the Middle East. Given the commitment on the part of NGOs and international organisations to fighting human and organ trafficking, can High Representative Lady Ashton state what measures the EU envisages with a view to eradicating these heinous practices and putting an end to this wave of violence affecting the border areas and the routes taken by refugees?
