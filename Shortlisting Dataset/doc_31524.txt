WRITTEN QUESTION E-5362/08 by Stavros Arnaoutakis (PSE) to the Commission (6 October 2008) Subject: Preservation and restoration of Byzantine and post-Byzantine monuments According to reports in the local Greek press, 57 Byzantine and post-Byzantine monuments are at risk owing to the lack of funds required to preserve and restore them. According to the Hellenic Society for the Protection of the Environment and the Cultural Heritage, at least five of these monuments are in need of immediate attention. These are the fortress of Nikiforos Fokas on Crete, the monastery of Timos Prodromos at Veria, the Panayia Archatou on Naxos, the Assumption of the Virgin of Megalis Horas at Agrinio and Ayios Ioannis at Galata. 1. Is the Commission aware of this serious matter? 2. Does the Commission know whether the restoration of the above five monuments has received funding from the programmes for 2000‑06? If so, what stage has been reached in the restoration work? 3. What does it intend to do to support measures and actions to preserve and restore these monuments which are part of the cultural heritage?
