Question for oral answer O-0172/2010 to the Commission Rule 115 Manfred Weber , Simon Busuttil , Elmar Brok , Alojz Peterle on behalf of the PPE Group Subject: Implementation of the EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement The visa facilitation agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation entered into force on 1 June 2007 with the objective of substantially facilitating the issuing of visas and simplifying administrative procedures, for both Russian citizens travelling to the European Union and EU nationals travelling in Russia. The agreement reiterated that the objective should be visa-free travel on a reciprocal basis and the Russian authorities have regularly repeated their request that further steps should be taken towards full visa-free travel. However, the prerequisite for such further steps is that the existing agreement on visa facilitation should be fully implemented in a completely reciprocal way and that both the EU Member States and the Russian Federation should honour the commitments it sets out. Does the Commission consider that all the EU Member States have fully implemented the 2007 visa facilitation agreement with the Russian Federation? Does the Commission regard Russia's implementation of the visa facilitation agreement, more specifically as regards Article 10 of the said agreement, as satisfactory, in particular as there is still a requirement for foreigners, including EU citizens, to register with the authorities if staying in a private home? Will the Commission publish an assessment of how the visa facilitation agreement has worked so far and of its impact on people-to-people and business contacts between the EU and Russia? Can the Commission also provide updated information on visa facilitation agreements with other Eastern Partnership countries?
