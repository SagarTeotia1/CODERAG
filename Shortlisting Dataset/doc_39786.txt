Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2010) The EU plays a key role on the global flower market, with a share estimated at approximately 44 % in terms of value of production in 2009. The sector of live plants and products of floriculture has increased over the past decade but has been suffering in 2009 during the economic and financial crisis: production decreased by 1.2 % and exports by 7.7 %. Imports decreased as well, by 6.5 %. As for cut flowers and cut foliage, imports from Kenya, Colombia and Ecuador decreased respectively by 3.4 %, 4.1 % and 1.3 %. It seems that the sector is recovering this year in Member States where general economic recovery takes place. Trade is currently liberalised to a high degree in this sector: approximately 95 % of the EU imports of flowers and live plants are realised with zero duty. As concerns EU exports, the Commission is conducting bilateral negotiations with the aim to reduce import tariffs and existing trade barriers for flowers and live plants. In the framework of the common agricultural policy, the EU supports the sector through the horizontal promotion policy (Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 of 17 December 2007 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries, OJ L 3, 5.1.2008. and Commission Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 Commission Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 of 5 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries, OJ L 147, 6.6.2008. ) and the rural development policy (Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), OJ L 277, 21.10.2005. and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 of 15 December 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), OJ L 368, 23.12.2006. ). Flowers and plants are eligible for co-financed promotion programmes, aimed at highlighting the advantages of EU products, especially in terms of quality and environmental friendliness, both on internal market and third countries. Support to the sector may also be granted in the framework of rural development for actions aimed at improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, the environment and the countryside, the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy. Eligible measures depend on the strategic plan of each Member State. As regards toxic substance and pesticides, the Commission is highly committed to a high level of protection of human and animal health and of the environment including plant health which is guaranteed by current legislation. Trade restrictions are possible when plant health import requirements are not respected. However, no actions are possible to restrict imports related to uses in
