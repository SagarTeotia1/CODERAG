Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (7 April 2005) The Commission has closely followed the enactment and enforcement of the United States (US) Bioterrorism Act (BTA), and has provided its comments and concerns, based inter alia on input received from EU industry, on several occasions and through several channels, including World Trade Organisation (WTO) mechanisms. Following these comments, the U.S. has substantially changed the rules, for example, relating to record-keeping provisions to the benefit of EU companies. Following the full enforcement of the BTA since November 2004, complaints from the EU operators have been very limited with some general claims that small producers of agricultural products may have ceased to export to the U.S. The Commission continues to monitor the situation and is prepared to take any necessary and appropriate measure if the BTA proves to substantially impede trade. Concerning measures regarding investment in telecommunications, the Honourable Member presumably refers to Section 5021 of the 1988 Trade Act, the so-called Exon-Florio Amendment to the Defence Production Act, which authorises the President to investigate the effects on US national security of any merger, acquisition or take-over that could result in foreign control of legal persons engaged in interstate commerce. While the EU understands the wish of the US to take all necessary steps to safeguard its national security, there is continued concern that the scope of application may be beyond what is necessary. In this context, the EU has drawn the attention of the US authorities to the lack of a definition of national security and the remaining uncertainty as to which transactions are notifiable. The Commission has taken a detailed look at the trade implications of the BTA and the Exon-Florion Amendment in its 2004 US Trade Barriers Report, which the Honourable Member can find on the internet at http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/issues/sectoral/mk_access/index_en.htm.
