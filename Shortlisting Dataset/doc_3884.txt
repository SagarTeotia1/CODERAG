WRITTEN QUESTION E-2931/04 by Christoph Konrad (PPE-DE) to the Commission (23 November 2004) Subject: Distortion of competition arising from subsidies to German regional banks 1. How does the Commission view the practice of the German Länder, which, as owners of the regional banks, in effect reverse the banks' payment of interest arrears, determined by the Commission, by refunding the entire sum of the arrears in the form of capital increases or secret deposits? How, in these circumstances, does the Commission intend to enforce European competition law in the German banking sector? 2. Has this kind of ‘neutralisation agreement’ applying to the Landesbank Berlin (and other regional banks) already been looked into as part of the investigation into public subsidies launched by the Commission? If so, how does the Commission justify this arrangement? If not, how does it react to this undermining of its decision? Will it launch fresh investigations?
