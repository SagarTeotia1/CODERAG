WRITTEN QUESTION E-5256/07 by Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM) to the Commission (23 October 2007) Subject: Healthcare system in France French President Nicolas Sarkozy has announced cutbacks on many draining social costs on the economy. One way he is doing this is through the termination of free healthcare to early retirees. This has upset many of my constituents, as expatriates living permanently in France who have done so for in excess of two years and who are aged under 65 will automatically have their right to free healthcare terminated. This essentially means that EU citizens below retirement age and residing in France are not entitled to pubic health insurance cover and have to take out private health insurance instead. Does the Commission agree that the measures taken by the new Sarkozy government discriminate against non-nationals living in France and therefore violate EU Directive 2004/38/EC OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77. ?
