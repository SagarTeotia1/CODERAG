Question for written answer E-001624/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (23 February 2011) Subject: Limits for exposure to electromagnetic radiation from telecommunications applications A report published recently in the scientific journal Reviews on Environmental Health Reviews on Environmental Health (2010; 25: 307-317) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21268443 by scientists from five countries, concluded that the limits for exposure to electromagnetic radiation needed to be substantially reduced. The study found that the combined effect of appliances such as mobile and cordless telephones, mobile telephone aerials, WI-FI systems and Blue Tooth entail a risk ranging from neurological and behavioural consequences to a risk of developing cancer, neurological diseases and reproductive and developmental problems. The study considered that existing limits for electromagnetic radiation, which did not take into account wireless apparatus nor the impact on susceptible groups such as small children and the elderly, were inadequate. It recommends that governments and the World Health Organisation introduce limits lower than those currently in force for exposure of both the general public as well as those professionals exposed to such radiation. I ask the Commission: 1. What limits are currently in force for exposure of the public to electromagnetic radiation, particularly such radiation from wireless systems? 2. In the light of the findings of this study, does it propose to study the introduction of lower exposure limits?
