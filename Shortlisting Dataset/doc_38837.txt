WRITTEN QUESTION E-0786/06 by Stéphane Le Foll (PSE) to the Commission (27 February 2006) Subject: Protection of plant varieties French farmers have expressed their concern as to the future of the derogation granted to them under European rules on plant varieties, which gives them the possibility of using their own crops for sowing purposes. Can the Commission tell us if it envisages abolishing this derogation in the near future by changing the existing rules on this matter?
