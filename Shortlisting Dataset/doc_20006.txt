Question for written answer E-7332/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (15 September 2010) Subject: Flood control Recently, regions which — according to the maps — should not be at all at risk of flooding have been more frequently affected by flooding. If there is a build‑up of intensive storms over a small area, any ditch which only allows a small volume of water to flow through can become a problem. For example, the floods in St. Pölten in the summer of 2009 were not caused by the Traisen but by a ditch which was unable to cope with the volume of water. Mold in the Waldviertel has also already been flooded three times this year, although the village is not situated in a region deemed at risk of flooding. Whilst protection installations along the course of a river and dismantling of regulating work to protect against flooding are successful against the swelling of streams and rivers where rain falls over large areas, a large number of measures are needed in response to the new flood risks. 1. Is the Commission aware of similar problems with heavy rain in particular spots in other Member States? 2. Are there studies at EU level which deal with other causes, such as density of construction? 3. Is there a possibility of EU funding for those areas that are particularly affected in the light of the necessary reconstruction measures?
