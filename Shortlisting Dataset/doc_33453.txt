Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (11 December 2007) The Commission comprehensively addressed the issue of using credit cards as a form of guarantee in the recent response to the Written Question E‑5077/07 by Mr Watson. As regards the potential abuse of privacy law when the card is used as a guarantee, please note that all personal details stated on the card are in any case available for merchants or service providers whenever the payment is made by a credit card. In principle, the concept of a personal credit card implies that the card holder cannot keep its anonymity Please see Directive 95/46/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, OJ L 281, 23.11.1995. . The collection and processing of the customers's personal details in the credit card constitutes a processing activity of personal data subject to national data protection laws implementing Directive 95/46/EC. The entities are obliged to comply with the obligations imposed by national data protection laws, in particular as regard to the obligations of information of data subjects at the time of collecting personal data, the disclosure to third parties of the personal data, the time the information is stored, the right of data subjects to access to their personal data and to have their personal data blocked, corrected or erased in case of unlawful processing. National data protection authorities are competent to supervise and enforce compliance with national data protection laws by those entities.
