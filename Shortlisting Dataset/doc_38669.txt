Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (7 August 2007) The Commission continues to follow closely the progress of the work of the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) and the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP). The Commission is indeed concerned about the shortcomings identified by the IIGEP in its recent statements and is convinced that the IIGEP can not replace an international human rights monitoring mechanism which is needed to deter further violations.
