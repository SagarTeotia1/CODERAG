WRITTEN QUESTION E-1575/09 by Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) and Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (12 March 2009) Subject: Implementation of the Equality Directives, and in particular the existence of an independent equality body in Poland Directives 2000/43/EC OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22. , 2002/73/EC OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 15. and 2004/113/EC OJ L 373, 21.12.2004, p. 37. require establishment of an independent equality body or bodies in Member States. Under the directives, the equality body is responsible for providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints about discrimination, conducting independent surveys concerning discrimination and publishing independent reports and making recommendations on any issue relating to discrimination. 1. Is the Commission aware that in Poland the two institutions responsible for equality — the Government Plenipotentiary for Equal Treatment and Department for Women, Family and Anti-Discrimination (Ministry of Labour and Social Policy) are part of the government and therefore do not meet the requirement that the equality body must be independent? 2. Is the Commission aware that none of the Polish institutions referred to has, as part of its remit, independent equality body tasks outlined in the directives: providing assistance to victims, conducting surveys and making recommendations? 3. How will the Commission guarantee implementation of the Equality Directives in Poland and, in particular, the existence of an independent equality body in Poland? 4. How does the Commission intend to ensure that the Equality Directives are properly implemented in Poland and in other Member States that have not met their responsibilities in is connection? 5. Is the Commission currently conducting proceedings for inadequate implementation or non-implementation of the Equality Directives by any Member State? Is the Commission planning to do so?
