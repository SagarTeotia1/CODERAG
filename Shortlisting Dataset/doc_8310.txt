EU's website www.europa.eu . On 25 January 2010 the Foreign Affairs Council endorsed the High Representative's proposal to set up a small EU Coordination Haiti cell (EUCO Haiti) within SITCEN to facilitate the coordinated deployment of police and military assets from Member States in support of UN MINUSTAH and the overall humanitarian relief effort. To this end it was decided to embed the SITCEN team in Haiti in the Joint Operational and Tasking Centre (JOTC) established by the UN and the international community present in Haiti. The task of the JOTC was to ensure that police and military forces were deployed as efficiently as possible, e.g. to provide security to relief efforts when requested by humanitarian organisations, to clear debris, to maintain critical roads, to assist in constructing shelters, etc. All this contributed significantly to improving the overall situational awareness and the effective use of police and military assets deployed by Member States. The experiences of the SITCEN as a result of the Haiti earthquake were incorporated in the ‘Haiti — Lessons Learned’ letter of 10 June from the High Representative and Commissioner Georgieva to Members of the Foreign Affairs Council.
