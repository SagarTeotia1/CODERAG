WRITTEN QUESTION E-2858/07 by Toine Manders (ALDE) to the Commission (5 June 2007) Subject: Patient safety At the end of last year in the Netherlands, the HARM survey was published. It showed that medicine-related admissions accounted for 2.4 % of all hospital admissions and 5.6 % of acute admissions. Of these admissions, 46 % were classified as potentially preventable. Errors are made in 30 % of medications in the Netherlands, ranging from wrong drug to wrong dose. A report by the pharmaceutical experts group of the Council of Europe published last month indicated that these figures were representative for other EU Member States. It described precisely how harm caused by medication could be avoided, specifically in Europe. 1. Does the Commission agree that it is in the interests of consumers to improve patient safety? If not, why not? 2. If so, will the Commission take measures to improve patient safety? Will the Commission also take account of the aspects and recommendations in the recently published Council of Europe report? 3. In England, the Ministry of Health has advised all hospitals to introduce the GS1 system. This is a set of worldwide open standards which help to make logistic chain processes efficient. Will the Commission study this system or other effective methods and possibly make a similar recommendation at European level? If so, why? If not, why not? 4. In March the Commission completed a consultation on RFID. An RFID system makes it possible to identify products uniquely by remote means using radio signals. Will the Commission in the near future submit a legislative proposal or other instrument to harmonise RFID frequencies? 5. Will the Commission ensure that healthcare products such as medicines and medical aids can be traced effectively between the manufacturer and the patient? Does the Commission agree that such a tracing system would significantly reduce the adverse medical consequences of parallel imports?
