productive capacity and trade-related adjustment, will be addressed; considers that the Council and the Commission should further consider the most appropriate mechanisms of delivery for different categories of support as regards EPAs; 70. Notes that women benefit less from the opportunities presented by trade liberalisation and globalisation, while at the same time they are harder hit by the adverse effects of those phenomena, and urges the EU therefore, in its trade-related assistance programmes, to devote specific attention to increasing opportunities for women to participate in trade, particularly international trade; Monitoring, evaluation, review and Parliament's role in scrutiny and oversight 71. Believes that the OECD/DAC should monitor the global AfT agenda so as to ensure maximum transparency in the management and destination of aid, but agrees with the recommendation of the WTO TF to incorporate AfT into the donor's and/or recipient's WTO Trade Policy Reviews; 72. Reiterates that the Commission should examine the progress made in implementing the measures taken in the AfT area and should submit to Parliament and the Council a bi-annual report (starting in 2008) on implementation and the results obtained and, as far as possible, on the main outcomes and effects of AfT assistance; 73. Requests explicitly that the bi-annual report contain specific information on the history of the measures financed, where appropriate showing results of monitoring and evaluation exercises, the involvement of the relevant partners, and the implementation of the pledges and budget commitments and payments, broken down by country, region and category of assistance; requests that the report also assess the progress made in mainstreaming trade into aid programming and the results achieved with the assistance, using, as far as possible, specific and measurable indicators of its role in meeting the AfT objectives; 74. Stresses that the Commission should submit to Parliament and the Council, no later than 31 December 2010, a second report evaluating the implementation of, and results obtained with, AfT assistance, if appropriate, together with a proposal to increase the budget for AfT and to introduce the necessary modifications to the AfT strategy and its implementation; o o o 75. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments of the Member States, the ACP-EU Council and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
