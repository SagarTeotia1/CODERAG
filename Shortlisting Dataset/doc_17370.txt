Reply (24 October 2011) On the Honourable Member's question about including a strategy for the Carpathian region in the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014 to 2020, the Council would like to point out that in its conclusions on the European Union strategy for the Danube Region, adopted on 13 April 2011 8743/1/11 REV 1. , it stressed that macro-regional strategies are based on the principle of no new EU funds, no additional EU formal structures and no new EU legislation Idem, p. 7, point 5. . In other words, the Council reiterated that the aim of the European Union strategy for the Danube Region was to ensure a more efficient and effective use of existing EU instruments and funds, as well as other existing resources and financial instruments Idem, p. 7, point 6. . Concerning the question of whether the Council intends to ask the Commission to draw up a strategy for the Carpathian region, it should be remembered that it is the European Council which invites the Commission to present new macro-regional strategies 16616/1/07 REV 1, 11225/2/09 REV 2. . The Council is not aware of any such an invitation by the European Council on the development of a strategy for the Carpathian region. Concerning the promotion by the Commission of a long-term coordination of actions by the Carpathian Convention signatory States, the Council would once again refer to its Conclusions on the European Union strategy for the Danube Region, in which it invited the Commission to play a leading role in the strategic coordination of the key delivery stages of the strategy 8743/1/11 REV 1, p. 7, point 15b. . The Council has no intention at present to invite the Commission to take additional steps specifically targeting the Carpathian Convention signatory countries. Concerning the signature and ratification of the Carpathian Convention by the European Union, the Council has not taken any decision in this respect.
