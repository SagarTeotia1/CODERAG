WRITTEN QUESTION P-1438/08 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (7 March 2008) Subject: Shipbuilding in Galicia (Spain) Shipbuilding in the Autonomous Community of Galicia, a region covered by the EU's convergence objective, has a long historical tradition and makes a substantial contribution to GDP through the jobs it creates, making it a strategically important sector for economic and social development. The current international situation is encouraging demand for shipbuilding, as shown by the orders being placed with private shipyards in Galicia. However, although all the necessary resources are available, by all accounts civilian shipbuilding in public shipyards such as Navantia in Ferrol continues to be hampered by the veto imposed by the Commission. In the light of the new and favourable economic conditions and the new orders placed, will the Commission say: 1. Whether it has a veto in this area? 2. Whether it is up to the Spanish Government or the Commission to put forward the proposals needed to resolve this situation, which is so damaging to Galicia's economic and social development? 3. What measures need to be taken to resolve this grave situation, which is undermining Galicia's development and international competitiveness?
