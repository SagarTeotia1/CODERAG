WRITTEN QUESTION E-4424/07 by Pierre Schapira (PSE) to the Commission (18 September 2007) Subject: Funding of the Polish radio station Radio Maryja On 28 August 2007 the Commission announced that the Polish radio station Radio Maryja might receive EUR 15.5 million to expand its school of journalism. This station is known for the anti-Semitic and anti-European stances it has taken. On the eve of Poland's accession to the EU, it campaigned against membership, accusing the EU of a form of ‘moral relativism’ that propagates euthanasia, abortion and homosexuality. Funding this organisation would be contrary to European law and values, particularly in relation to non-discrimination. The Commission's spokesperson, Mrs Von Schnurbein, has stated that the Commission reserves the right ‘to stop the project, if necessary’. When does the Commission intend to publicly disown the project?
