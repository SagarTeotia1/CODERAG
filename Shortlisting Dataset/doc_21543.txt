Question for written answer E-3583/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (25 May 2010) Subject: Statements by Commissioner Almunia In statements made to a Spanish radio station, Commissioner Joaquín Almunia has likened the EU's response to the Greek crisis to ‘running with the ball but not getting anywhere’ and has admitted that the EU was not sufficiently prepared to cope with the crisis and that it had taken ‘forever’ to react. Mr Almunia added that we are now ‘suffering because we failed to control the Greek situation in time’. At a time when credit rating agencies have started again to penalise a number of euro area economies, including Portugal, 1. What measures will the Commission take to remedy the fact that it failed to react earlier to the Greek crisis? 2 How will it ensure that the markets' suspicion of Greece does not spread to other euro area economies, such as Portugal and Spain? 4. How will it counteract the domino effect that the latest Standard & Poor's credit ratings are liable to have?
