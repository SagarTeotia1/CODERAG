Reply (20 October 2008) Pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States. Therefore the Council attaches great importance to the principles of representative democracy and pays particular attention to positions expressed by the European Parliament, most recently in its resolution of 3 September 2008 on the situation in Georgia. The Council does not comment on positions taken by members of the governments of Member States.
