9999/C Q999 E/140 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2458/03 by Concepció Ferrer (PPE-DE) to the Commission (11 July 2003) Subject: High-speed rail network in southern Europe The rail links Genoa-Marseille-Barcelona-Valencia and Lisbon-Madrid-Barcelona-Lyon-Paris are of major importance for the southern European economy. However, repeated delays are holding back the completion of the line between Madrid and Lleida/Lérida, which should have been inaugurated at the end of 2002. This stretch is an essential part of the high-speed link that will connect both Madrid and Barcelona to the French frontier. Meanwhile, the French government appears unwilling to upgrade the stretch between Nîmes and the Spanish frontier to high-speed status. What action does the Commission intend to take to ensure the development of this trans-European network in accordance with the Treaties?
