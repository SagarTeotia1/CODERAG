Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (21 October 2011) The events which have taken place since July 2011 near the French-Spanish border, including demonstrations as well as attacks against lorries transporting fruit and vegetable shipments through France, have been and continue to be attentively followed by the Commission. The incidents described by the Honourable Member can be considered as obstacles against the free movement of goods, being a situation covered by the Treaty provisions on free movement of goods (Articles 34‑36) and by Council Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 OJ L 237, 12.12.1998. . Additionally, EU rules on the market of agricultural goods may also be concerned. The Commission was in contact with the French authorities during the months of July and August 2011. The French authorities provided information about measures they adopted to guarantee the free movement of goods in their territory. The Commission continues to closely follow the situation. It must, however, be underlined that Member States have exclusive competence as regards the maintenance of public order and the safeguarding of internal security as long as the national law and its application respects the principles of efficiency and non-discrimination as developed by the European Union's courts.
