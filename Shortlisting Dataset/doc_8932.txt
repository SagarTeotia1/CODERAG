Ireland peace process into 2005 and 2006 and to make available EUR 50 million for 2005, EUR 45 million of which is to be made available through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument; Heading 3: Internal Policies 7. Welcomes the agreement reached at the conciliation of 25 November 2004 whereby an additional EUR 40 million will be made available for 2005 in order to finance decentralised agencies while safeguarding and reinforcing Parliament's priorities, notably in the areas of the Lisbon Strategy to foster economic growth, sustainable development and job creation, Justice and Home Affairs (including the fight against terrorism) and Communication Policy (including information to citizens and the debate on the future of the Union); 8. Regrets, however, that the Council has hardly accepted any of Parliament's individual amendments and is especially concerned at the Council's unwillingness to recognise fully the consequences of the ever greater share of heading 3 taken up by the decentralised agencies; 9. Decides to enter appropriations for the decentralized agencies at the level of the PDB; 10. Considers, as the 2005 budget procedure has shown, that the Parliament's control at political and budgetary levels will be even more important for future years, as the agencies increase in number and their impact on heading 3 continues to grow; invites, in this respect, the Budgets Committee to maintain its vigilance with respect to other political priorities for the coming years; 11. Confirms its rejection of the drastic reductions proposed by the Council for actions linked with the Lisbon Strategy and adds an additional EUR 62 million above the Council's proposal, of which EUR 42 million will be used for SMEs and EUR 20 million to boost other actions; 12. Has decided to create a pilot project on the "Fight against Terrorism" for an amount of EUR 7 million for its start-up year 2005; calls on the Commission and the Council to do their utmost to support this project which aims at maximising the impact of joint action to combat terrorism at EU level; 13. Confirms the importance it attaches to anti-pollution measures to protect the seas and has entered EUR 17,8 million in both commitment and payment appropriations for the programme managed by the European Maritime Safety Agency; 14. Approves the proposals for the budgetary items linked with the creation of the executive agencies as expressed in Amending Letter 2; Heading 4: External Policies 15. Welcomes the agreement reached on the overall funding for the external policies, including the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 100 million for the financing of reconstruction and humanitarian measures in Iraq; underlines the responsibility of the Union to honour its commitments on a number of crucial issues such as the global fight against poverty, the promotion of human rights and democracy and the links with partner countries around the world; 16. Recalls that this agreement has been achieved without jeopardising other EU external policy priorities; regrets, nevertheless, that the Council’s position has forced some reductions against a few lines where , otherwise, reinforcements proposed in the Parliament's first reading
