Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2011) The EU‑United States (US) Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-crime was established in the context of the EU‑US summit of 20 November 2010 held in Lisbon. The responsibility within the Commission for the Working Group on Cyber-security and Cyber-crime is shared between the Commissioner in charge of the Digital Agenda — responsible for the cyber-security aspects — and the Commissioner in charge of Home Affairs — responsible for the cyber-crime aspects. The Working Group will also involve other EU institutions and bodies and leverage the participation of experts from Member States. Practical arrangements on how the Working Group will be organised are currently under discussion with the US authorities. The initial priorities for the Working Group will include: Public — Private Partnerships (PPP); Cyber Incident Management; Awareness Raising; and Cyber-crime. In addition, this Working Group would consider options for outreach to other regions or countries addressing similar issues to share approaches and related activities and avoid duplication of effort. It could also serve to facilitate a joint approach in international fora.
