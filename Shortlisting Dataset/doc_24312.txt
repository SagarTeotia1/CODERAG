Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (19 October 2010) As indicated in the answers to previous Parliamentary questions on this subject See the answers to Parliamentary questions E‑2542/10 , E‑2543/10 and E‑3365/10 by Mr Allan Kelly (S&D), http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , the Commission is investigating all the aid granted to Anglo with a view to determining whether the aid is compatible with EU State aid rules. Anglo is a distressed bank which has received exceptionally high State support. The Commission has temporarily approved recapitalisations as emergency aid with regard to Anglo (see annex The annex is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. ). These approvals are valid until a final decision is reached. On 31 March 2010, the Commission opened in-depth proceedings regarding the restructuring plan of Anglo See Commission Decision in case C11/2010, Restructuring of Anglo Irish Bank, OJ C 214, 7.8.2010. (pursuant to Article 6 of Council Regulation No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 OJ L 83, 27.3.1999. ). In the decision, the Commission reiterated that Anglo will have to go through deep restructuring in order to minimise distortions of competition and to comply with EU State aid rules. As the Honourable Member is certainly aware, Ireland announced on 30 September 2010 that it plans to split Anglo into a Funding Bank and an Asset Recovery Bank. From a competition point of view, the foreseen restructuring and resolution of the bank addresses competition distortions created by the large amounts of aid at stake. Once the Commission receives the details of the plan from the Irish authorities, it will proceed rapidly towards taking a final decision.
