an independent public body instructed to consider any appeal relating to an alleged violation of the principles; - an obligation on participating firms to compensate for the damage, whether moral or to property, suffered by those involved, in the event of violations of the principles, and an undertaking by the firms to cancel personal data obtained or processed in an unlawful manner; - ease of identification of the steps to be taken to ensure data are cancelled and to obtain compensation for any damage suffered; - provision of a preliminary check by the Commission on the proper functioning of the system within six months of its entry into force and presentation of a report on the outcome of the check and any problems encountered to the working party provided for in Article 29 and the Committee provided for in Article 31 of the Directive, as well as to the relevant committee of the European Parliament; 10. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the operation of the safe harbour system is closely monitored, especially but not only as regards the points raised in Paragraphs 8 and 9 above and to make periodic reports to the working party provided for in Article 29 and the Committee provided for in Article 31 of the Directive, as well as to the relevant committee of the European Parliament; 11. Takes the view that the free movement of data cannot be authorised until all the components of the safe harbour system are operational and the United States authorities have informed the Commission that these conditions have been fulfilled; 12. Calls on the Commission and the Member States: - to provide appropriate information (in the Official Journal and via the Internet) for European citizens on the 'safe harbour', making clear that differences may continue to exist between the 'safe harbour' and European law as regards the processing of personal data; - to set up help-lines (freephone numbers, advice centres) to the relevant national authorities and the Commission to deal with any practical difficulties encountered (e.g. translations of appeals, forms, etc.); - to review the decision in good time in the light of experience and of any legislative developments; 13. Insists that the European Commission append this resolution to its transmission letter to the United States authorities, thereby clearly emphasising Parliament's concern about the absence of an individual right of judicial appeal and the failure of an agreement to oblige companies to pay compensation for unlawfully processed data; 14. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission and the Parliaments and Governments of the Member States.
