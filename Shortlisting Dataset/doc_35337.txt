Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (2 October 2009) The Commission believes that Joint Investigation Teams provide opportunities for European law enforcement cross-border cooperation which have not yet been exploited to the full. Furthermore, the Commission takes the view that Europol's added value, in terms of expertise and analytical capacity, militates in favour of its more systematic participation in Joint Investigation Teams investigating crimes which fall within the Office's mandate. The decision to include Europol within a Joint Investigation Team falls to the Member States setting up the team, even though Europol is entitled to ask a Member State to initiate, conduct or coordinate investigations in specific cases. Member States' cooperation with Europol in the context of a Joint Investigation Team varies from case to case. There are examples of very successful participation, such as in the case of operation GOLF, launched in 2008 by Romania and the UK, with the contribution of both Europol and Eurojust and the financial support of the EU. Its target was the trafficking and exploitation of Romanian Roma children and resulted in the disruption of an organised crime network involved in such crime. In order to encourage Member States to involve the European Police Office in the Teams they set up, the Commission is considering giving priority, in the award of funds, under its dedicated financial programme, to projects which include Europol. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that other forms of transnational police cooperation, such as joint operations or mirror investigations, are also very useful tools in the prevention and fight against serious cross-border crimes in which Europol should be a natural partner.
