WRITTEN QUESTION E-2567/10 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Tackling the crisis in agricultural sectors During the debate in the European Parliament part-session in December 2009 on the ‘crisis in agricultural sectors other than the dairy sector’, MEPs, including the author of this question, called on the Commission to launch immediate initiatives to tackle the crisis facing agricultural sectors in the EU which are in very serious difficulties. In recent letters the farmers’ trade union organisations Copa and Cogeca have sent letters raising the alarm concerning the situation in the following sectors: (a) cereals, (b) fruit and vegetables and (c) olive oil. They have called, as a matter of urgency, for the full activation of the available market management instruments as regards cereals, an immediate improvement in crisis prevention and management in the fruit and vegetables sector and the use of private storage for olive oil. Will the Commission say what measures it intends to take forthwith to support producers and effectively to address the exceptionally critical situation in which European agricultural sectors now find themselves?
