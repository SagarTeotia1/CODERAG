Question for written answer E-7254/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (14 September 2010) Subject: Reopening of the Halki Seminary in Turkey According to the 2009 Progress Report for Turkey, ‘non-Muslim communities — as organised structures of religious groups — still face problems’ and ‘the Halki Greek Orthodox Seminary remains closed, although its reopening was widely debated over the reporting period.’ This constitutes an obstacle to the exercise of religious rights by minorities and the provision of training for clergy. Given that the European Parliament resolution ( P7_TA(2010)0025 ) on the progress report for Turkey ‘repeats its call for the immediate reopening of the Greek Orthodox Halki Seminary’: What measures has the Commission taken with a view to having the seminary reopened? What undertakings have been given in this regard by Turkey?
