energy efficiency agreement; 62. Calls for the Spring European Council in March 2007 to ensure that Europe's future energy policy is backed up by an ambitious R&D strategy in the field of energy, including more adequate public funding and strong incentives for increased private R&D funding; encourages Member States to set out a strategy for increasing the budget for energy research, especially when there is a mid-term review of the EC budget for the Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities (FP7) and for the Intelligent Energy Specific Programme, and therefore welcomes the Commission's proposal that the EU should increase by at least 50% its annual spending on energy research over the next seven years; calls for a European strategic energy technology plan and hopes that it will cover research fields focusing on new energy technologies, such as all renewable energy sources, including wave and tidal power, coal gasification and in particular energy storage, as far as the medium- and long-term prospects are concerned; Creating the internal market for energy 63. Calls on the Member States to recognise that the EU energy market is still not fully liberalised; takes the view that the possible expansion of the regulatory framework must be deferred and that, instead, the implementation of existing EC rules in the Member States must be speeded up; considers that a clear and stable political framework and a competitive energy market are needed to establish a high degree of competitiveness, energy independence, long-term stability, efficiency, environmental sensitivity and security of supply; calls on the Spring Council in March 2007 to provide a broader vision of the common European interest in the energy field, in order to place the completion of the internal market in a clear political framework, something that is currently lacking; 64. Believes that cross-border trade will lead to the elimination of the existing bottlenecks between national markets; urges the Commission and Member States to promote improved cooperation among transport system operators (TSOs), especially in areas such as cross-border capacity allocation, transparency, intraday markets, planning of grids and investments relevant to development of regional markets; calls on the Commission to draw up, together with TSOs, a European grid code ensuring interoperability of national energy grids; 65. Welcomes the Commission proposal for further action aiming to ensure a clearer separation of energy production from energy distribution, through stronger independent regulatory control which considers the interests of Europe as a whole; 66. Believes that consumers must be placed at the centre of all future energy policies and that energy poverty should feature more clearly in the Commission's proposals; recalls that consumers, particularly public authorities, which must set an example in this area, also have obligations in terms of energy saving; recognises the central role that smart metering and billing can play in increasing consumer awareness of how and why energy is being used and therefore in changing consumer behaviour; calls on the Council and the Commission to propose measures which help low income households to achieve energy savings in their homes, thereby reducing their energy bills and their
