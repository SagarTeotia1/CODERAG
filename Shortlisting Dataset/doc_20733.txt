Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2011) The Commission is aware of the statements referred to in the question of the Honourable Member. The Commission has pointed out on a number of occasions and, in particular, in the context of Turkey's progress reports, that missionaries and missionary activities are perceived in Turkey as a threat to the integrity of the country and to the Muslim religion. This does not create an atmosphere conducive to the respect of human rights. The Commission has been following closely developments regarding non-Muslim religious communities in Turkey and has been raising the issues faced by these communities with the Turkish authorities on all appropriate occasions. Turkey, as a country negotiating its accession to the EU, needs to guarantee human rights, including the right to freedom of religion, according to the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights.
