Welcomes the first proposed topic for European Innovation Partnership, on active and healthy ageing, and the suggested approach by the Commission to first run a pilot project testing the most suitable format for these partnerships before launching any further ones; 2. Calls on the Commission, when running the first pilot project on active and healthy ageing, to include social innovation which leads to a better quality of life, prevents disease, improves social networks within public sectors and among social partners, and promotes the introduction of new technologies supporting the quality of life; 3. Stresses that the success of this novel concept lies in having a clear-cut scope and delineation of responsibilities among the various partners involved, precise timelines for the realisation of individual projects, measureable and feasible targets oriented to the market as closely as possible, with simplified administrative procedures relating to implementation and optimum dissemination and access to research findings; in this sense further stresses the central role of the Commission in providing the right operational framework and guidance for the separate projects under the hat of a single partnership; 4. Calls on the Commission, when setting up the governance framework for these partnerships, to make an inventory of existing European and national structures and to assess how to effectively incorporate them into the partnerships without unnecessarily creating new ones; and to ensure adequate participation by smaller innovative companies, universities and research institutions; 5. Urges the Commission to ensure the appropriate and efficient financing of the partnerships, by effectively pooling the resources of the European Union, Member States, regions and other public and private players, while respecting clear criteria and the principles of transparency, openness and equal opportunities with regard to their allocation; welcomes in this context the Commission's Communication on the EU budget review with its strong focus on research, innovation and education; 6. Supports the areas identified by the Commission for the proposed partnerships; calls upon the Commission when launching a partnership to assess the level and extent of ongoing work and the potential of the partnership to deliver the quickest and widest possible results
