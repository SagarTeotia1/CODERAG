WRITTEN QUESTION E-1659/07 by Emilio Menéndez del Valle (PSE) to the Council (29 March 2007) Subject: Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem and confidence-building measures Unesco, an organisation under the aegis of the UN, which is in turn an integral member of the Quartet — has just demanded that Israel stop the archaeological excavations it is carrying out in the immediate vicinity of the Al‑Aqua Mosque in Jerusalem, a sacred site for all Muslims throughout the world. These excavations are unnecessarily causing indignation in the Islamic world. Unesco is recommending that the archaeological work be discussed with all parties involved, and that the dig be carried out under international supervision. Given that the UN is a member of the Quartet, does the Council not think that with a view to establishing confidence-building measures between the parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, it should explicitly support the Unesco demand?
