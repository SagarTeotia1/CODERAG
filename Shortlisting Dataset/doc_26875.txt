form and the degree to which the information from services within directorates-general is incorporated; invites the Secretary-General, as proposed by the Court of Auditors last year (in paragraph 9.16 of the Court's 2003 Annual Report), to harmonise the presentation and structure of the activity reports in the future in order to make them more easily readable and comparable; 38. Calls on Parliament's Administration to forward to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in future, the final version of activity reports, including authorising officers' declarations, together with all annexes; 39. Welcomes the fact that all directors-general have issued a declaration of assurance for their departments' financial transactions; notes that only in one case - concerning procurement in DG Information - was reference made to weaknesses, though they do not represent a reservation; 40. Recalls the proposal made in paragraph 30 of its above-mentioned resolution of 12 April 2005 that for the sake of a better understanding of the true value of authorising officers' signed declarations it would be desirable in future years to adopt a standardised format clearly distinguishing between those matters calling for an 'observation' by the director-general, which do not call into question his declaration of assurance, and other more serious matters justifying a 'reservation'; 41. Notes that the conclusions in the activity reports identify the following general challenges: – putting the internal control framework into practice is more time-consuming than was originally assumed; – difficulties in connection with public procurement procedures; – the continuing need to look for qualified staff for the finance departments of directorates-general and to give current staff further training; – additional difficulties encountered when directorates-general relocate and/or are restructured; The Internal Auditor’s annual report 42. Highlights the fact that the Internal Auditor's annual report and the declarations and activity reports of the Secretary-General and the directors-general constitute a major part of the assessment both by the Court of Auditors and by Parliament's discharge authority; 43. Points out that the internal control systems put in place by the authorising officers by delegation have the following control objectives: compliance with applicable legislation, rules and practices, the reliability of management information and records and the economy, effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 44. Points out further that authorising officers must comply with 22 minimum standards in order to realise those control objectives; notes that those standards can be grouped into five control categories: control environment, performance and risk management, information and communication, control activities and monitoring (audit and evaluation); 45. Notes that, in 2004, the Internal Audit Service produced 13 reports on the internal monitoring and control framework in the directorates-general and examined the financial management of four of Parliament's Information Offices; 46. Highlights the fact that the action plans adopted on the basis of the audit reports permit the following conclusions: – that considerable progress has been achieved in terms of internal control compliance, but full implementation of the new internal control framework will take more time; – that internal control systems should be fully developed and documented in every unit and that, to that end, every unit must have
