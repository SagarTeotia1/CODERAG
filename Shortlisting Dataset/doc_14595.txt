WRITTEN QUESTION E-0945/09 by Saïd El Khadraoui (PSE) to the Commission (20 February 2009) Subject: Nuclear contamination of a tourist destination in Spain (follow-up) I recently put a question to the Commission (E‑6271/08) raising the issue of dangers to public health following the nuclear contamination of a holiday area in Spain. Commissioner Piebalgs' answer stated that the Spanish authorities received a letter from the Commission about this worrying situation on 13 August 2008. The deadline for replying to that letter was 30 November 2008, but the Spanish authorities have still to provide any relevant information. Has the Commission yet received a reply from the Spanish authorities?
