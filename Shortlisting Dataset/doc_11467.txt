Question for written answer E-002376/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (14 March 2011) Subject: Using funds seized from dictators to kick-start the economies of the countries concerned Does the Commission not agree that it would be opportune to adopt legislation similar to the Italian anti-Mafia laws, to set aside the assets and funds seized and confiscated in Europe from dictators from North African countries, for a ‘Marshall Plan’ to the benefit of those countries and to fund the substantial costs of the refugee emergency?
