Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (25 January 2010) Article 16 of the revised European Social Charter stipulates that ‘the Parties undertake to promote the economic, legal and social protection of family life by such means as social and family benefits, fiscal arrangements, provision of family housing, benefits for the newly married and other appropriate means.’ The Charter, adopted by the Council of Europe and referred to in Article 151 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, has been signed by all Member States of the European Union but has not been ratified by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Austria and Poland. The family support measures, to which the Honourable Member refers, cover a wide range. As they fall within the responsibility of the Member States, the Commission does not systematically monitor them. However, the Mutual Information System on Social Protection website http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/missoc_en.htm offers a good overview of social protection benefits in cash and in particular child allowances. Another useful source of information is the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has carried out detailed country-specific analyses of tax and benefit systems for the years 2001 to 2007. The OECD website provides access to ‘country chapters’ giving detailed descriptions of the tax and benefit systems, including the way in which the household composition and in particular the number of children are taken into account http://www.oecd.org/document/29/0,3343,en_2649_34637_39618653_1_1_1_1,00.html . In general, the number of children plays a major role in determining the rate of support granted to families.
