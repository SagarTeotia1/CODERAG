Food Summit’s pledge in 1996 to reduce the number of hungry people by half by the year 2015, – having regard to Rule 45 of its Rules of Procedure, – having regard to the report of the Committee on International Trade and the opinions of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality ( A6‑0179/2006 ), A. whereas combating poverty constitutes an absolute priority, B. whereas the link between trade on one hand and the eradication of poverty and development on the other is extremely complex and depends on particular circumstances which very often have to do with many factors, such as the size of the domestic market, the natural resources endowments, distances and physical conditions, but in particular with the relevance of domestic policies interacting correctly or not with external trade, C. whereas trade is a tool for development and poverty eradication, but over one billion people across the globe mainly concentrated in the least developed countries still struggle in extreme poverty on less than 1$ a day and between 1.5 and 3 billion people live below the 2$ a day poverty line, and whereas these numbers have continued to rise rather than fall over the last few years, although economic growth in China and India has delivered a dramatic reduction in the number of poor so that the proportion of people living in extreme poverty on less than $1 a day has dropped by almost half since 1981, from 40 percent to 21 percent of the global population, D. whereas poverty eradication requires democratic participation and changes in economic structures in order to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth, E. whereas poverty is defined as “a human condition, characterized by the sustained or chronic deprivation of resources, capabilities, choices, security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights”, F. whereas gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in all developing countries rose by 30 percent during the last 25 years but the difference in per capita income between the world’s poorest and richest countries has more than doubled over the same period, G. whereas the high population growth rates in developing countries mean that the rates of economic growth that are being achieved are, in many cases, not sufficient to yield GDP per capita growth rates that will make a major dent in poverty in a number of LDCs, H. whereas civil peace is a necessary condition for a virtuous trade-poverty relationship; whereas good governance, including good management of the revenues from natural resources, is essential for civil peace; whereas an export specialization in some products, notably diamonds, oil, timber and narcotic crops is associated with higher conflict risk; whereas sixty per cent of LDCs have experienced, in the last 15 years, civil conflict of varying intensity and duration that, in most cases, erupted after a period of economic stagnation and regression leaving long-term negative consequences for national and regional economic growth, I. whereas the poorest countries’ share in world trade has
