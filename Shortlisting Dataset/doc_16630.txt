that the Green Paper only partly incorporates the advances made in the European Charter for Small Enterprises; Short-term considerations 6. Stresses that the budget headings relating to the Lisbon Process must be properly implemented if the process is to be implemented on schedule; 7. Notes that implementation of these budget headings is, in volume terms, acceptable, with the exception of research policy (36% as at 31 July 2003), against which there is, furthermore, a significant level of outstanding commitments, equivalent to 185% of the budget allocated to the policy; 8. Expresses concern, nonetheless, about budget implementation in qualitative terms, particularly in connection with very small businesses and the craft trades, for which the Commission appears to be having difficulties in finding appropriate transfer mechanisms, particularly as regards access to EIB/EIF funding for investment in standards compliance, the environment and new technologies; 9. Draws attention to Parliament's request to the Commission to introduce a 'think small first' policy, which should form the priority basis for the action plan that is to follow on from the Green Paper; calls for this action plan to take due account of the ten lines of action set out in the European Charter for Small Enterprises; 10. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the budget implementation rate for Lisbon Process policies, with particular reference to measures for very small businesses and the craft trades, remains high; 11. Considers in this connection that the current financial framework already contains the instruments required to muster additional resources, even at short notice, and that the Commission anyway has considerable budgetary firepower at its disposal in financial perspective heading 3, most of which relates to Lisbon Process policies; Longer-term considerations 12. Considers that measures to promote entrepreneurship and support very small and small and medium-sized enterprises and, in general, all of the Lisbon objectives (knowledge economy, sustainable growth, quality jobs and social cohesion) should play a prominent role in the post-2006 financial framework; calls as of now on the Commission to take account of these factors, to which Parliament will pay extremely close attention during the preparations for the discussions on the next EU financial framework.
