WRITTEN QUESTION E-4233/06 by Nikolaos Vakalis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 October 2006) Subject: Technologies to protect minors from harmful televisual content Technological applications now enable televisions to be ‘locked’ during certain programmes depending on their content. The main aim of such technologies is to protect minors from harmful content (such as violence, pornography) requiring parental consent. By means of an encoded message, transmitted by the television station, relating to each programme's rating, the television stops broadcasting programmes intended only for adults (or which require parental consent). In the USA, for example, since 1999, all televisions larger than 13 inches are required by law to have ‘V‑chip’ technology. This technology has been further developed and, in 2006, the second generation of ‘V‑chip’ for digital receivers appeared on the market in software form under the name of ‘v.gis’. 1. Is any information available about similar systems in the EU and to what extent are they used? 2. Are there, or are there any plans for, studies into the appropriateness of using these systems in the EU? If such studies exist, what were their main findings? 3. What is the Commission's view concerning the promotion of such applications at the technological and regulatory level within the Union (e.g. the introduction of provisions laying down standards for such equipment)?
