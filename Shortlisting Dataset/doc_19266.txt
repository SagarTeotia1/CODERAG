Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (16 January 2007) The Commission's attention has already been drawn to several restrictions to freedom of establishment imposed by the German national law on pharmacies. For instance, the German Pharmacy Act (GPA) reserves the operation of a pharmacy to pharmacists acting as a natural person or in partnership. The difficulties for the establishment of branches of mail-order pharmacies from other Member States mentioned by the Honourable Member are a direct consequence of the abovementioned third party ownership restriction. Furthermore, non-German nationals of one of the other Member States of the European Union can be granted the permission to hold a pharmacy only if they have applied for a pharmacy which has been operated since at least three years. Such restrictions to the freedom of establishment in the area of pharmacies can only be considered as compatible with Article 43 of the EC Treaty if they are non-discriminatory, justified by objectives of general interest, necessary and proportionate to the achievement of those objectives. As mentioned by the Honourable Member, the Commission has already initiated infringement proceedings against other Member States on the ground of similar obstacles (see IP/06/858). Concerning the situation of Germany, if it results from the ongoing investigation that the abovementioned restrictions are not in compliance with the principle of non-discrimination and that they are not justified and proportionate to the objective pursued, the Commission will envisage the opening of an infringement procedure.
