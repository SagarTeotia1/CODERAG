WRITTEN QUESTION E-2998/08 by Giusto Catania (GUE/NGL) , Roberto Musacchio (GUE/NGL) and Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (27 May 2008) Subject: Creation of extraordinary commissioners for the Roma in Italy Italy's Ministry of the Interior announced yesterday that it intended to appoint the Prefect of Milan ‘Extraordinary Commissioner for the Roma Emergency’ in the capital of Lombardy. The appointment is to be made within a week. According to press sources, a similar step could be taken in Rome and Turin as well. Does not the Commission consider that establishing an Extraordinary Commissioner for the Roma criminalises foreign citizens (in many cases, moreover, citizens of the Community) on grounds of their ethnicity? Does not the Commission consider that such a step violates Article 13 of the EC Treaty and Directive 2000/43/EC OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22 . of 29 June 2000 laying down the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of race and ethnic origin? What practical measures will the Commission take to induce the Italian Government to implement correctly all provisions of the above directive?
