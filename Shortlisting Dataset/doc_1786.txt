General background The primary objectives of the European Union include strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion through cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation. Such cooperation also promotes the balanced and harmonious integration and development of the territory of the European Union. To attain the new objective of ‘European territorial cooperation’, the Commission proposes allocating a total budget of € 13.5 billion to cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation for the 2007-2013 period, which amounts to 4% of total Structural and Cohesion Funds for that period and an increase of 14% compared to the 2000-2007 period. The European Parliament has stressed the importance of cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation for European integration Resolution on cross-border and interregional cooperation of 16.05.1997 ( A4-161/1997 , rapporteur: Mr Miller); resolution on cross-border and interregional cooperation of 09.06.1992 ( A3-188/92 , rapporteur: Mr Cushnahan); resolution on cross-border cooperation at the internal frontiers of the European Community of 12.03.1987 ( A2-170/86 , rapporteur: Mr Poetschki). , and the importance of introducing a separate objective for territorial cooperation on the basis of the success achieved by the INTERREG initiative Resolution on the Commission Communication on the third report on economic and social cohesion of 22.04.2004 ( A5-272/2004 , rapporteur: Mr Hatzidakis). . The legal basis of the proposal for a regulation establishing a European grouping of cross-border cooperation (EGCC) is Article 159, third paragraph, of the EC Treaty. This article provides the specific legal basis established by the Treaty to allow specific actions to be taken outside the funds in order to achieve the objective of greater economic and social cohesion laid down in Article 158 of the Treaty. Territorial cohesion, in addition to economic and social cohesion, is referred to several times in the draft European Constitution, and recognised as one of the Union’s objectives and shared competences Articles I-3(3), I-14 and II-96. . Article III-220 of the draft Constitution (the present Article 158 of the EC Treaty) requires particular efforts to be addressed to cross-border regions, among others. 2. Purpose of the Commission proposal The Commission proposal forms part of a legislative package of proposed new regulations on the Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period, comprising a general regulation establishing a set of common rules applying
