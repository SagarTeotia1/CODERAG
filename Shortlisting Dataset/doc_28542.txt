Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2012) TEN‑T funding is based on Regulation (EC) 680/2007 of 20 June 2007 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks. The rules for all payments and an indicative timetable for the commitment of the individual instalments are laid down in this decision. Annual budget commitments and corresponding pre-financings are based on the concrete progress of the projects reported by the beneficiary on a yearly basis. The project ‘Stuttgart 21’ as such is not subject to EU funding but for the Stuttgart-Wendlingen section of high speed line, including several elements of ‘Stuttgart 21’, the Commission decided to allocate a grant of EUR 114.5 million for the present financial perspectives (2007-DE‑17200-P). The maximum co funding is set at 11.6 %. This amount cannot be exceeded and is to be spent on 9 different activities. The grant is conditional on the project being completed by 2014. This is a binding decision for both partners: European Commission and Federal Ministry of transport as beneficiary. Every change of the project as such would need a change or a cancellation of the basic decision. The beneficiary is obliged to report by 31 March of every year. In the light of the next annual report (ASR), the Commission will decide on the next steps. The Honourable Member is invited to consult the Mid-Term Review which was published in 2010 http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/en/ten-t_projects/mid-term_review/ . No further funding decisions are taken on this section. The beneficiary is free to apply for future TEN‑T-funding in the running or future financial perspectives on the basis of concrete calls for proposal.
