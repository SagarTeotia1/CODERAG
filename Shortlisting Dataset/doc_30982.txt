in this connection, that the Member States and all actors involved ensure that workers acquire the basic competences they need; 49. Calls on the Commission to devise instruments such as lifelong learning evaluation schemes to encourage and support workers in systematically pursuing lifelong learning/vocational education and training on their own initiative, paying special attention to those who need to reconcile family and working life, and also in regularly reviewing what skills are needed to continue to operate successfully on the labour market, so as to upgrade their skills and provide job mobility; 50. Calls on the Member States, with a view to reconciling family life and careers and assisting women in rural areas, to offer further training in computer technology so as to give female employees the possibility of working from home; 51. Urges governments to promote flexible VET, geared to the specific needs of organisations and enterprises, that enables all the training accomplished to be turned to good account, the reconciliation of that training with private life and other professional activities, and the boosting of European mobility, with particular emphasis on facilitating access to VET for organisations at risk of marginalisation, so as to prolong their training; 52. Points out that lifelong learning will be crucial if unemployment is to be prevented and due account taken of diverse employment biographies; considers, with that aim in view, that workers must be made more aware of the need for constant further training; 53. Calls on the Commission to draw up a study on the consequences of participating in vocational education and training, both for the productivity of workers and for the competitiveness of enterprises and the quality of the work; 54. Points out that readily accessible, flexible, and individually tailored vocational training is important to people at different times of life, facilitating and improving professional participation in the labour market; considers that vocational and educational training should be accessible, available and affordable at all stages of people's lives, regardless of their status on the labour market or income, and with a view not only to promoting lifelong learning, but also to contributing to the evolution of existing professions and the creation of new ones, based on society's actual needs; considers, furthermore, that it should be regarded as an important instrument for prolonging the whole working life of individuals; 55. Calls on the Member States to develop high-quality, wide-ranging, flexible and affordable access for women to VET, along with specific lifelong guidance and career counselling about qualifications in all types of occupation, addressing women from diverse backgrounds with a view to integrating them effectively into good-quality jobs with decent wages, and tackling their multi-dimensional training needs such as: – customised VET to support career development, – accessible pathways from informal to formal learning, – responsiveness to different learning styles, – access to role models and mentors, – the development of programmes adapted to flexible working arrangements and part-time contracts, – tailored online learning options; 56. Points out that rising population ageing rates in Europe are increasing the importance of lifelong learning and education programmes
