Reply (12 October 2009) The EUMS Intelligence Directorate relies principally on classified contributions from the Member States (MS) Defence Intelligence Organisations (DIO). It also receives information from all ESDP crisis management missions. Public organisations and private businesses do not provide information to the EUMS INT Directorate.
