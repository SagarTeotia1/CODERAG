The summit will begin with an address from the EP President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, followed by a discussion. Opening the debate for the Council, Janez Lenarčič, Slovenia's State Secretary for European Affairs, gave an overview of the three broad areas on the summit agenda: the need for further progress on the Lisbon Agenda; energy and climate change; and instability on the financial markets.

Mr Daul agreed that Europe needs a small business act, and stressed that training, education and lifelong learning are the key to making workers more mobile and flexible. Investing in training and adaptability would also help to relieve the economic pressures of population ageing, he said. On climate change, Mr Daul stressed that Europe must invest in green technology, but must also enjoin its trading partners to do likewise. On social policy, he said that the public must be told the truth - i.e. there will no social progress without economic growth. For the Socialist group, Martin SCHULZ (DE) noted that Ministers were to discuss the idea of a "Mediterranean Union" over dinner, reportedly at France's suggestion. The PES group would welcome this idea, provided that it aims to upgrade the Barcelona process within the EU policy context. However, if the EU were divided over the idea, then it would send a very bad message, and this should
