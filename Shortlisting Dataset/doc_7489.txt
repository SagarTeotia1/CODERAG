WRITTEN QUESTION P-0046/10 by Derk Jan Eppink (ECR) to the Commission (21 January 2010) Subject: Code of Conduct for Commissioners On Monday, 4 January, Commissioner Karel De Gucht made a statement at a meeting of the executive of the ‘Open VLD’ party. He is a member of that executive, which meets every Monday morning. He advocated maintaining a measure to assist trade and industry in Belgium, namely a six-month postponement of the deadline for transfer by businesses to the tax authorities of income tax deducted at source from wages and salaries. His views were at odds with those of the Federal Ministers for Economic Affairs and the Budget, Mr Van Quickenborne and Mr Van Hengel. 1. Does the President of the Commission agree that such a personal and direct involvement in party politics as that displayed by Commissioner De Gucht on 4 January 2010 violates the principles of the abovementioned Code of Conduct? 2. Does the President agree that if a Commissioner is so directly involved, in a personal capacity via party politics, in helping to determine the general policy of the government of a Member State, this jeopardises his objectiveness and independence as a Commissioner and hence those of the Commission? 3. Does the President agree that weekly attendance at party executive meetings detracts from a Commissioner's availability to work for the Commission? 4. Does the President agree that if the Commissioner-designate for trade intervenes in a personal capacity in the adoption of a specific measure by his Member State which will have an impact on trade policy that may place other Member States at a disadvantage (postponement of the deadline for transfer to the tax authorities of income tax deducted at source), this violates the objectivity required by the Code of Conduct, the correct application of which has very important implications for the Commission's reputation?
