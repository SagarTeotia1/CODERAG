demand; expresses concern that the lack of stimulus for low carbon investments and greater energy efficiency risks putting the EU at a disadvantage towards its industrial competitors; acknowledges reports that the carbon price is not expected to increase in the absence of much higher growth or adjustment to the ETS; 22. Recognises the fact that current carbon price will not incentivise investments in low carbon technologies and thus will have a very limited role in driving emission reductions, while risking to lock the EU into carbon-intensive infrastructures for the decades to come; 23. Stresses that climate change mitigation and adaptation policies cannot rely solely upon market-based mechanisms, since these tend to fail to deliver important technologies and to promote the necessary attitudinal shift towards a sustainable society, 24. Calls on the Commission to adopt measures to correct the failings of the ETS and to allow it to function as originally envisaged, in particular by taking the following steps before the end of 2012: (a) recalibrating the ETS before the commencement of the third phase, by setting aside a significant amount of allowances so as to restore scarcity, thus allowing the original objective of providing incentives for investments in low-carbon technologies and energy efficiency measures to be met, and thereafter proposing a legislative act to enable such allowances to be eliminated; (b) proposing legislation at the earliest appropriate date to modify the 1.74 % annual linear reduction requirement so as to meet the requirements of the 2050 CO 2 reduction target; (c) including transport in emissions trading, so as to step up innovation and energy efficiency in that sector, internalise costs more effectively, and create a level playing field between the various transport modes; (d) establishing, from the earliest possible date, a reserve price for auctions of allowances, with that price being set at a level which is below the carbon price envisaged when the current legislation was approved so as to avoid carbon leakage, but is sufficient to provide reassurance for firms making long-term investments; (e) stimulating demand within the ETS by proposing extensions to include emissions from fossil fuels sold from the heat and transport sectors that are not directly exposed to international competition, as also from the maritime shipping sector; (f) taking steps to increase the input of relevant information and the transparency of the ETS registry, so as to enable more effective monitoring and evaluation; (g) further improving the use of offset mechanisms, for example by limiting access to offsets that subsidise Europe’s industrial competitors, as in the area of HFCs; (h) ensuring nonetheless that none of these measures have the effect of reducing the level of allowances allowed for free for the carbon leakage industry in order to meet the benchmark; 25. Notes that these measures will increase the auctioning revenue for Member States, reminds governments that there is no limit on the proportion of such money that can be spent on climate-related purposes, and recommends that the sums concerned be used to spur low-carbon investment in industry or to encourage other means of job creation, e.g. reducing
