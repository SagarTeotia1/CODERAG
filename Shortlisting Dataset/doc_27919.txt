Question for written answer E-009726/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Corina Creţu (S&D) (27 October 2011) Subject: Status of trainees in the European Union According to Eurostat, youth unemployment rates are much higher than unemployment rates for all age groups combined, and unfortunately they have risen further since 2008, owing to the effects of the recent labour market crisis. The youth unemployment rate in the EU‑27 has been around twice as high as the rate for the total population throughout the last decade. High youth unemployment rates reflect the difficulties faced by young people in finding jobs, the lack of appropriate jobs for persons of their (in)experience and the spread of the ‘traineeship phenomenon’. Young graduates without work experience are forced to accept low salaries and to move from one traineeship to another, because organisations today have more to gain from employing the mass of inexperienced young people willing to work harder for less money than from taking on the highly qualified ones able to impose their own salary demands. How will the Commission address this social dumping trend, given that traineeships are coming to replace the real job opportunities that young graduates should have?
