WRITTEN QUESTION E-2595/06 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (14 June 2006) Subject: Security Amnesty International has submitted its 2006 report on human-rights abuse, from which the European Union does not emerge in a good light. In the words of the report, ‘several EU governments continued to attack human rights in the name of security, including through measures that undermined the universal and absolute ban on torture and other ill-treatment (...). Security continued to eclipse observance of fundamental human rights, to the detriment of both issues.’ In the UK, ‘people previously held without charge or trial, labelled “terrorist suspects” on the basis of secret intelligence they were not allowed to know and therefore could not refute, were placed under restrictive “control orders” after their detention had, in 2004, been ruled incompatible with their human rights. Most of them were subsequently reimprisoned under immigration powers pending deportation on national security grounds: many of the men and their families suffered serious deterioration in their mental and physical health as a result of their ordeals.’ In France ‘a draft anti-terrorism law would allow longer periods of incommunicado detention and so would remove safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment.’ What view does the Commission take of the allegations made in the Amnesty International report? Is the Commission aware of those allegations? Does the Commission believe that an investigation into the allegations should be launched?
