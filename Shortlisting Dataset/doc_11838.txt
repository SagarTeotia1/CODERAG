Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (17 February 2009) As the impact assessment has shown that data available are insufficient to allow taking into account the external costs of road accidents, the Commission proposal COM(2008)436 final. for amending Directive 1999/62/EC OJ L 187, 20.7.1999. (the ‘Eurovignette’ Directive) does not foresee the inclusion of accident costs in the calculation of road tolls. Consequently, it does not provide for discounts or reductions on tolls for Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGV) fitted with additional safety equipment. However, positive instruments aiming at promoting road safety and safer vehicles are available. The Intelligent Transport Systems Action Plan MEMO/08/789. which the Commission published on 16 December 2008 as part of the ‘Greening Transport’ initiative will contribute to encourage the deployment of intelligent road safety-related applications in Europe.
