full responsibility in Tampere for the creation of the AFSJ and to define its position with regard to the key aspects of such an undertaking, both in respect of the amendments to the treaties in preparation for enlargement and implementation of the provisions of the existing treaties; recommends, with a view to the above and to the forthcoming meeting in Helsinki, that the following strategies be adopted: Simplifying and streamlining the institutional framework of the AFSJ 3. Calls on the European Council to propose at the next Intergovernmental Conference that police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (currently under the ‘third pillar’) be integrated into the Community ‘pillar’, in order to endow the treaties with legislative coherence, provide for proper democratic control and safeguards of citizens’ freedoms, eliminate unnecessary complications, ensure that EU policies in the areas of freedom, security and justice are genuinely interdependent and, last but not least, make the rules more transparent for citizens; 4. Reminds the European Council that such consolidation need not necessarily involve a change in the current roles of Member States and the Union (since in the Community sphere, it is also perfectly possible for certain areas to be under the jurisdiction of Member States alone and others to be shared between Member States and the Union or be exclusively under EU jurisdiction) and that the consolidation of the first and third pillar is also justified in that - unlike the second pillar – they concern policies that are primarily implemented within the Union; 5. Considers that the five years laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam for the creation of an AFSJ must be seen as a firm deadline; points out that the Treaty allows only minimal involvement for the European Parliament in the decision-making for an AFSJ, and that this must be remedied at the next IGC; Facilitating the EU decision-making process and making it more transparent 6. Considers it impossible to create the AFSJ as long as the Council continues to act unanimously, particularly in the context of future enlargement; suggests, therefore, without prejudice to any measures that the Intergovernmental Conference may consider with a view to extending qualified majority voting to other EU areas of activity, that in order to establish the AFSJ, provision be made for: (a) constructive abstention, in the very few cases in which it is essential to maintain unanimity; (b) the use of the codecision procedure and qualified majority voting for provisions relating to the free movement of persons (Title IV, TEC) and similar provisions regarding the movement and residence of citizens (Article 18, TEC), along the lines of the provisions on the free movement of citizens who wish to engage in an economic activity within the Community; (c) majority voting and more streamlined procedures – without prejudice to the European Parliament’s participation - for the adoption of individual decisions implementing conventions, joint decisions, multiannual plans (e.g. the plan to combat organised crime) and other general measures; this approach follows a basic hierarchy of legal acts and is consistent with Treaty provisions covering other equally ‘sensitive’ areas
