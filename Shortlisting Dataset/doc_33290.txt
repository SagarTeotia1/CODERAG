Question for written answer E-000149/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Vladko Todorov Panayotov (ALDE) (18 January 2012) Subject: Energy projects in Cyprus The explorations in the Exclusive Economic Zone in the south of Cyprus have identified huge quantities of gas and are likely to identify oil also. In one of the plots explored alone, 7 trillion cubic feet of gas are estimated to exist. According to the TEN‑E proposed regulation this project, and the associated ones, should be considered as projects of common interest. How is the Commission planning to support the projects envisaged, including an LNG facility as a first step, and the associated pipelines to the mainland as well as pipelines to transport the gas to the other EU Member States? Taking into account this new development, as well as the Israeli Leviathan project, should not the Commission reconsider the Nabucco project, where the supply of gas is not secure, and instead fully support a purely European project, i.e. the Cyprus project, possibly in cooperation with the Leviathan project? Such a project, and the associated offshore pipelines to bring the gas from Cyprus to the EU, would secure the supply of gas to the EU and constitute a key alternative source of supply. It would also constitute a key competitor to the South Stream pipeline project, with greater added value. Can the Commission state its position on the above points and explain how it plans to make the projects envisaged in Cyprus fully European, including in terms of EU co-financing?
