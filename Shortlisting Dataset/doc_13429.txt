that so many of these forest fires appear to have been started by acts of arson, and is particularly concerned that criminal acts of arson are increasingly to blame for forest fires in Europe. The House calls on the Member States, therefore, to strengthen penal sanctions for criminal acts that damage the environment and, in particular, for those causing forest fires. The House condemns the practice of legalisation of illegal construction on protected and generally non-authorised areas, and urges that all attempts at reducing forest protection via changes to the Greek Constitution (Article 24) be stopped immediately. Finally, the House urges the Member States to ensure that all burned forest areas will remain forests and are covered by reforestation programmes, and that no land use change should be allowed, to implement adequate legislation on conservation and appropriate land use including sustainable farm and forestry practices, water management and efficient risk management and to immediately plan extended reconstruction policies for tourism and the affected local economy. 20070823IPR09756 Joint motion for a resolution on natural disasters Text, as adopted by the EP on 4 September, will shortly be available here For a European civil protection force: europe aid EN 2 LINK /activities/expert/ta/calendar.do?language=EN EN 3 LINK http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/pdf/rapport_barnier_en.pdf -//EP//TEXT MOTION P6-RC-2007-0323 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
