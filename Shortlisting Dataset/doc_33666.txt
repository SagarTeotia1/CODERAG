Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (23 October 2007) The comments and recommendations of the recent report published by BioInitiative diverge from the conclusions of the Commission Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR). The scientific opinion The SCENIHR opinion http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_007.pdf of 21 March 2007 of the SCENIHR of the Commission concludes amongst other issues that for radio frequency fields used in mobile communication no health effect has been consistently demonstrated at exposure levels below the limits of the International Committee on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) established in 1998. However, the SCENIHR also emphasised that the data base for evaluation remains limited, especially for long term low-level exposure. As regards children, the SCENIHR recognised that children and adolescents may be more sensitive than adults, even if no firm scientific evidence exists in that respect, in view of their continuing physiological development and their much higher cumulative exposure than previous generations. Therefore, research on potential effects on children is considered a priority. The Commission is presently considering how to include the SCENIHR recommendations for further research into the 7th Framework Programme of Research and Technological Development. As the conclusions from the current scientific literature diverge in this field, the Commission is preparing a request for the SCENIHR to undertake a critical review of recent reports, published after the release of its latest scientific opinion on electromagnetic fields (EMF). The Commission will carefully examine the results of such comparative assessment in order to identify any new evidence of possible needs for further protection provisions, in addition to those already established.
