Answer given by Mr Monti on behalf of the Commission (16 June 2003) The Commission has not received an application from the British Government for state aid approval to grant the coal mine methane industry an 80 % exemption from the British Climate Change Levy (CCL). The Commission has, however, received a notification from the British Government to grant the production of electricity using coal mine methane a full exemption from the British CCL. The Commission has opened the formal investigation procedure according to Article 88(2) EC Treaty on this notification as it has doubts, at first sight, that the aid granted is compatible with State aid rules. This decision was published in the Official Journal OJ C 69, 22.3.2003, p. 9 . , and third parties were invited to submit comments within one month from the date of publication. The Commission has received third party's comments at the end of April 2003 and forwarded them according to Article 6(2) of the Procedural Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22.3.1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty, OJ L 83, 27.3.1999 . to the British authorities for a reply within one month. The Commission is awaiting the reply of the British authorities and will then take a final decision.
