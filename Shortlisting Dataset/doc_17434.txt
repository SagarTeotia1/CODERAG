Question for written answer E-000959/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (3 February 2012) Subject: Solar Energy in Germany Solar power usage increased in Germany by 60 % in 2011, according to the German solar industry association BSW-Solar. German solar systems generated more than 18 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2011. The sharp increase in production in this sector comes despite a 13 % reduction in state support for photovoltaic installations last year. Subsidies will be further reduced by 24 % in two phases. According to the Federal Association of the Energy and Water Industry (BDEW), the share of all renewable electricity resources reached 19.9 % in 2011, while in 2010 the share of renewable energy resources was 16.4 %. BDEW confirmed that photovoltaic installations were the fastest growing renewable resource in Germany in 2011. In light of these facts, does the Commission plan to make a ‘best practice’ model with regard to solar energy from Germany?
