Reply (27 June 2011) On the basis of the available funds, the General Secretariat of the Council has provided 96 paid traineeships in both 2010 and 2011. In addition to those paid 5-month traineeships, the General Secretariat of the Council provides unpaid traineeships to students in their 3rd, 4th or 5th year (or equivalent) at a higher education establishment or university that requires such a period of training to be undertaken as part of the course of study, or for access to a profession, or for doing research for a thesis or doctorate. In 2010, 20 unpaid trainees were accepted. The number is likely to be similar this year. The traineeships are spread across all the GSC directorates. Trainees' transport costs at the start and end of their traineeships are reimbursed. Their badges entitle them to reductions on the set menu in our restaurant. The length of traineeships undertaken as a compulsory part of studies is set by the student's higher education establishment or university. It is generally between 2 and 5 months and may not exceed 6 months. Most of the students concerned study political science, law, economics, translation or computer science. They are generally in the first or second year of a Masters degree. The Council also provides around ten traineeships each year to national officials. All traineeships organised by the GSC are included in the official programme mentioned in Decision No 118/07 on traineeships http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/Decision%20118.07 %20EN%20sn02323‑re01[1].pdf . The rules set out in that document are applicable to all trainees.
