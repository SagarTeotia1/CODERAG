WRITTEN QUESTION E-6635/08 by Marco Cappato (ALDE) to the Council (16 December 2008) Subject: Drugs In 2009 the United Nations General Assembly will consider a declaration on international drugs policies, 10 years after having launched a set of measures under the slogan ‘A drug-free world. We can do it’, aimed at drastically reducing demand for and the supply of substances banned under the relevant UN conventions. In the meantime, most Member States have introduced or strengthened more pragmatic drugs policies, while in the Netherlands mayors are calling for cannabis production to be regulated. What stance will the Council take at the international conferences to be held in preparation for the General Assembly session in 2009? Would it not agree that the costs and benefits of international drugs policies should be assessed and, where appropriate, changes to the international conventions should be proposed, as called for in several quarters?
