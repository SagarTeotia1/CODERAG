Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2011) Triclosan was evaluated in 2004 by the European Food Safety Authority following an application for authorisation as surface biocide in plastic food contact materials Opinion available on http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/37.htm . Its Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavouring, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food established a restriction of 5 milligram per kilogram of food. The evaluation confirmed previous conclusions by the Scientific Committee on Food. The application for authorisation of use of Triclosan in plastic food contact materials has in the meantime been withdrawn and the substance has not been authorised. Triclosan is used in cosmetic products and an overview of the current situation is given in the answer to Written Question E‑10600/10 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . The Scientific Committee for Consumers Safety (SCCS), which is currently evaluating the substance, is aware of the study mentioned by the Honourable Member.
