Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (26 September 2003) Egg albumin falling under CN subheading 3502 is indeed not included in Annex I of the EC Treaty. Together with other Non Annex I products containing cereals, sugar, milk and eggs it is however eligible to benefit of export refunds for the amount of agricultural products of the four sectors mentioned which are used for their manufacture. In the Uruguay Round the Union agreed to limit its export refunds for agricultural products. These commitments were made separately for the various agricultural product sectors and for Non Annex I products. The recent strong rise of applications for refund licences of Non Annex I products during 2002/2003 has indeed led to ever increasing reduction coefficients (42 % first tranche, 95 % last tranche) in order to respect the Union's World Trade Organisation (WTO) commitments. These reductions were particularly felt by the egg product industry in view of the quite unique position of egg albumin amongst the many Non Annex I products being manufactured from one raw material alone. According to trade statistics available until June 2003, no dramatic drop of export can yet be observed.
