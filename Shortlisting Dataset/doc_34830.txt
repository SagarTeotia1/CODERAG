necessary for the management of the Eurofarm project , shall be set at EUR 43.7 million for the period 2004-2006. The amount of EUR 29 300 000 shall be deemed to be confirmed if it is consistent with the financial perspective for the period commencing in 2007. . The amount for the period 2007-2009 will be fixed by the budgetary and legislative authority on a proposal from the Commission on the basis of the new financial perspective for the period commencing in 2007 The annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective." The annual appropriations shall be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the financial perspective." Justification Whilst the proposal is compatible with the existing financial programming for the period 2004-2006, it seems inappropriate to fix now the amount for the the financial programming for the 2007-2009, due the uncertainties concerning the global financial framework not yet decided. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Background The surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings, carried out at regular - approximately two year intervals - play a key role in agricultural statistics. The Community contribution covers only a small share of the total cost of carrying out the surveys - about 5% of the total costs of a basic survey and about 15% of a sample survey - but is necessary both to partially offset the costs incurred by the Member States in meeting the specific statistical requirements of the Commission and to ensure harmonization of collections methods and of survey characteristics at Community level. In application of Council Regulation (EC) No: 2467/96, amending Regulation (EC) No. 571/88, one census is planned in 1999/2000 and 3 interim surveys, either censuses or sample surveys, in 2003, 2005 and 2007. Member States are paid €20 per holding for which complete survey results are sent to Eurostat, up to a maximum amount established for each Member State on the basis of the number of holdings to be covered. Expenditure on the surveys and expenditure on the EUROFARM project - the database containing the results of the structures surveys - is financed from line 05 08 02 - Surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings (B2-5121).
