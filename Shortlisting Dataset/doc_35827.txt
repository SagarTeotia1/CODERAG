of 2 March 2009 and the public prosecutor's subsequent appeal. · It concluded that both acts constitute objective applications of a principle of national law on sentencing, whereby the fact that a person holds public office is one factor among others which is taken into account in determining the sentence. · Indeed, the judge at first instance, whilst referring to Tobias Pflüger's quality as MEP expressly made the link to the generic quality of public representative and the fact that the offences were committed in public. · In addition, the appeal by the public prosecutor is merely a first stage in an ongoing judicial procedure during which it would not be appropriate to intervene. Bearing this in mind, the Committee has decided not to defend the immunity and privileges of Tobias Pflüger.
