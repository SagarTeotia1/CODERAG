ground, with this mainly concerning those emerging and middle-income countries for which cooperation in the areas of technology, higher education and innovation, and economic cooperation, is of particular importance; – the gradual use of resources under the EU Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights for assistance and programmes aimed at improving governance, democratic institutional structures and the human rights situation in Latin America; – opening up the EU's programmes in the areas of training, education, scientific and technical cooperation, culture, heath and migration to the Latin American countries; – support for programmes of institutional and fiscal reform; – creation of a Biregional Solidarity Fund; – an increase in the budgetary resources allocated, so that these match the major ambitions that have been stated; 22. Calls on the partners to adopt sound and workable policies in the areas of democratic governance, social affairs, public finance and taxation, with the objective of enhancing social cohesion and reducing poverty, inequality and marginalisation; 23. Considers education and investment in human capital to be the basis of social cohesion, economic and social development and social mobility; reiterates its strong support for the creation of a ‘common EU-LAC higher education area’; emphasises that, both in Latin America and in Europe, the state must guarantee access to education, as well as to other public goods (health, water, security); 24.

Believes it essential, for the same reason, to move beyond a purely aid-oriented approach to development cooperation with Latin America, by centring attention on cooperation in the areas of technology, higher education and innovation and on harnessing the resources generated in this area under the Seventh Framework Programme; Developing means of cooperation in the field of migration policies 26.

Requests that priority be awarded, within that dialogue, and especially as concerns the countries of origin and/or of transit of illegal immigrants, to issues relating to illegal immigration and opportunities for legal migration; 28.
