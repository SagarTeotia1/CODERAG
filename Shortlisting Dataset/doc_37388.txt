ORAL QUESTION H-0512/06 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Zdzisław Chmielewski to the Commission Subject: Situation of disabled persons in prisons There is really very little interest shown in the issue of disabled persons serving prison sentences. To all intents and purposes, no EU programme - even those such as the programme to combat social exclusion, the programme to combat discrimination, the employment incentive measures programme, eContent or the European Social Fund - covers the issue of the social rehabilitation of disabled prisoners. Furthermore, very little of substance is to be found in EU documents from 2003 which, as everyone knows, was the year of the disabled. There is thus an obvious need for the Council, Commission and Parliament to address this important issue. I should accordingly like to know what stage has been reached in the drafting of appropriate EU regulations governing disabled persons in prisons. One of the most pressing needs is for appropriate educational programmes to be introduced with a view to enabling such persons to adjust to labour market requirements.
