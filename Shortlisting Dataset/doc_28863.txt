Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (27 March 2008) In application of the principle of subsidiarity, the implementation of Community assistance is the responsibility of the Member States, as stated in Article 8, paragraph 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds OJ L 161, 26.6.1999. . The Member States are not obliged to inform the Commission on every project co-funded by the Structural Funds, unless it is a major project according to Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The Commission is not involved in the selection of projects and in the day-to-day follow up of the implementation thereof and is not in a position to inform on the details of implementation, except on the basis of information solicited ad hoc from the competent authorities of the Member States. Consequently, the question should be addressed to the Greek Authorities. However, the list of projects could also be consulted on the website of the Community support framework of the Ministry of Economy at the following address: www.hellaskps.gr. The Greek Operational Programmes 2007‑13 recently approved by the Commission do not exclude the Church of Greece from being final beneficiary of co-funded interventions. For the time being, the Greek authorities are putting in place the management and control system. Therefore, specific actions are not yet been selected and implemented.
