Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (17 May 2005) 1. As far as the Commission is aware, the so-called isolated solutions which can be observed on the German market of beverages in one-way packaging subject to the deposit, are based on the provisions of the Federal Packaging Ordinance (Verordnung über die Vermeidung und Verwertung von Verpackungsabfällen), more specifically its paragraph 6 (1) restricting the take-back obligation of distributors to packaging of the same ‘type, shape and size’ as the packaging in their product range. Many of the observed island solutions are retailer’s island solutions, but there are also manufacturer’s island solutions such as PETcycle. Both kinds of island solutions use the restriction contained in paragraph 6 (1) referred to above to limit the take-back obligations and accordingly are not compatible with other systems. These island solutions are incompatible with Article 28-30 of the EC Treaty and Article 7 of Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste OJ L 365, 31.12.1994 . . In 2003, the Commission initiated infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty for the Federal Republic’s failure to fulfil its obligations under Article 7 of Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste OJ L 365, 31.12.1994 . as well as Article 28 of the EC Treaty, after receiving more than 50 complaints and letters regarding the implementation of paragraphs 6 and 8 of the Federal Packaging Ordinance. 2. The Commission has received no information on the existence of a blanket ban imposed by the Federal Government on the PETcycle return system. In application of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations OJ L 204, 21.7.1998 . , the Commission received a notification of a draft technical regulation from the Federal Government on 4 November 2004. The draft technical regulation concerned aims to modify the Federal Packaging Ordinance, among other things by providing a specific exception to §6 (1) for one-way beverage packaging subject to the deposit, extending the take-back obligation to packaging of the same material type as those sold by the distributor. The Commission issued comments on this notification pursuant to Article 8 (2) of Directive 98/34/EC. As far as the Commission is aware, the draft technical regulation has not yet been adopted. 3. The Commission has received no information on the existence of a blanket ban imposed by the Federal Government on the PETcycle return system. 4. The Commission is not aware of complaints from German companies or other parties regarding a ban on the PETcycle system. PETcycle as well as other operators have voiced concerns on the draft modification of the Federal Packaging Ordinance.
