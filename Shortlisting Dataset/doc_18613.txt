the fact that the addressees of SMEs' accounts are mainly personal shareholders, creditors, business partners and employees rather than anonymous investors as in the case of public companies, and that the addressees of SMEs' accounts are interested in a long-term business relationship rather than a short-term investment; 48. Calls on the Commission to arrange a proper consultation procedure for a EU accounting framework for SMEs along the lines of normal legislative proposals, and to withdraw its commitment to implementing and adopting an IFRS SME standard as well as preventing parallel application in the EU as long as the EU internal process has not been concluded; encourages the Commission to consider the opportunity for reduction of administrative burden for SMEs in the field of accounting and auditing; 49. Acknowledges, however that there is an overall need for simplification of accounting and auditing measures for SMEs, while recalling that SMEs are creators of jobs and a motor of economic growth; 50. Recalls that the ultimate aim of all international stakeholders must be the adoption of IFRS; acknowledges the tension between the intention of achieving maximum convergence and the desire to preserve the EU's full competence to deviate from the consensus that is globally achievable; emphasises that deviations from global standards should be restricted to the minimum necessary both in the EU and in other parts of the world; takes the view that third countries should deal with EU as a whole and not treat the 27 Member States differently and that the ongoing processes of convergence with existing systems can only be accepted as intermediate stages; Road map for convergence and equivalence 51. Notes the importance and desirability of the establishment of global standards and convergence and recognises that global convergence of accounting standards is proceeding at an ever-increasing pace; 52. Supports the idea of convergence and equivalence; emphasises, however, that convergence with certain third-country standards must be based on a prior assessment of the merits and impact of such a change on EU preparers and users of financial statements and especially on SMEs, and calls on the IASB to bear this in mind when proceeding; believes that convergence would be sufficient if a company's accounts produced in accordance with IFRS could be accepted and recognised under US GAAP without any significant extra cost to companies; 53. Notes that the work on convergence is progressing, and sees a danger that it will be mainly large third countries' economic and company law frameworks which are taken into account in this process while EU frameworks play a lesser role; 54. Notes that on 20 June 2007 the SEC submitted a proposal to the effect that financial statements by foreign issuers should be approved without reconciliation being required, provided that they had been prepared on the basis of the English version of IFRS adopted by the IASB; stresses that the IFRS standards incorporated by the European Union into existing law must be recognised by the SEC; 55. Welcomes the progress made in the EU-US Accounting Roadmap and the recent announcement from the SEC to allow foreign private
