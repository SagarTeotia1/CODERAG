Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (14 December 2010) The Commission stresses that there is no EU‑level legislation regulating which collective agreements concluded at different levels take precedence over which or the possibility of derogating from the minimum standards laid down in national general collective agreements. Although the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU provides that workers or their organisations have, in accordance with EC law and national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate levels Article 28 of the Charter. , it also states that the provisions of the Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing EC law Article 51 of the Charter. . As a result, the issues raised by the Honourable Member fall exclusively within the remit of national law with due regard for the international obligations of the Member State concerned, including the relevant International Labour Organisation conventions. In accordance with Article 152 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, the Union is committed to promoting social dialogue at EU level. In line with those provisions, the Commission has stressed the relevance of social dialogue to EU governance, and it encourages the European social partners and their members to actively participate in, and contribute to, the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy for smarter, greener and socially inclusive growth.
