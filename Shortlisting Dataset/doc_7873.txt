WRITTEN QUESTION E-6093/09 by Philip Claeys (NI) to the Commission (4 December 2009) Subject: Visit to Zimbabwe by Commissioner De Gucht; anti-white racism During the visit to Zimbabwe by Commissioner De Gucht in September, which, according to the Commissioner, took place ‘in a very frank atmosphere’ (website of De Standaard , 13 September), was the situation of the white farmers discussed? Many of them have been forced to leave their farms for purely racist reasons. This has served only to aggravate the famine. During a meeting for young people a few days before the Commissioner's visit, President Mugabe, who had been elected by means of fraud, attacked ‘the bloody whites who want to poke their nose into our own affairs’ (cf. the same newspaper article). Did the Commission express its concern about this anti-white racism?
