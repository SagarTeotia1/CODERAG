9999/C Q999 E/037 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1017/04 by María Sornosa Martínez (PSE) to the Commission (24 March 2004) Subject: Deterioration of the Albufera de Valencia The Albufera de Valencia, a wetland classified as a Special Bird Protection Area and a Site of Community Interest for the Mediterranean area, due to the importance of the species it is home to, continues to suffer from all sorts of attacks on its natural environment. The Commission's reply to written question E-1892/03 OJ C refuses to engage with the issue of the almost ten years' delay in implementing a Guideline Plan for Using and Managing the Park, alleging that Member States could use this protection instrument, or not, since the Member States are responsible for defining the natural conservation instrument for each site on the Natura 2000 network . However, as the Valencian Government itself has recognised Source: Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Territorial Planning and Housing. the Albufera is currently under fresh negative pressure, over and above those I have already denounced, e.g.: - the effluent from a total of 10 wastewater treatment plants, which directly or indirectly end up in the Natural Park, and likewise the arrival of inadequately treated waste, thanks to the ten years' delay in building the treatment system for the Southern Albufera; - polluted industrial and agricultural waters coming from the surrounding areas, which also finally end up within the protected area through natural water courses, thus causing serious eutrophization and loss of biodiversity; - the siphoning off of water from the Albufera, without permission from the appropriate authority, to water the El Saler golf course, etc. There are new difficulties on top of these, of which the Valencian Government has not yet made any statement, such as the impossibility of maintaining the Natural Park's water requirements (established at 100 hm 3 per year), due to the irrigation amounts assigned to the area along the banks of the River Júcar, and the current alarming fall in the flow levels of the Júcar. Given this state of affairs, and the fact that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties: Does the Commission believe that the Spanish authorities are making all requisite efforts to put a stop to the rapid deterioration of this protected area, and counteract the various negative impacts which they themselves recognise the Albufera as suffering? Does the Commission believe that on the basis of what I set out in E-1892/03 , the Spanish authorities are complying with the ruling that they have to provide appropriate natural conservation instruments ? Has anyone appointed by the Commission had occasion recently to check the state of the site of Community interest and special bird protection area in question? Does the Commission not think it would be useful to send a delegate to the Albufera in order to check the state of conservation of this disputably major Natura 2000 wetland?
