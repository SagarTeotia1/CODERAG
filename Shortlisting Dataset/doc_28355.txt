Question for written answer E-8249/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nessa Childers (S&D) (12 October 2010) Subject: Women in clinical trials It is well-recognised that women are not duly represented in clinical trials. Clinical trials for dementia drugs must include a fair proportion of women. Will the Commission make a commitment that the Joint Programming Initiative of research to combat neurodegenerative diseases (JPND) will include a specific focus on women and that the FP8 will have a strand on dementia, including gender-specific research into Alzheimer’s disease?
