Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (12 March 2012) The violent repression carried out by the Syrian regime against their own people has been characterised by large-scale abuses of human rights, including violations of children's rights, as documented in the report of the independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria of 28 November 2011. The EU has consistently condemned the repression and called on the Syrian government to stop violence, ensure respect for human rights, investigate all crimes and abuses and hold those responsible to account. The EU has supported its policy by action, notably by the introduction of restrictive measures against the Syrian regime. The Foreign Affairs Council of 1 December 2011 concluded that ‘the EU will continue to impose additional and more comprehensive measures against the regime, not the civilian population, as long as the repression continues’. As part of its restrictive measures, the EU has fully suspended its cooperation with the Syrian government. However, support for the Syrian people continues by means of several projects including support to human rights defenders at risk and democracy activists. The EU will continue to actively engage with representatives of the Syrian opposition which adhere to the principles of non‑violence, inclusiveness and democratic values. It welcomes the Syrian National Council (SNC)’s commitments in this regard. The High Representative/Vice-President met with the leaders of the SNC on 22 November 2011. The EU will continue to encourage all opposition groups to work on a shared vision for a future Syria. It welcomes the initiative of the Arab League for a dialogue with all opposition groups. The EU stands ready to examine any project in relation to the promotion of a democratic transition that is in line with the agreed policies and instruments.
