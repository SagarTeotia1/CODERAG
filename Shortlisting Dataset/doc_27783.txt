Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2012) Euro area Heads of State and Government have committed on 9 December 2011 to implement a ‘golden rule’ at the national level with a ceiling which is a deficit of 0.5 % of nominal Gross domestic product (GDP). In the same statement, they have explained that ‘Member States shall converge towards their specific reference level, according to a calendar proposed by the Commission’. Article 3(1)b of the Treaty on stability, coordination and governance in the economic and monetary union now specifies that this reference level is actually the lower value of any country-specific medium-term objectives (MTOs) defined by the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) for the Contracting Parties. However, according to Article 3(1) d, when the ratio of the government debt to GDP is significantly below 60 % and where risks in terms of long-term sustainability of public finance are low, the lower limit of the MTO specified above can reach a structural deficit of at most 1 % of GDP. The timeframe for convergence towards the respective medium-term objectives will be proposed by the Commission, taking into consideration country-specific sustainability risks. Member States themselves however will retain responsibility for putting forward their medium-term budgetary plans. The Commission provides Member-States with country-specific recommendations on budgetary aspects through the assessment of the Stability and Convergence Programmes and/or the excessive deficit procedure.
