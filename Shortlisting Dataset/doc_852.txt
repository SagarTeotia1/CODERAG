WRITTEN QUESTION E-1020/08 by Paul van Buitenen (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (29 February 2008) Subject: CATS application at the JRC The JRC has decided to use a new procedure for calculating the working hours of its staff based on this SAP application, at a total cost of several million euros. 1. Is it true that this application is completely incompatible with the Commission's general IT infrastructures and other applications at the disposal of its various services, that consequently it creates a need for the same information to be entered several times and that it is therefore completely unsuited to the requirements of the JRC, and for that reason has been generally rejected both by middle management and the staff as a whole? 2. Is it true that, as the CATS application does not allow for the possibility of entering hours worked over the weekend, staff members are being asked to enter these hours as having been worked during periods when in actual fact they were on leave? 3. If these reports are true, does the Commission regard it as acceptable for its staff to be asked to make false statements concerning their working time in order to overcome the limitations of an IT system chosen, despite its inadequacies, by the JRC itself? 4. Is it true that the adjustments which need to be made to the application to limit the extent of the problems it creates require the intervention of highly skilled experts, thus causing very substantial additional costs? 5. Would the Commission provide complete information about the total cost of the CATS project and the cost-benefit analysis on the basis of which this new application was introduced and clarify its intentions as regards future use of the application?
