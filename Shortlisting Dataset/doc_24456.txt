Reply (4 October 2006) The Honourable Member points in his question to a number of developments which followed the attack on an Israeli army position in the north of Kerem Shalom on 25 June 2006. The Presidency recalled in its statement of 3 July 2006 the situation which had evolved following the Kerem Shalom raid in which it reminded all parties of their responsibility to protect civilian lives and that ongoing military operations should be in accordance with international law. It expressed its regret about the destruction of essential infrastructure which contributed to the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. In an immediate reaction, the Commission provided through the temporary international mechanism fuel for hospitals in Gaza in order to ensure the operation of emergency generators at these hospitals. The Council maintains its view that the political process, as laid down in the roadmap, represents the only route to achieving a negotiated two-State solution agreed between the parties which would result in a viable, contiguous and independent Palestinian State existing side-by-side in peace with an Israel living within recognised and secure borders. A possible suspension of the EU‑Israel association agreement, as raised by the Honourable Member, would not serve this objective. The European Union remains particularly concerned about the detention of elected members of the Palestinian Government and legislature and calls for their immediate release.
