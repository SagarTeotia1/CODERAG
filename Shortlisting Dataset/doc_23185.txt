WRITTEN QUESTION E-2685/07 by Marco Cappato (ALDE) , Pasqualina Napoletano (PSE) , Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) and Giusto Catania (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (24 May 2007) Subject: National Conference on the Family The Italian Government is holding a ‘National Conference on the Family’ from 24 to 26 May 2007 in Florence, aimed at establishing the first national plan for the family and launching a ‘European Alliance for the Family’, which Italy, France, Denmark and the Czech Republic have joined. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations have been excluded from the Conference despite the fact that they deal with love-based relationships between individuals and that the government has tabled a bill to guarantee rights and duties and to lay down rules governing the situation of persons linked by emotional ties, irrespective of gender, as repeatedly called for by the EP. Does the Commission not consider that the exclusion of such organisations from the Conference is sending out a signal which runs contrary to the anti-discrimination campaign of the Commission and the European Parliament, as well as the aim of combating all forms of discrimination which is being promoted by the ‘2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All’, Article 13 of the EC Treaty and Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
