ORAL QUESTION H-0411/05 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Saïd El Khadraoui to the Commission Subject: Communication from the Commission - The new generation of Community education and training programmes after 2006 ( COM(2004)0156 final) In 2000, a study was carried out for the Commission concerning a flexible system to finance the additional costs incurred by students studying abroad. The study presented a system which would combine student grants and loans. In view of the importance of mobility of students and the need for additional funding, as mentioned in the Böge report on the Financial Perspective, I would like to put the following questions to the Commission. Why was the idea of flexible funding of students not included in the Commission's communication on the new programmes in the field of education and vocational training? Is the Commission aware of the EIB's pilot projects relating to student loans in Italy and Hungary? Will the Commission devise a supplementary system of student loans - perhaps in cooperation with the EIB - and if so, how soon?
