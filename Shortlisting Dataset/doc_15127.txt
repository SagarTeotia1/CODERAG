Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2012) The Commission is not aware of the specific case reported by the Honourable Member. The Commission is committed to developing a strong policy response to combat all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence and honour crime as confirmed in the Stockholm Programme and the strategy for equality between women and men (2010‑15). In 2010, the Commission carried out a feasibility study to assess the possibility and appropriateness of standardising national legislation on violence against women, violence against children and sexual orientation violence http://ec.europa.eu/justice/funding/daphne3/daphne_feasibility_study_2010_en.pdf . The study includes a comparative analysis of Member State legislation and practices on ‘harmful traditional practices’ including honour crimes and shows that this form of violence is addressed to a varying degree in the different Member States. The Commission works for the empowerment of women, awareness raising, the promotion of exchanges of good practices and the improvement of collection of data on violence against women. The Daphne III Programme provides financial support for the implementation of transnational projects to grass roots organisations working to prevent such practices by raising awareness and changing social attitudes. The Commission is also taking measures in the criminal justice area and has put in place legislation on the rights of victims of crime.
