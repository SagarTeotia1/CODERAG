is crucial that European citizens be better informed about the activities of the European institutions and how European legislation can influence their daily lives; is willing, therefore, to support measures by institutions to increase awareness in the general public; requests the interinstitutional working party (GII) to put forward a set of media action proposals by September 2003 for the creation of a public media space in the Community; expects the Commission not to deviate from decisions taken by Parliament in the area of information and communication policy as they reflect its political priorities; calls on the GII to further improve cooperation with the competent committees; Ensuring value for money in the European institutions 3. Points out that enlargement obliges the institutions to critically examine their working methods and the allocation of resources, with a view to improving their value for money for the taxpayer; requests the institutions to make specific proposals in their 2004 estimates that could lead to an improved quality of spending and to an improved focus on core activities; invites the institutions also, given the pressure on the ceiling of heading 5, to limit their new requests as far as possible to enlargement-related needs; General framework 4.

Takes the view that the adoption of a budget for 25 Member States is necessary to reflect the historical importance of enlargement; considers that the difference between a budget for the 15 current Members from January to May and for 25 Members from May 2004 onwards is less obvious in administrative expenditure; notes, however, that specific arrangements may have to be envisaged to take the timing of enlargement into account; invites all institutions to present their 2004 estimates on the basis of 25 Member States and to clearly define all enlargement-related expenditure per item; 7. Invites all institutions to present their 2004 estimates in a more transparent manner, to improve the analytical part of the budget and to examine, in the spirit of the new Financial Regulation, how performance indicators can be established for the management of their budgets with a view to increasing the quality
