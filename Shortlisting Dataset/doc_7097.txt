WRITTEN QUESTION E-2606/10 by Franz Obermayr (NI) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Increase in crime in the European District of Brussels According to reports in the media (for example in the German Financial Times ), the situation in Brussels, the ‘capital of Europe’, is becoming increasingly desperate. There has been a huge increase in crime in recent years, particularly in the European District. Drug dealing, theft, robbery, damage to property (cars) and violent crimes are no longer a rarity in the area around the European institutions. Victims’ accounts are on the increase, with Members, assistants, officials, lobbyists and embassy staff reporting attacks in the vicinity of the EU institutions. President Jerzy Buzek contacted Freddy Thielemans, Mayor of Brussels, to ask for increased protection from police patrols. Thielemans refused, saying he could not take any police away from other districts just to protect the EU District. 1. Does the Commission have records showing the number of attacks on EU employees in recent years? 2. Does the Commission also intend to contact the Mayor of Brussels? 3. Is the Commission working on other ways of making the lives of EU employees in Brussels safer? 4. If so, what is it planning to do? (Introduce the EU’s own security provisions in the vicinity of the institutions?)
