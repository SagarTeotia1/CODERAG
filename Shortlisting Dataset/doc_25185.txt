competences as regards the external dimension of the CFP, it is the Commission that must be responsible for proper representation, effective negotiation, coordination, participation in scientific meetings and forums, and relations with RFOs generally, including fisheries monitoring; calls on the Commission, accordingly, when it adopts its communication on the external dimension of the CFP, to make a stronger commitment to the Community fleet fishing in non-Community waters, given that fisheries must not become an exception to the principle of enhancing the Community's presence at world level, whilst at the same time assessing and respecting the environmental and social implications of such a policy on external fisheries and third countries; 5. Calls for action to fill the existing gaps in human and material resources in the Commission's services and for the reorganisation of the DG Fisheries establishment plan; should this not be sufficient, calls on the Commission to allocate the necessary funding in the preliminary draft budget; 6. Calls on the Council and the Commission to seek participation in those RFOs in which the Community sector has a legitimate interest but from which the Community is nonetheless currently excluded, in order to promote the principles of responsible fishing and defend the Community's fishing interests; reminds the Council and the Commission that Parliament has already called on them to raise, in the appropriate forums, the question of readjusting the EU's voting weight in the RFOs in line with the number of participant countries; 7. Recognises that it is in the Community's interest to pursue an active policy to ensure greater compliance with international law developed by the United Nations in the interests of sustainable fishing, the main instruments here being the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the 'New York Agreement' of 4 August 1995 on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the agreements reached at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002; 8. Calls for the ratification of the New York Agreement to be accompanied by that of the interpretative notes for its correct implementation, as well as the FAO's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries; urges the Community to implement the action plans recently adopted by the FAO on sharks, seabirds, the organisation of fishing capacity and the eradication of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; urges those Member States which have not yet ratified the New York Agreement to do so forthwith; 9. Calls on the Council and the Community to engage in negotiations with ACP countries, countries with which the Community has signed agreements and countries which are members of RFOs alongside the Union, with a view to further developing trade relations which will ensure both access for their products to the EU market and the presence of the EU fleet in non-Community fishing grounds, on the basis of the principle of responsible fishing; 10. Calls also on the Council and Commission to focus, within the international dimension of the CFP, on the need to establish relations with non-member Mediterranean countries, allocating adequate human and financial resources to that end, in order
