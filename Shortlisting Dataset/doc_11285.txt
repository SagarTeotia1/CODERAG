the compulsory fitting of seat belt reminders for driver seats in all new vehicles with due exceptions for urban public transport, and the extension of such reminders to passenger seats; - Electronic Stability Control (ESC): points out that worldwide research is unanimous of the significant life saving potential of vehicle stability control systems such as ESC US research by the National Highway Safety Administration suggests that there could be a reduction of 30% in deaths in single car crashes if all cars were equipped with ESC. ; supports the rapid introduction of ESC systems - possibly by a voluntary agreement - as well as the development of an internationally harmonised validation test for vehicle stability systems; - Speed limitation systems: notes the possibilities of speed reduction technologies through information to the driver, user selectable speed limiters and Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA), which could reduce crashes by around 35% as a compulsory and intervening system Intelligent Transportation Systems and Road Safety, ETSC 1999. ; calls for speed alert systems in cars and eventually the introduction of ISA where seen appropriate by national authorities; favours common technical standards as well as action to make EU-wide speed limit data available for digital maps; - Alcolocks: notes that alcohol-related road accidents total about 10.000 every year; urges the Commission to stimulate the introduction of reliable alcolocks; sees merit in a step-by-step approach starting with rehabilitation measures for repeat offenders, voluntary measures and commercial transports; - eCall: recalls that eCall (emergency call) has the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatalities, the severity of injuries and stress in post-crash situations, by speeding up the response to emergencies; welcomes the Action Plan for equipping new cars with e-call by 2009, and calls for this to be extended, if deemed cost-effective, to passenger vehicles and to vehicles for the transport of dangerous goods; 40. Supports the introduction of a revised, comprehensive EuroNCAP by strengthening cooperation with the Commission through additional financial support and more active participation in the work of the programme; calls for EuroNCAP to incorporate other passive safety aspects, such as whiplash protection and the compatibility of vehicles in the event of car-on-car impact; notes, furthermore, that active safety systems (such as ESC) are still a largely untried possibility with great potential for the improvement of road safety and that the most promising solutions should be incorporated into the EuroNCAP procedure; 41. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
