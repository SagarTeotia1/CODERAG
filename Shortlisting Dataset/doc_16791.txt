Question for written answer E-001538/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (24 February 2011) Subject: UK libraries facing budget cuts The British Government plans to cut GBP 81 billion a year from public spending over four years. One of the sectors targeted by government spending cuts is public libraries. According to reports in the UK media, many library users across the country are protesting, especially in isolated parts of the country where libraries and reading centres are most valuable. What is the Commission’s response to this? Is there a way to support the British people’s right to borrow books and have community libraries?
