Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (21 March 2012) EULEX is assisting the parties in the preparation of the negotiation and implementation of the IBM agreement reached in the EU‑facilitated dialogue on 2 December 2011. EULEX will in this respect only support and promote the implementation of measures consistent with that agreement. The Mission will otherwise continue to enforce its Rule of Law mandate in close coordination with the Kosovo Force (KFOR) responsibilities for ensuring a safe and secure environment.
