2004/C 70 E/175 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2931/03 by Marco Cappato (NI) , Maurizio Turco (NI) , Emma Bonino (NI) , Marco Pannella (NI) , Benedetto Della Vedova (NI) , Gianfranco Dell'Alba (NI) and Olivier Dupuis (NI) to the Commission (6 October 2003) Subject: Appointment of General Ammar as Chairman of the National Organising Committee for the World Summit on the Information Society Between 1984 and 1987, during which time General Habib Ammar commanded the National Guard, torture became a common practice in the Tunisian gendarmerie. In 1986, General Habib Ammar set up the National Special Services Department (Abhath Wa Taftich), whose main base was the Auoina barracks, in which torture was systematically and constantly practised against hundreds of prisons, most of whom were opponents to the Bourguiba regime. Following General Ben Ali's coup d'état, General Habib Ammar was appointed Interior Minister in the Tunisian Government in November 1987. During his time at the head of the Interior Ministry, the Ministry's premises were transformed into detention and torture centres. With a view to preparing for the holding of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), the second stage of whose proceedings will be held in Tunisia from 16 to 18 November 2005, the Tunisian Government has set up a National Organising Committee for the WSIS and has appointed General Habib Ammar chairman of the committee. Furthermore, the persistent violations of the right to freedom of expression and opinion, both on-line and off-line, which are a daily feature of political life in Tunisia and the fact that journalists and Internet users are being arrested, tortured and sentenced to heavy custodial sentences. Would the Commission not agree that every possible means of political, diplomatic and economic pressure should be used to persuade the Tunisian Government to revoke the appointment of General Ammar as Chairman of the National Organising Committee for the WSIS? Would it agree that it should speak out and take steps with a view to securing the suspension of the decision to hold the second session of the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia in 2005 until such time as the Tunisian Government ensures that the full enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression is genuinely guaranteed by Tunisian law?
