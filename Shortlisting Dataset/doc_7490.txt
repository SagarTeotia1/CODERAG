Question for written answer E-006742/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ole Christensen (S&D) (13 July 2011) Subject: Installation of fire sprinklers in buildings intended as workplaces As the Commission is aware, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in January 2008 on the Community strategy 2007-12 on health and safety at work. In paragraph 53 of that resolution the Commission was asked to carry out research into the feasibility and benefits, both to health and safety at work and to society as a whole, of requiring all new buildings intended as workplaces to install fire sprinklers where safe to do so. Can the Commission inform the Parliament of the state of play regarding this research? Has it already been completed or is it still under way? In the latter case, when is it expected to be completed?
