Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (15 January 2004) All Member States and the Commission agree that noni products (Morinda citrifolia) are novel food within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients, OJ L 43, 14.2.1997 . , as they have been placed on the market only after the entry into force of the Regulation. Therefore, the marketing of noni products prior to a possible authorisation under the Regulation is considered as illegal in all Member States. In order to ensure that noni products are treated in the same manner throughout the Community, Member States have agreed to take the appropriate steps to end any ongoing marketing of noni products in their territory (see also the Commission's answer to Written Question E-0325/20 02 by Mrs Müller OJ C 160 E, 4.7.2002 . ). The scope of the authorisation granted by the Commission Decision 2003/426/EC Commission Decision 2003/426/EC of 5 June 2003 authorising the placing on the market of noni juice (juice of the fruit of Morinda citrifolia l.) as a novel food ingredient under Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the Parliament and of the Council, OJ L 144, 12.6.2003 . is limited to the juice of the fruits of Morinda citrifolia as an ingredient to pasteurised fruit juices and it does not cover other uses of the said product. Therefore, other parts of the plant and/or other uses of the juice are not authorised. In order to protect public health, Regulation (EC) No 258/97 establishes a Community procedure for a single pre-market safety assessment of novel foods and novel food ingredients. The Member States are in charge of enforcement and control. Consequently, it would be the national authorities, probably with the help of the competent food assessment bodies, who would have to determine whether a history of safe human consumption of a particular food is adequately demonstrated. The Regulation does not set out any criteria for defining history of safe consumption . However, in order to ensure a harmonised approach in the safety assessment of novel foods and novel food ingredients, Member States refer to the criteria and requirements laid down in the Commission Recommendation 618/97/EC Commission Recommendation of 29 July 1997 concerning the scientific aspects and the presentation of information necessary to support applications for the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients and the preparation of initial assessment reports under Regulation EC No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council, OJ L 253, 16.9.1997 . . The determination whether the product has or not a history of safe consumption is not applicable in the case of Morinda citrifolia, because Commission Decision 2003/426/EC implies that it is a novel food. For other foods and food ingredients, if appropriate and necessary, a Decision whether a food or food ingredient falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) 258/97 may be taken pursuant to Article 1.3 of the Regulation according to the
