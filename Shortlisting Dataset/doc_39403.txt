Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (23 December 2005) The Commission is doing its utmost to keep up with the rhythm of important correspondence pursued by the Honourable Member. Replies to his letters are on their way. The Commission is not aware of the article published in the ‘Expresso’ weekly, with which it has nothing to do whatsoever. The views expressed by its representative to the Parliament Delegation for relations with Iran obviously reflect the position of the Commission.
