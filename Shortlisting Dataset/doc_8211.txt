Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (13 December 2011) In its conclusions on ‘Innovative approaches for chronic diseases in public health and healthcare systems’ 3053rd Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council meeting Brussels, 7 December 2010. , the Council invited Member States and the Commission to ‘initiate a reflection process aiming to identify options to optimise the response to the challenges of chronic diseases’ and ‘to lead this reflection process in close dialogue with relevant stakeholders’ and the Commission to ‘support Member States and stakeholders in the reflection process and summarise its outcomes in a reflection paper by 2012’. Following the adoption of these conclusions, the Commission has begun a reflection process on chronic disease which includes an initial request for input from stakeholders through the EU Health Policy Forum. The Commission intends to carry out further work over the course of 2012 and summarise outcomes in a paper. Details on the process, including on actions to engage with additional stakeholders will be published in due course.
