Question for written answer E-011577/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (9 December 2011) Subject: Elections in East Timor (2012): challenges for the national police According to the Portuguese news agency Lusa, the UN Secretary-General, presenting a report in New York at a Security Council meeting on the subject of the UN mission to East Timor, said that the forthcoming presidential and legislative elections in that country will be a ‘test for the PNTL [National Police of East Timor]’, which is still having to deal with ‘logistic constraints’. Mr Ki-Moon specified that ‘it will be particularly important to ensure that the PNTL has the capacity to respond to potential security challenges during and beyond the election period, including in remote areas’, and that the PNTL's response capacity ‘will also mean requiring a suitable response to its logistic needs’. Can the Commission state: — whether it is aware of these statements by the UN Secretary-General; — whether it is aware of the logistic and operational constraints facing the PNTL; — whether it is willing to assist the PNTL in the organisation of its missions related to the presidential and legislative elections of 2012, and whether it has received any request from East Timor to that effect; — what budget and human materials and resources it can or could make available for this purpose; — whether it intends to align its action with that of the Member States most committed to assisting East Timor, and, if so, how?
