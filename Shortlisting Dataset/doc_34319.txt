WRITTEN QUESTION P-2392/08 by Marie-Noëlle Lienemann (PSE) to the Commission (21 April 2008) Subject: Redeployment of seven employees of STAF in France What measures does the European Commission intend to take in order to ban irregular offers of redeployment within an industrial group in the case of redundancies or job losses? It is unacceptable that when a company such as STAF (an Italian company located in France in the Pas-de-Calais region) cuts jobs, its only offer of redeployment for seven employees is a transfer to Brazil or Turkey, countries where the standard of living and social conditions can in no way be compared to those of France. Is it not possible for the European Union, which claims to be developing ‘flexicurity’, to impose conditions that redeployment offers must be comparable in terms of salary, living conditions and, as a matter of priority, are geographically close to the post occupied?
