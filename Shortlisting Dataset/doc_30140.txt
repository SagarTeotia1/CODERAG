WRITTEN QUESTION E-5492/08 by Péter Olajos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 October 2008) Subject: Problems with the operation of the registration system for CO 2 quotas Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and Council established a trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions within the Community (the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, or EU ETS). Unfortunately, however, realising the objectives of the EU ETS is extremely difficult owing to considerable problems with the operation of the IT system set up for the registration and trading of quotas. The Community Independent Transaction Log system and some country registers have not been working on a number of occasions recently. Companies involved in trading have reported instances of major financial losses as a result of problems and breakdowns of the system. The system operators have provided no information on the reasons for the problems. Users in Hungary have experienced serious irregularities with the system’s operation in recent weeks. In the light of the above I would like to ask the following: Is the Commission aware of the operational problems described here, and what measures is it taking or has it taken to prevent any future recurrence?
