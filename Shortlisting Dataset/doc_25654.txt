the Member States, or failing that, concrete improvements in the regulatory framework, a clearer separation of energy production from energy distribution through stronger independent regulatory control which considers the interests of Europe as a whole, an effort to address missing interconnections, stimulate investment and innovation, minimum binding guidelines set out for regulators, including a procedure for the appointment of regulators, independence, transparency and accountability, an ambitious R&D strategy on clean energy technologies, an increase of at least 50% in its annual spending on energy research over the next seven years, the development of an effective solidarity mechanism to deal with any energy supply crisis, a common foreign energy policy strategy so that it can increasingly speak with one voice to third countries, a doubling of the efforts to get global action to combat climate change, since the EU cannot tackle the problem alone, and full implementation of all current EU energy legislation; 59. Recognises that climate change is causing serious environmental problems requiring immediate EU and international action; believes that by 2050 the overwhelming proportion of EU energy needs must come from carbon-free sources or be produced using technologies which cut greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on energy saving, efficiency and renewable energies, and that there is therefore a need to set out a clear roadmap for attaining this objective; urges EU leaders to agree by the end of 2008 year on a binding 2020 CO2 target and an indicative 2050 CO2 target; 60. Acknowledges the significant role which renewable energy sources play in helping small- and medium-sized enterprises achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy; calls on the Commission and the Member States to take practical measures to improve the energy efficiency of small- and medium-sized enterprises; these should include, in particular, measures to raise awareness of the issues involved and to facilitate access to funding, for example from the Structural Funds, the EBRD and the EIB, so that firms can make investments with the aim of reducing energy consumption; 61. Calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that the EU becomes the most energy efficient economy in the world by 2020 and to set energy efficiency measures as a horizontal priority for all sectors in the EU; calls on the Commission to ensure timely implementation of EC directives in the field and urges the Council to adopt the proposals in the energy efficiency action plan and Member States to use best practice as a basis for their national energy efficiency action plans, to be submitted by June 2007; points out that if Member States were to fully implement existing EU legislation, half the EU target of a 20% energy saving by 2020 would already be met; calls on the President of the Commission to promote a global energy efficiency agreement; 62. Calls for the Spring European Council in March 2007 to ensure that Europe's future energy policy is backed up by an ambitious R&D strategy in the field of energy, including more adequate public funding and strong incentives for increased private R&D funding; encourages Member States to
