WRITTEN QUESTION E-1864/04 by Baroness Sarah Ludford (ALDE) to the Commission (25 August 2004) Subject: International access to telephone-based services Given that many European citizens work outside their home country, but still need to contact their bank/insurance company/ government department, etc., it is frustrating and parochial when such establishments/institutions make available only a ‘national rate’ number which, even if it is toll-free in the home country, is of no use to callers resident elsewhere in the EU. What initiatives is the Commission therefore taking to urge all EU public and private service providers to advertise an internationally-accessible telephone number on which citizens/customers may contact them?
