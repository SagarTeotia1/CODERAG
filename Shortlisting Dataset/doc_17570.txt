Question for written answer E-5088/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (7 July 2010) Subject: Benefits reaped by certain companies as a result of the economic crisis in Europe According to an article which appeared in the International Herald Tribune of 21 June, the economic crisis in Europe has not affected all businesses in the same way. Some countries and businesses have taken advantage of the situation, benefitting from the fall in exchange rates and extremely low interest rates. According to the article, the company Siemens has increased its 2011 profit forecasts from 6.5 million euro to 7.5 or even 9.3 million euro. In an interview, Peter Y. Solmssen, a member of the Siemens management board with responsibility for the company's US operations, said: ‘one can't ignore the sovereign debt problems, but it hasn't affected our business’. Again according to the article by Jack Ewing, Germany appears to be the big winner in the economic crisis, even if the Germans complained the loudest about the bail-out mechanism for Greece and other European Union Member States. Can the Commission say whether the information given in this article is accurate? If so, which other countries have benefitted from the crisis?
