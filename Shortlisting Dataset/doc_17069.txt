Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (7 July 2008) With regard to the question of the Honourable Member on whether EU money has been made available for training on seal culling the Commission would like to point out that neither the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance 2000‑06 nor the European Fisheries Fund 2007‑13, cover training for the culling of seals. The Commission is not aware of any Community funding provided for that purpose.
