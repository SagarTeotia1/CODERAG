Question for written answer E-3739/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oriol Junqueras Vies (Verts/ALE) (27 May 2010) Subject: The unlawful government in Honduras On 17, 18 and 19 May 2010, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union will host the EU‑Latin America Summit in Madrid. The current President of Honduras, Porfirio Lobo, will not be attending, as individual Latin American governments have expressed concern at the questionable democratic legitimacy of his mandate. Mr Lobo will, however, be a guest of the Spanish Government at the EU‑Central America Summit, to take place on 19 May. The level of legitimacy accorded to the current President of Honduras by the European Union and the international community is unacceptable. He took power after elections that were conducted without due process following a coup d’état. The European Union should not allow Mr Lobo to attend as the legitimate representative of the people of Honduras. It should instead be cooperating on an ongoing basis with the politicians active in the People’s National Front for Resistance to the Coup in Honduras, as well as other political organisations in the country. The EU should also be taking an active interest in the human rights situation in Honduras, especially the situation of people involved in movements calling for a legitimate government and seeking to establish who was responsible for the wave of violence, killings and disappearances that occurred during the protests that followed the coup. Does the Commission agree that Porfirio Lobo’s government in Honduras should be treated as legitimate? Does the Commission intend to take steps with a view to calling on the Honduran Government to uphold democratic rights and political freedoms in Honduras? Does the Commission have links with the political opposition in Honduras?
