WRITTEN QUESTION E-2032/10 by Kyriakos Mavronikolas (S&D) to the Commission (6 April 2010) Subject: Loss of income of refugee farmers in Cyprus Since July 1974, 37 % of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus has been illegally occupied by Turkish forces, as UN resolutions have repeatedly stated. Given that farmers have been prevented from cultivating their arable land located in the occupied part of the island, this land has thus lain fallow (i.e. been set aside) for the last 35 years and farmers have lost enormous amounts of income. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. If farmers were not forcibly deprived of the right to use their land, would they receive the benefits provided for under the common agricultural policy? 2. If they were eligible for these benefits, how would it compensate them for not having received these benefits? 3. How can the refugee farmers be compensated within the framework of subsided set-aside?
