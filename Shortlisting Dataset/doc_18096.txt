WRITTEN QUESTION E-2630/06 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 June 2006) Subject: Criteria for the identification and labelling of Sardina pilchardus The Sardina pilchardus used in canning is one of the most important products for the fishing and fish-canning industry in Galicia, Spain, as well as for other Member States that are producer countries for this species. These countries have recently protested at the fraudulent practices involving canned sardines on the market, where this denomination is used for other similar preparations which should be labelled with a different denomination, i.e. ‘ sardine-type’ under international rules. 1. Is the Commission aware of this fraud, which is clearly having a serious impact on the industry as well as confusing consumers by not differentiating between species? 2. Does the Commission agree that it is necessary to step up inspections in order to avoid this situation? 3. Will the Commission widen its competences as regards the application of Community rules so that it can act in the event of irregularities in the identification and labelling of sardines, and so that it is not only the states involved that can intervene in such cases?
