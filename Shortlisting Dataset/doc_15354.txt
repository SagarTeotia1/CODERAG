Question for written answer E-3551/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Dan Jørgensen (S&D) (25 May 2010) Subject: The Tøndermarsken Natura 2000 reserve The Danish Forest and Nature Agency has noted a significant decline in birdlife in the Tøndermarsken area in Denmark. Since the area is designated as a Natura 2000 reserve, it is the responsibility of the Danish authorites to ensure that good conditions are provided for birdlife in Tøndermarsken. The Danish Ornithological Association (the Danish branch of BirdLife International) complained to the Commission on 21 June 2002 and on 18 May 2009 about Denmark’s inadequate protection and management of birdlife in the Tøndermarsken Natura 2000 reserve. What reception did these complaints receive at the Commission, and did they lead to any response?
