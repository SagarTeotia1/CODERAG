WRITTEN QUESTION P-3174/09 by Lena Ek (ALDE) to the Commission (27 April 2009) Subject: Commission's plans to conserve natural pastureland Over the last few decades, EU support has facilitated the — very postive — development of traditional pastureland in countries such as Sweden. Natural pastureland is the most economical method of producing fodder. There is no need to plough or sow the land. It also makes a significant contribution towards one of the EU's most important environmental objectives, biological diversity. From a climate point of view, such land provides important carbon sinks and a basis for the most environment-friendly form of meat production. However, a question mark now hangs over the support for pastureland which derives from the single farm payment. New rules are in the pipeline whereby grassland with more than the occasional tree may not be classified as agricultural land. Such land must instead be classified as woodland and is thereby excluded from the common agricultural policy. Under the new rules, up to one sixth of Swedish pastureland would be excluded from the common agricultural policy, which would be damaging for the climate, farmers and the environment. Many of the plants typical of the thousand year-old landscape would be directly under threat. Is it possible to retain the current rules governing the single farm payment scheme so that natural pastureland in countries such as Sweden can continue to receive support? What measures does the Commission intend to take to conserve natural pastureland? In order to show how deeply rooted this type of landscape is in the soul of the Swedish people, I attach a copy of the children's book ‘Sunnanäng’ (South Wind Meadow) by Astrid Lindgren. The world famous author set many of her stories precisely in and around Swedish pastureland.
