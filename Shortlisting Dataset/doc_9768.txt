Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (22 August 2006) The Commission is concerned about the rejection by the Latvian Parliament of the amendment to the Labour Code that would have banned discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The Latvian President, Mrs Vike-Freiberga, also criticised this version of the law and returned it to the Parliament for further review. The Commission is also aware that gay pride in Riga has recently been banned on public order grounds. The Commission underlines that all Member States have to transpose all the provisions of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation OJ L 303, 2.12.2000 . . Member States that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 were obliged to transpose the directive by that time. The Commission monitors the implementation of Directive 2000/78/EC in all Member States and takes the appropriate measures provided under Article 226 of the EC Treaty to ensure that all the provisions of the directive are correctly transposed into national law. The Commission points out that the material scope of Directive 2000/78/EC covers employment and occupation. It does not cover the more general problem of homophobia. The Commission therefore cannot intervene in such cases. Complaints with regard to possible violations of the European Convention of Human Rights have to be addressed to the European Court of Human Rights following exhaustion of domestic remedies.
