Question for written answer E-004629/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Frieda Brepoels (Verts/ALE) (16 May 2011) Subject: Attendance of dignitaries at the beatification of Pope John Paul II Last weekend the former Pope John Paul II was beatified by his successor Pope Benedict XVI. The ceremony was attended by various heads of state and other dignitaries. One of these was Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. I am informed that Mugabe entered Italy via Rome airport. Given the ban on entry to the EU which is in force against Mugabe, can the Commission explain how he was able to enter the EU and take part in the ceremony? Did the Commission hold consultations with Italy on this matter? If not, will the Commission raise the subject with Italy? If so, what views did the Commission express to Italy? What checks do the Member States and the European institutions carry out on compliance with bans on entry to the EU? What are the consequences for Member States of failure to uphold entry bans? What does the Commission propose to do to prevent such incidents in future?
