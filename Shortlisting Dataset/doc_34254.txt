WRITTEN QUESTION E-3642/06 by Angelika Niebler (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 August 2006) Subject: Compulsory examinations in connection with the intra-Community transport of fallow deer The intra-Community transport of fallow deer is governed by provisions including those laid down in Directive 92/65/EEC OJ L 268, 14.9.1992, p. 54 . . Pursuant to that directive, prior to their dispatch it must be demonstrated that the animals are brucellosis- and tuberculosis-free. This can be done in one of two ways: either the animals are shown to come from an officially brucellosis- and tuberculosis-free herd, or they must be individually examined 30 days prior to dispatch. The process of demonstrating that an entire herd is brucellosis- and tuberculosis-free seems to be carried out in very different ways in the Member States. In some cases annual tests are carried out, and in others only spot checks, in which connection the competent authorities are allowed some leeway in deciding how to perform this task. In the case of farmed fallow deer, how in practice do the Member States meet the requirement to demonstrate that an entire herd or an individual animal is brucellosis- and tuberculosis-free within the meaning of Directive 92/65/EEC? In that connection, are there cases in which a subsequent meat inspection is regarded as sufficient? In which Member States are farmed fallow deer generally recognised as being brucellosis- and tuberculosis-free, like sheep and cattle, for example? Do the European rules offer some leeway when it comes to determining whether a herd of fallow deer is brucellosis- and tuberculosis-free?
