Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (19 October 2010) For Rural Development Programmes in the 2007‑13 period, Article 17 of Council Regulation (EC) 1698/2005 Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), OJ L 277, 21.10.2005. provides that the total EU contribution to a given Rural Development Programme shall cover at least 10 % for each of axes 1 and 3, at least 25 % for axis 2, and at least 5 % for axis 4 (Leader). Transfers of programming of funds between axes have to respect these ratios. So, even if it transpires that the programme implementation will not reach the above ratios for a given axis, the transfers of programming of funds cannot go below such a ratio. Appropriations not used by the end of the programme would be lost to the Member State concerned. However, this would not lead to a reduction in the appropriations available to the other axes. In Ireland, Leader is entirely targeted at implementing axis 3 measures. This amount, together with the amount allocated in that axis to rural broadband, constitutes approximately 10 % of the programme. So if expenditure on Leader does not reach the amount planned, the shortfall in the EU contribution will be lost to Ireland. But, by way of an amendment of the programme, the programming could be modified so other expenditure is included within axis 3. In either case, this would not affect REPS or AEOS, which are schemes in axis 2, or the single farm payment.
