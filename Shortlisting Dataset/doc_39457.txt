Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (8 February 2012) Insulin used for treatment of diabetes mellitus carries the risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), which may lead to an incapacitation of the pilot inflight. Therefore, according to international and regional standards ICAO Annex A and JAR-FCL 3. , insulin dependant diabetes mellitus leads to an unfit assessment for private and commercial pilots. However, the UK allows holders of UK national private pilot licence (NPPL) who suffer from insulin dependant diabetes to hold a medical certificate but restrict the licence of these pilots to their national territory. Regulation 1178/2011 OJ L 311, 25.11.2011, p. 1-193. does not contain detailed mandatory rules with regard to medical conditions for the European leisure pilot licence (LAPL). Those details are contained in acceptable means of compliance (AMC) adopted by EASA European Aviation Safety Agency. . Under those AMC, the use of insulin will be possible, under stringent control, for those pilots who hold a LAPL and suffer from one specific type of diabetes that is normally treated with different medication. This does not include pilots with insulin dependant diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is higher. A rulemaking task to review the medical provisions of Regulation 1178/2011 has been initiated by EASA and includes the review and the assessment of any type of diabetes mellitus treated with insulin. Consultations will take place with specialists in the field, relevant studies will be reviewed, and experience made in the UK, US and Canada will be taken into account to come to a conclusion that can be supported by all and which carries no air safety risk. The medical provisions for the European leisure pilot licence (LAPL) will become applicable from 8 April 2012 but Member States are allowed to defer the implementation of LAPL provisions until 8 April 2015 and to continue with their national regulations until that moment.
