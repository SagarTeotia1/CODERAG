Question for written answer E-004200/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (3 May 2011) Subject: Burial of an important ancient monument in the Athens Agora During the rebuilding of Line 1 of the Athens Metro, archaeological finds came to light which were identified as belonging to the Altar of the Twelve Gods http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_2_12/02/2011_432380 . This monument was the symbolic centre of the ancient city and the starting point for measuring all distances http://project.athens-agora.gr/index.php?view=ktirio&pid=3&lang_id=gr . A representative of the Greek Ministry of Culture has publicly appealed for the preservation of the monument http://www.skai.gr/news/culture/article/165413/tha-meinei-anepafos-o-vomos-ton-12-theon-/ , and citizens have submitted a petition for emergency measures to provide legal protection which were due to be discussed on 15 April. However, in the early hours of 13 April , shortly before the application was due to be discussed at Athens Court of the First Instance, the contractor's crews began operations to bury the finds http://www.bomos.gr/ , ignoring all the alternative proposals that had been put forward to rebuild the line while at the same time highlighting the monument. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Is the reconstruction of Line 1 of the Metro in the section that includes the passage through the ancient Agora being co-funded with EU funds? 2. Are European regulations and conventions for the protection of the cultural heritage being respected by this project? 3. Would the additional costs needed to combine the reconstruction of the line and highlighting the monument be eligible for EU co-funding?
