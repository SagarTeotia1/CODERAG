is also a very effective and inexpensive way of improving energy security; 4. Calls on the Commission and Member States to make the 20% energy saving target by 2020 legally binding on Member States and to propose and implement consistent measures to secure its achievement; 5. Calls on the European Union and the Member States to adopt as objectives a 35% improvement in energy efficiency and a 60% share of renewable energy by 2050; 6. Calls on the Commission to support all planned investments in new import energy infrastructure and renewable energy technologies to face the decreasing level of oil and gas prices that has a negative effect on planned investments; European energy policy 7. Calls on Member States, in the light of the growing risks which the European Union is running in terms of energy security, to speak with a single voice; notes that their current practices are anything but geared to this aspiration; considers it imperative, in the interests of security of supply, solidarity and of the effectiveness of negotiations with a view to determining the international regulatory framework, for the Commission to propose to Parliament and the Council the drawing up of a European energy policy which has due regard for the respective competences of the European Union and of the Member States: international relations, energy efficiency, combating climate change, further development of the internal market, negotiation of international treaties, forward studies and dialogue with producers and transit countries, energy research and diversification of energy supplies; 8. Calls on the Commission to contribute to the creation of a single European voice towards third country producers through the development of mutually beneficial interdependency and to support the strengthening of the trading power of EU undertakings as against that of the state-owned undertakings of third countries; 9. Considers that energy solidarity must become a major European concern at European, regional and bilateral level and that damaging energy supply in a Member State afflicts the European Union as a whole; 10. Stresses the importance of local initiatives to combat climate change; endorses measures to promote energy efficiency and renewable energies, such as the financing programmes which fall under the cohesion policy or green taxation, or the contribution by the "Covenant of Mayors", and supports in this regard the idea of a "Covenant of Islands" towards the dissemination of best practices and the development of highly efficient and renewable energy communities and cities; 11. Believes that an appropriate European energy policy must be founded on a balanced energy mix based on the use of non-carbon energy and the lowest emitting fossil fuels and on new technologies which drastically reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from solid fossil fuels; 12. Believes that Member States should develop national strategies to tackle the issue of energy poverty within their territory; 13. Considers that the division of tasks between undertakings and political decision-makers, whereby undertakings take responsibility for security of supply, is of proven value and should therefore in principle be preserved; calls on political decision-makers, in view of the increasingly difficult global environment, in future to adopt
