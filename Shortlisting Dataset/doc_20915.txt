Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (7 October 2011) The Culture Programme provides significant added value to Europe's cultural sector. Each year the programme involves some 1 500 cultural organisations and an estimated 20 000 cultural practitioners. Furthermore, it enables some 500 literary works to be translated each year. Through the project activities the programme reaches millions of people directly and indirectly. The interim evaluation of the programme carried out for the Commission by ECORYS and published in 2010 found that the Culture Programme plays a unique and important role in protecting and promoting Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity as stipulated in Article 3(3) of the Treaty on the European Union. The interim evaluation is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/evalreports/culture/2010/progreport_en.pdf In terms of sustainability, many cooperation projects have generated follow-on opportunities and activities, building solid foundations for future activity, fostering a more European and international outlook among individuals, and forming partnerships that are strong and valuable enough to endure. The Commission has sought during the past years to better exploit and disseminate information on the result of granted activities. To this end the Commission has organised annual conferences since 2008 to showcase the content of projects. These have been accompanied by project exhibitions and brochures, which are also available online (under the heading ‘Culture in Motion’): http://ec.europa.eu/culture/key-documents/publications_en.htm
