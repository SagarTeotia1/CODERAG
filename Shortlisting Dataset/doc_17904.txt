Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (21 January 2009) Regarding oral exposure by hexavalent chromium, a long-term carcinogenic study reported in the Guidelines for Drinking Quality WHO Guidelines for drinking water quality, Geneva, 2004. of the World Health Organisation (WHO) did not show evidence for carcinogenicity. However, the available data on hexavalent chromium is limited. The current Drinking Water Directive Council Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption, OJ L 330, 5.12.1998. parameter value for chromium (50 µg/l) is based upon the WHO Guidelines of 1992. The WHO 2004 Guidelines did not introduce changes in relation to chromium and the toxicological data available so far does not support the introduction of a new parameter value for chromium. The Commission is currently considering a revision of the directive including, where appropriate, amendments to the parameter values. As regards the priority substances list under the Water Framework Directive Directive 2000/60/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000. (WFD), the Commission is currently reviewing the priority substances list (Annex X of the WFD) to identify new substances, if appropriate, and set environmental quality standards for water, sediment and biota, for the substances identified. The work is currently in progress and therefore, at this stage, the Commission cannot make a statement on whether chromium will be identified as a priority substance.
