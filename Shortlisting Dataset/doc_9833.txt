WRITTEN QUESTION E-4187/05 by Anja Weisgerber (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 November 2005) Subject: Structural aid in the period 2007-2013: Possibility of co-financing conversion measures from EU structural funds With the fall of the Iron Curtain, the military situation in the world changed fundamentally, in particular in Continental Europe. Against this background of change, many measures have been taken to reduce the number of US troops in Europe. In addition, many European countries have also decided to reduce their own armed forces. As a result of these developments, the problem has arisen of converting military areas to civilian areas. This problem applies to many areas throughout the EU, in particular to structurally weak areas. Against the background of the new scheme for EU structural aid, which is succeeding specifically because of the abolition of the strict division into objective regions, I should be grateful for answers to the following questions: 1. Are measures to convert military areas into civilian areas in principle eligible for aid under the EU's structural policy? 2. What possibilities does the Commission recognise, and what measures does it envisage taking in order to address this pan-European phenomenon — which, on the one hand, could be extremely dangerous but, on the other, could provide great opportunities for structurally weak regions — in such a way that the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are not jeopardised?
