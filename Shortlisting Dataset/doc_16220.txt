Question for written answer P-8721/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Stavrakakis (S&D) (21 October 2010) Subject: Rural development policy and synergies with the Structural Funds In the previous programming period (2000‑06), when the EAFRD was part of cohesion policy, there was greater potential for coordination between rural development policy and the other Structural Funds. One of the main arguments for the separation in 2007 was simplification (one single fund — EAFRD — for all rural development programmes). Rural development policy can play a pivotal role in addressing cohesion objectives, such as balanced regional development, by enabling rural areas to exploit their potential (place-specific assets and capabilities). Could the Commission state whether: — the separation of the EAFRD from the field of cohesion policy has produced the expected results in terms of simplification? If so, has this simplification resulted in an increase in Member State expenditure in the wider rural economy (social and human capital)? — the separation of the EAFRD programmes from the ERDF, ESF and Cohesion Fund has resulted in a more effective territorial approach (coordination between the separate policy spheres) to rural development, or, in other words, if national and regional rural development programmes are more territorial than sectoral by comparison with the previous programming period?
