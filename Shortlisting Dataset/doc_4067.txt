Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (22 August 2011) According to the Treaty, the Commission plays no role in the selection, hearing and appointment of the members of the European Central Bank (ECB) executive board and its president. However, the Commission is of the view that Mr Draghi is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters as required by the Treaty. Concerning transactions in derivatives between the Greek debt agency and Goldman Sachs, the Honourable Member is referred to a report by Eurostat on the methodological visits to Greece, which is available at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/government_finance_statistics/documents/ Greece%20-%202010 %20methodological%20visits%20report.pdf The Commission understands that the off-market cross-currency swaps between Greek debt agency and Goldman Sachs, which, for some time, were incorrectly recorded in the Greek public deficit and debt, were initiated in 2001 before Mr Draghi worked with Goldman Sachs. At the Public Hearing with the Parliament Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) on 15 June 2011 Mr Draghi stated that there was no direct link between those transactions and their recording and his professional tasks.
