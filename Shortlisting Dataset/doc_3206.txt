Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (8 November 2005) As in the implementing year 2005, the budget committed for the annual distribution plan 2006 for the most deprived persons, as laid down in the preliminary draft budget (PDB), was EUR 216 million. Of this overall budget, a certain amount of money has to be put aside to cover transfer costs provided for in the Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 of 29 October 1992 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community, OJ L 313, 30.10.1992 . , Article 2, paragraph 3(2). In 2005, this amount was some EUR 4.5 million, leaving about EUR 211.5 million available for distribution. For the draft plan 2006, the necessary amount to cover transfers was estimated at EUR 4 million, hence the perceived ‘reduction’ to EUR 212 million. As in the previous years, this remaining amount was distributed according to poverty figures provided by Eurostat. A change in statistical methodology was conducted during 2004, which, together with the participation of several new Member States, had a considerable impact on the financial ceilings allocated to several Member States. To counterbalance the enlargement effect and the statistical impact, the Commission endeavours to increase the overall budget for the annual plan 2006 and to settle a revised draft plan accordingly.
