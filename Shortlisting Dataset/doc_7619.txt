WRITTEN QUESTION E-1587/05 by Charles Tannock (PPE‑DE) to the Council (28 April 2005) Subject: Fifth anniversary of the killings of innocent school children in the Gambia In April 2000, security forces in the Gambia allegedly killed 11 school children (including a 10 year old boy) and one Red Cross Volunteer. The coroner's report confirmed that 10 of the 11 people were killed by gun shot wounds. An investigation and report of the government's own Commission of Enquiry and the Attorney General and Secretary of State for Justice recommended that a number of named security and government officers be prosecuted for the unlawful killings. However, the Gambian Government chose to grant impunity against prosecution to the individuals named as responsible for the unlawful killings. This is further evidence of the systematic human rights abuses by the government of President Yahya Jammeh which is going largely unnoticed with allegations of torture and murder of innocent citizens — including in recent months the murder of a leading journalist and defence lawyer. Would the Council now consider imposing a travel ban for entry into the European Union on senior officials of the Gambian Government who appear to actively condone the killings of innocent Gambians? Failing that what other measures can be taken under the Cotonou Agreement Human Rights Clauses as the Gambia is a full signatory as an ACP country?
