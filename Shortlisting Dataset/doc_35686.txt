WRITTEN QUESTION E-1327/09 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (2 March 2009) Subject: Protecting cork industry producers, manufacturers, and workers in Portugal In the Santa Maria da Feira area there have been repeated cases in which workers at cork industry SMEs have not been paid on time or have been dismissed. Some small and medium-sized entrepreneurs are criticising the Amorim Group’s policy of controlling sales and the unfair competition in which it is engaging in an attempt to drive every rival Portuguese manufacturer off the national and international market. Now, however, the Amorim Group has caused a scandal by announcing a mass redundancy involving 193 workers. Given that Portugal is the world’s largest producer of real cork, it is, moreover, difficult to understand why the Portuguese farmers who own the cork oak groves should be having problems in buying this raw material. Another thing that cannot be accepted is the import of a Chinese substitute product which is called ‘cork’ but in reality is not. 1. Is the Commission aware of these situations? 2. What steps are being taken to defend Portuguese cork producers and manufacturers and prevent practices constituting unfair competition? 3. What steps are being taken to support cork industry SMEs and safeguard jobs with rights for all workers?
