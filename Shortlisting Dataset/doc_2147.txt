Reply (9 March 2006) The answers to the Honourable Member's questions are as follows. 1. The UK correction was confirmed in the context of the changes to the Own Resources Decision agreed as part of the overall political agreement on the Financial Framework for 2000–06 reached at the Berlin European Council in March 1999. The modified Own Resources Decision was adopted on 29 September 2000 and entered into force on 1 March 2002. 2. The amounts paid by the individual Member States to finance the UK correction are calculated in accordance with the arrangements set out in the decision, in particular its Article 5. Differences in amounts result essentially from different levels of GNI and the special arrangements agreed for Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. 3. and 4. The issue of the UK correction forms a part of the negotiations on the future financial framework (2007–13). An agreement concerning this correction was reached at the European Council of 15, 16 and 17 December 2005 and it will form part of a new Commission proposal to modify the Council decision on the system of the European Communities' own resources.
