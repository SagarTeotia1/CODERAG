incentive measures: ‘2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, when the Council adopts Community incentive measures, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States, to support action taken by the Member States in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in paragraph 1, it shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251’. It is precisely Article 13(2) that serves as the legal basis for this proposal for a decision. , stipulates that: 1. Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty and within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. On the basis of this Article, the EU has equipped itself with an original legal framework for combating discrimination, which has two directives as its cornerstones Namely Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (published in OJ L 180 of 19 July 2000) and Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (published in OJ L 303 of 2 December 2000). . The first of these directives, which relates to ‘racial equality’, prohibits direct and indirect discrimination in the fields of employment, training, education, social security, health care, housing and access to goods and services. The second of these directives essentially relates to the field of employment and concerns direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of religion or beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation. It contains important clauses on the provision of reasonable accommodation for disabled persons to promote their access to employment and training. These two directives are flanked by a multi-annual Community action programme to combat discrimination, which was adopted in November 2000 by decision of the Council Council Decision 2000/750/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a Community action programme to combat discrimination (2001-2006), published in OJ L 303 of 2.12.2000. and relates to the period 2001-2006. From 2007, this multi-annual programme will be replaced by the PROGRESS programme. One section of this programme is devoted to combating discrimination and promoting diversity, while another is aimed more specifically at gender equality COM(2004) 488 final, 14.7.2004. . With a view both to taking stock of the progress made in combating discrimination and to garner opinions on the ways in which the EU could strengthen its action in this field, the Commission launched a vast consultation process in May 2004 in the form of a Green Paper entitled ‘Equality and non-discrimination in an enlarged European Union’ COM(2004) 379 final, 28.05.2004 . The idea of making 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All was born out of the evaluation of the results achieved through publication of that Green Paper. 2.
