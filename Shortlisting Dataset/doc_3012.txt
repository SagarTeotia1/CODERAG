EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Trade in bananas Bananas are the world’s fourth most important crop, after rice, wheat and maize, and make a major contribution to food security. However, in most banana producing countries, production is exclusively for the domestic and occasionally regional markets, with only 20% of global production being traded internationally. Only a limited number of banana producing countries are involved in the international trade in bananas. Control of the banana trade is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of companies, with just five major multinationals controlling more than 80% of all internationally traded bananas. In recent years, however, the power of the banana multinationals has been eclipsed by the power of the supermarkets in some key EU markets, notably the UK. In 2008, EU consumers bought more than 5.4 million tonnes of bananas. The EU imported almost 90% of the bananas it consumed
