Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (16 July 2008) The Commission fully shares the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 16 June 2008, as follows: ‘The Council took note of the parliamentary elections in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 1 June 2008. It condemned the violent incidents and regretted other serious short-comings, as identified by the OSCE/ODIHR. The Council noted the measures taken by the authorities following 1 June including the organisation of re-runs on 15 June in all places where serious irregularities occurred. It called upon the authorities to investigate all reported incidents and take appropriate action in line with the recommendations from the OSCE/ODIHR. In this context, it welcomed the commitment of the authorities to address these issues without delay. The Council expects the new Parliament and Government to be established soon and to achieve sustainable progress in reforms. It called on all political parties to promote and participate in a constructive and inclusive dialogue and to implement the priorities identified in the Accession Partnership’. A Commission recommendation on the start of accession negotiations will depend on the results achieved by the country in meeting the key priorities of the Accession Partnership and in fulfilling the Copenhagen political criteria, of which free and fair elections are an essential part. The decision to start accession negotiations is to be taken by the Council of the European Union on the basis of unanimity of all Member States.
