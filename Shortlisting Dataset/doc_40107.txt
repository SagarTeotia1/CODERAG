WRITTEN QUESTION E-3211/08 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (6 June 2008) Subject: Continuously rising oil prices Oil prices are daily increasing by leaps and bounds to successively record highs, having risen by 20 % over the last three weeks to a level of USD 135 per barrel of crude. Pessimistic forecasts of the price attaining USD 200 per barrel are now clearly in danger of being realised. Can the Commission provide a comparative table of the pre-tax price of crude oil and petrol (euro-super 95) in the Member States from the beginning of 2008 to date (a) at the pump and (b) ex-refinery?
