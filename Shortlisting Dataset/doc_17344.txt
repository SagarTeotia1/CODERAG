WRITTEN QUESTION E-6419/09 by Mario Borghezio (EFD) to the Commission (4 January 2010) Subject: EU should allow exclusive use of local or dialect designations for food products The strict application of Regulation (EC) No 2065/2001 OJ L 278, 23.10.2001, p. 6. on informing consumers about fishery and aquaculture products, with regard specifically to the use of local dialects in product designations is causing inconvenience to consumers and serious problems for retailers in many towns in Italy and possibly in other EU countries. Such consumers point out, in particular, that traditional fishery designations are a means of ensuring that as many people as possible can clearly identify the particular species, given that products are frequently known solely by their local name. Is the Commission prepared to accept this argument put forward by producers and consumers and to allow the use — possibly, the exclusive use — of local or dialect designations on the labelling for such food products?
