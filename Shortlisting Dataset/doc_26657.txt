Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (27 September 2005) In 2003, the Commission published a Green Paper COM(2003)270. launching a broad public consultation on how best to promote the provision of high-quality services of general interest in the European Union. One of the key questions raised by the Green Paper concerned the need for a framework directive on services of general interest. In a White Paper of May 2004 COM(2004)374. , the Commission concluded that on the basis of the public consultation it remained doubtful whether a framework directive would be the most appropriate way forward at this stage. The White Paper stated that in the consultation, the added value of a horizontal framework as compared to the sector-specific approach followed so far had not been demonstrated. The Commission, therefore, considered it appropriate not to proceed to submitting a proposal. However, as announced in the White Paper, the Commission will review the situation of services of general interest in the European Union and the need for any horizontal measures in 2005. It intends to submit a report on its findings to Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions before the end of 2005.
