Question for written answer E-5513/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Thomas Ulmer (PPE) (14 July 2010) Subject: Medicinal Products Directive — Article 10 Some key aspects of the Medicinal Products Directive — 2001/83/EC OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67 . — have not been reviewed since the directive was last updated 10 years ago. Since then various of its articles have been open to interpretation by Member States and, indeed, some remain the subject of ongoing legal disputes. Based on those challenges there is clearly, for example, disagreement as to how aspects of Article 10 should be interpreted, with disagreement — for example — about the exact meaning of a ‘full data package’ and some evidence that interested parties are ‘cherry-picking’ amongst the various legal bases, arbitrarily. Does the Commission, therefore, have any plans to review either the directive or the comitology arrangements that run alongside it, so that the law is clearer and so that dispute resolution may become speedier? In particular, has the Commission considered how well Articles 10(1) and 10(3) operate in Member States and how effective the dispute resolution systems are of Articles 29, 30, 31 and 36? If the Commission is considering reviewing the working of the directive, in what timeframe will this take place?
