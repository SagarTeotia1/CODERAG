Question for written answer E-4138/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Alfredo Antoniozzi (PPE) (11 June 2010) Subject: New directive on the energy efficiency of public buildings — financial support instruments Under the new directive on the energy efficiency of public buildings, Member States are required to adopt national plans for financing the works involved, so as to implement the directive correctly. As Parliament pointed out at the legislative stage when the proposed directive was adopted, works are desirable not only on new buildings but also on the existing building stock (such as social housing), and in both cases national funding will not be sufficient to achieve the directive’s aims, since it requires funds that are too large for local, regional or national budgets. Can the Commission say what instruments it will be proposing (perhaps in conjunction with the EIB) to provide practical help for those local authorities and regions seeking to adopt local and regional plans to implement the directive? The current EIB Jessica and Elena initiatives are not sufficient and do not have the necessary funding. Moreover Jessica intervenes only in the case of financial engineering actions applied to management of the regional structural funds, which means that the structural funds must be already involved. To enable Member States to fully implement the directive and fulfil its objectives, does the Commission not agree that it should provide special financial instruments, perhaps in conjunction with the EIB? Can the Commission also evaluate the exclusion of such major works for the energy renovation of public buildings (the development of sustainable energy) from the stringent financial and accounting limits that local authorities have to comply with under the Stability Pact?
