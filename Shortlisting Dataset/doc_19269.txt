Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (28 February 2008) The Commission wishes to inform the Honourable Member that, together with its international partners, it continues to follow with great concern the situation of the prisoners of conscience still detained in Ethiopia. In the answer to the Honourable Member's previous Written Question P‑0790/07 it is stated that ‘Regarding the Honourable Member's wish to receive the EU observer’s Report of the political prisoners' trial, this Report was produced in the framework of a contract with the then EU Presidency (Finland) and delivered to the Finnish Ambassador in Addis Ababa at the end of the mission. The report was unofficially submitted to the Ministry of Justice, and shared in paper version with the EU Heads of Mission in Addis Ababa. It cannot be made public until the completion of the trial’. The Commission wishes to confirm that the reports of the two EU observers to the trial were prepared under the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council and it is not up to the Commission, but to the Presidency of the Council to decide whether to share them or not. Therefore this request should be addressed by the Honourable Member to the Presidency of the Council.
