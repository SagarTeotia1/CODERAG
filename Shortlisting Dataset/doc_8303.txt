WRITTEN QUESTION E-4124/05 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 November 2005) Subject: Workplace accidents and occupational diseases The serious incidence of workplace accidents, throughout the EU Member States, and of incapacity arising from occupational diseases is such that the issue needs to be made a major priority. Close attention must be paid to the implementation of the existing directives on workplace health and safety, the causes of work-related accidents and illnesses, and the improvement of prevention with a view to reducing workplace accidents and occupational disease. Can the Commission state: 1. what measures are proposed to ensure better monitoring in the Member States with a view to combating the causes of workplace accidents and occupational diseases and improving prevention; 2. what actions are planned to ensure the provision of benefit and other forms of support to those affected by workplace accidents and occupational diseases in order to guarantee their right to a decent life?
