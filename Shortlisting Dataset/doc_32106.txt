2004/C 84 E/007 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0844/03 by Herbert Bösch (PSE) to the Commission (18 March 2003) Subject: Contracts with management consultants Management consultants such as Andersen Consulting or Ernst & Young have hit the headlines recently for allegedly inadequate advisory services. Andersen came in for criticism over the Enron scandal and Ernst & Young is now faced with a demand for CHF 3 billion following more serious allegations of unsatisfactory work for the Cantonal Bank of Geneva. These incidents give rise to the following questions: — How many contracts were concluded in 2002 between the Commission and management consultants and what is their total value? — Has the Commission ever become aware of consultancy work being carried out unsatisfactorily? What criteria does the Commission apply when assessing advisory services? — Has a consultancy contract ever proved damaging to the Commission? — If so, to what extent and was compensation demanded? If not, why not? — Why are management consultants and not Commission officials called on to carry out certain tasks?
