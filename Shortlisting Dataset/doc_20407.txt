9999/C Q999 E/046 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1463/04 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (30 April 2004) Subject: Funding for the Municipality of Pisa under the Culture 2000 programme In answer to my earlier question E-3799/03 OJ C asking whether the Municipality of Pisa had submitted projects under the Culture 2000 programme in 2003, the Commission said that the call for proposals for projects taking place in 2004 under the Culture 2000 programme closed on 31 October 2003 (for annual projects) and 15 November 2003 (for multiannual projects) and that the projects submitted were being examined. Can the Commission now say whether the Municipality of Pisa has submitted a proposal under the Culture 2000 programme and whether its project has been selected?
