Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (4 June 2009) According to Article 2(b) of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 3821/85 and (EC) No 2135/98 and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85, OJ L 102, 11.4.2006, p 1‑13. , the regulation and Directive 2002/15/EC Directive 2002/15/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities, OJ L 80, 23.3.2002, p 35‑39. apply to the carriage by road ‘of passengers by vehicles which are constructed or permanently adapted for carrying more than nine persons including the driver, and are intended for that purpose’. Therefore, taxi drivers are excluded from the scope of these two EC legislations. In this context the provisions of the general working time Directive Directive 2003/88/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, OJ L 299, 18.11.2003, p 9‑19. would apply to employed taxi drivers. However according to the report mentioned by the Honourable Member, the vast majority of taxi drivers are self-employed and are therefore excluded from the scope of Directive 2003/88 and thus would not be covered by EC working time legislation. According to the information available to the Commission, Ireland has made use in its transposing legislation of a derogation provided in Article 17.1 of Directive 2003/88 for those taxi drivers who can be considered as employees within the meaning of the directive. Under this provision, Member States may allow derogations from the relevant provisions of the directive (on daily rests, breaks, weekly rest periods, maximum weekly rest periods, annual leave, length of night work), in the case of workers who can organise autonomously their working time. So far the Commission did not receive any complaint regarding this issue.
