WRITTEN QUESTION E-2174/10 by Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) to the Commission (7 April 2010) Subject: Protection of consumers against the health risks posed by chicken contaminated by bacteria The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recently indicated in a report that 75.8% of chickens leaving European slaughterhouses were contaminated with Campylobacter and 15.7% were contaminated with Salmonella . These figures are the result of a whole series of tests carried out in 2008 in slaughterhouses in the EU, Switzerland and Norway. Since salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis are two of the most frequently reported food-borne illnesses in humans, can the Commission answer the following questions. 1. What action does the Commission propose to take to reinforce the safety and certification rules and the control mechanisms in slaughterhouses, in order to guarantee consumer health protection? 2. Are comparative data from similar analyses also available for 2009?
