WRITTEN QUESTION E-4757/05 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Council (15 December 2005) Subject: Cost of the EU Presidency The cost of the EU Presidency in the first half of 2006 is estimated by the Austrian Government at EUR 57 million, although other sources assume total costs of EUR 82 million. Finland estimates the cost of its EU Presidency, in the second half of 2006, at between EUR 50 and 55 million and quotes a cost of EUR 64 million for its Council Presidency in 1999. 1. How much does the Council Presidency cost on average, according to experiences so far, and/or how high were the respective costs of Council Presidencies to date (since the beginning)? 2. What are the costs of the necessary security measures and expenditure on various events (e.g. EU summit)? 3. Following an EU Council Presidency, do Member States exchange experiences according to best-practice principles, in order to identify where costs may be saved? 4. How can the Council justify this type of high expenditure, in light of the financial strain in the individual countries, which at times requires its citizens to make considerable sacrifices? 5. Where are the potential savings with regard to this?
