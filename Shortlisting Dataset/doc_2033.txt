Question for written answer E-002429/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Gianni Vattimo (ALDE) (1 March 2012) Subject: US actions against WikiLeaks, Julian Assange and alleged Anonymous activists On 27 February 2012 WikiLeaks launched ‘The Global Intelligence Files’, which reveal that US law enforcement agencies have secretly indicted — apparently for terrorism and conspiracy — Julian Assange and people connected to WikiLeaks; they are pushing for Assange’s extradition to the US, and wish to apply to him and other people connected to WikiLeaks the same policy as that adopted by the US in respect of al-Qa’ida. Following the publication, including via international media, of the Stratfor files held by a ‘parallel CIA’, Interpol has carried out a series of arrests of alleged Anonymous activists aged between 16 and 40. Is the Commission aware of these facts? Does it think they are compatible with the Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights? What will the Commission do to ensure that Assange, WikiLeaks activists and people connected with the media are not persecuted or extradited to the US, as they risk being subjected to secret procedures leading to persecution, torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, including imprisonment in Guantanamo, as has been the case for others? Can it confirm that the EU‑US Extradition Convention does not allow for such extraditions? In relation to WikiLeaks activists, Assange and alleged Anonymous activists, what will the Commission do to ensure that freedom of information, secrecy of journalistic sources, freedom of expression and demonstration, the right to a fair trial and the right not to be extradited to a country where people are at risk of being persecuted, tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, including incommunicado detention and military trials, are respected in the EU as provided for in the Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights?
