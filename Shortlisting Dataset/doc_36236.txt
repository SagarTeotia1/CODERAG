Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (19 March 2010) The respect for the rights of persons belonging to minorities is one of the values on which the European Union is founded. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this is explicitly mentioned in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits explicitly any discrimination on grounds of language or of membership of a national minority. The Commission will ensure within the scope of its mandate that these fundamental rights are respected in EC law, including when Member States implement them. There is a number of EU legislation and programmes which can contribute to improve the situation of persons belonging to minorities. The Commission intends to combine these instruments to address certain difficulties, including discrimination, which are likely to affect persons belonging to minorities. The existing EU anti-discrimination legislation Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29.06.2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, OJ L 180 (2000), p. 22 and Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27.11.2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303(200), p. 16. will continue to be used to ensure the equal treatment of persons belonging to minorities. The Commission has adopted a proposal for a new Directive Proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, of 2.07.2008, COM(2008)426 final. , currently under discussion, which would extend protection against discrimination on grounds of religion and belief, disability, age and sexual orientation to fields other than employment and occupation. Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA, OJ L 328 of 6.12.2008, p. 55. aims to ensure that hate speech — on the grounds of race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin — and hate crimes are penalised in all Member States. The Commission is monitoring the implementation of this framework Decision as closely as possible. A group of national experts has been created to this end. In addition, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive), OJ L 298 of 17. 10. 1989, p. 23, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997, OJ L 202 of 30.7.1997, p. 60, and Directive 2007/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007, OJ L 332, 18.12.2007, p. 27. bans hate speech in audiovisual media services by prohibiting any incitement to hatred based on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.
