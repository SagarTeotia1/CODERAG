in unskilled jobs in export industries has grown steadily, which gives them opportunities for more income and control over how the family income is spent, but these women receive lower wages than men for the same work and their working conditions and job security are inferior to those of men, M. whereas when women have more control over the use to which the family income is put, more is invested in their children’s education and in health care and food, which helps to reduce poverty, 1. Recognises that the principle of free movement of goods and services may be an effective way of helping poor countries to develop, on condition that their problems and interests are specifically taken into account; 2. Calls for a systematic analysis of the gender dimension of trade expansion that examines the various trends and takes into account the complexity of the issues and factors involved, such as women’s access to economic and technical resources, their participation in the labour market, rates and patterns of discrimination and the gender divide in the labour market, women’s access to education and their level of education and their access to health care and socio-cultural resources; 3. Takes note of new data provided by UNIFEM, which show that in today’s global economy poor working women are predominantly concentrated in the informal economy, where they lack job security and safety, have no benefits or labour protection and where their earnings are too meagre to enable them to pull themselves out of poverty; 4. Notes that women benefit less from the opportunities presented by liberalisation of trade and globalisation, while at the same time they are harder hit by the adverse effects of those phenomena, and urges the EU therefore, in its trade-related assistance programmes, to devote specific attention to increasing opportunities for women to participate in trade, with particular emphasis on international trade; 5. Calls for a systematic analysis to be made of unpaid work, which is primarily performed by women, in the statistics of international economic institutions; 6. Notes that, in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations which the Commission conducts on behalf of the Member States, little or no effort is made to assess the gender-related impact of future trade agreements, and calls on the Commission, as a matter of routine, to make a gender analysis of the impact of European proposals in trade negotiations at macro and micro level; 7. Calls on international economic institutions and the Commission to contribute to the exchange of best practices with regard to improving living and working conditions, particularly in developing countries, inter alia by means of better reconciliation of work and family life; 8. Calls on international economic institutions and the Commission to devise measures and programmes to promote the role of women in developing countries’ economic life, particularly by encouraging a spirit of enterprise through education and by providing financial assistance, including micro-credits; 9. Considers that social development is a cornerstone of trade policy and calls on the relevant international organisations and on governments to eliminate all forms of discrimination, including gender disparities
