Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (5 September 2011) The Commission is aware of press articles referring to pensions paid to deceased people and alleged cases of fraud in disability pensions in Greece. It has no direct competence for dealing with such cases. Effectively investigating suspicion of fraud and related offences regarding pensions is, however, an essential responsibility of any state of law, in particular in times of budgetary austerity. The Commission therefore does encourage Greece, along with the other Member States, to evaluate the effectiveness of key policies and institutions, including in the field of pensions, when assessing national reform programmes and in the mutual learning process, which involves scrutinising specific policies, programmes and institutional arrangements, under the Europe 2020 strategy. In the specific case of Greece, the ‘medium-term fiscal strategy through 2015’ which was recently voted by the Hellenic Parliament provides for a reform of the disability pension system, a census of pensioners and cross-checking of personal data in order to fight fraud and reduce unwarranted expenditure. These measures are specific requirements of the memorandum of understanding between Greece and the Commission (on behalf of the euro-area Member States) in the context of the financial assistance that is currently being provided to Greece by the euro-area Member States and the IMF.
