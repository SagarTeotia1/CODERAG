UN). There was a war. What are you expecting from the EU summit on the subject organised by France for 1 September? The EU supports Georgia through its neighbourhood policy. The situation there is fragile and so long as these conflicts remain unresolved we can't move forward. It is urgent that we regulate the situation. Europe must continue to preserve its values. The 27 countries must unite to defend democracy and demand that Russia comes to an agreement over the resolution of the situation. Georgia's sovereignty and its borders were recognised by all parties, including Russia. The EU must not flinch, because the Georgians have been let down by the US and are counting on the EU to help them. The Council must have the courage to take the decisions it has failed to take since the start of the tensions 2-3 years ago. My delegation backs the prospect of EU entry for Georgia and the other countries of the South Caucasus...They are turning to NATO to ensure their safety, to which Russia objects and which was a part of the reason for the crisis. It is more clear than ever that the EU must agree on major international issues. Monday the Duma asked for the recognition of the independence of S outh Ossetia and Abkhazia. Is the territorial integrity of Georgia under threat? Russia 's recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is a sword of Damocles, that we knew was there. After Kosovo, Putin anticipated the consequences on the two regions. But the difference is that in Kosovo, it is the international community that is working for independence. We are for self-determination, but it must be by all the people. In 1994, about 70% of the Georgian population living in Abkhazia was forced to leave the region and take refuge elsewhere. You can only have self-determination when all the inhabitants have returned, including the Georgians from Abkhazia. In addition, Georgia's borders were recognised by all. Russia won't allow Chechen independence but defends the independence of these two separatist territories at the same time as it recognises the territorial integrity of Georgia! There is an obvious contradiction. After this interview was conducted, Russia Tuesday noon announced its unilateral decision to recognise the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. The European Parliament is following the situation in the Caucasus closely. The "Headlines" and "Press Service" pages of this website will provide news of developments in Parliament as they occur. Several political groups have requested a debate and a resolution for adoption during next week’s plenary session. 20080825STO35399 Press release : Georgian Foreign Minister calls on EU to send mission to Georgia Information from the delegation to the South Caucasus Isler Béguin: Georgian elections a "step forward for democracy" (9/1/08 EN 1 PHOTO 20080825PHT35434.jpg EN 3 LINK /activities/delegations/publicationsDel.do;jsessionid=AA1AD671B8331BC95DD0E6BB8DE23FA9.node1?body=DSCA&language=EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20080821IPR35353 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20080107STO17492 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN
