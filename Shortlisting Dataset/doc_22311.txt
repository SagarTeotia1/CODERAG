Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (27 February 2008) The Commission would like to remind the Honourable Member that Article 137 paragraph 5 of the EC Treaty does not allow the Community to regulate the right to strike and the right to impose lock-outs See paragraph 40 of the Viking Line judgment of 11.12.2007, Case C‑438/05. . This does not mean, as the Court of Justice held in its judgment in the Viking Line case, that collective action as such is excluded from the scope of application of Community law. On the contrary, the Court has made it clear that the exercise of the fundamental right to take collective action (including the right to strike) has to respect prevailing Community law and may be subject to certain restrictions. It follows from the same judgment that trade unions will continue to be able to take collective action for the purpose of protecting workers against service providers that want to establish in another Member State, provided that these actions are justified by a legitimate aim compatible with the EC Treaty, appropriate to attain such an aim and proportionate. It is ultimately for the national courts to determine whether, and to what extent, these conditions apply to the specific cases at hand.
