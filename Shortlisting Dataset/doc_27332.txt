Question for written answer E-001002/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (9 February 2011) Subject: Community patent's discriminatory language regime A procedure was recently opened and is currently ongoing in the European Union aimed at establishing ‘enhanced cooperation’ in the field of patent registration and protection. It is hard to see the reasoning behind the language options chosen, since some of the most widely spoken and widely used languages will be left out in favour of other languages that are much less widely used at world level. It does not make sense to seek to impose a regime in the European Union that gives preference to three languages whilst all the remaining 20 official languages of the EU are placed at a disadvantage and discriminated against. Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states that ‘citizenship of the Union is hereby established’ (paragraph 1) and that all citizens of the Union have the right ‘to address the institutions and advisory bodies of the Union in any of the Treaty languages and to obtain a reply in the same language’ (paragraph 2(d)). The institutions are those listed in Article 13 of the EU Treaty, and the Treaty languages are the 23 official languages expressly mentioned in Article 55 of the EU Treaty. Portuguese — Europe’s third most important world language and therefore an important European language in the service of our common area — will suffer inexplicable discrimination with the adoption of an ‘enhanced cooperation’ procedure. Can the Commission answer the following questions: Bearing in mind that the final decision on approving enhanced cooperation within the Council is scheduled for 10 March 2011, does the Commission not believe that, if it were to approve the procedure, this would have the effect of disregarding the Treaties, harming the internal market and economic, social and territorial cohesion and introducing a new discriminating factor into trade between the Member States, resulting in distortions? Does it consider it legitimate that a group of Member States should seek to make such use of the ‘enhanced cooperation’ provided for and regulated in Article 20 of the Treaty on European Union and Articles 326 et seq. of the TFEU?
