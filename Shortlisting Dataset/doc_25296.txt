Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (21 May 2010) In the light of further information on the operation of the tax received from the Irish authorities, the Commission has analysed the tax and its compatibility with provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enshrining the freedom to provide services (Article 56) as well as Article 15(1) of Regulation 1008/2008 which lays down the conditions for the operation of air services by carriers within the European Union Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community (r ecast) OJ L 293, 31.10.2008. . It should be noted that EU legislation does not prohibit such duties. However, the tax is levied at two different rates depending upon the distance of a given flight's destination from Dublin Airport. The Commission is concerned that may mean that substantially different conditions are imposed on cross-border flights compared to those operated within Ireland and that the tax could, therefore, constitute an infringement of European law. The Commission is currently investigating the case accordingly.
