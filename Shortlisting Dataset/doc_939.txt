regulatory failure in the supervision of the life assurance sector in general and in the supervision of Equitable Life's business practices and financial standing in particular. The committee also analyzed allegations of regulatory failure in the protection of policyholders and consumers due to incorrect implementation of the Third Life Directive Directive 92/96/EEC of 10 November 1992, in OJ L 360 of 9.12.1992. , assessing in particular how the UK regulatory system compared when judged against its peers in an EU environment. The findings of the Penrose report The Treasury set up Lord Penrose’s inquiry in August 2001. The terms of reference were: “ To enquire into the circumstances leading to the current situation of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, taking account of relevant life market background; to identify any lessons to be learnt for the conduct, administration and regulation of life assurance business; and to give a report thereon to Treasury Ministers .” The Penrose report was published on 8 March 2004. and the Baird report The Baird Report, " The Regulation of Equitable Life: an independent report " prepared by Ronnie Baird, Director, Quality Assurance and Internal Audit, FSA, assisted by Norton Rose and PricewaterhouseCoopers, was published by the Treasury on 17 October 2001. , whose investigations overlap with parts of the committee's mandate, were taken as a starting point but considered in a wider European context An ongoing investigation by the UK Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PO) should also determine whether the relevant UK regulatory regime was properly administered. The first report by the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman, published in June 2003, did not find prudential regulators guilty of maladministration in the period 1999-2000 and ruled that no compensation was due to investors. The second report extended the time period covered by the investigation and included the GAD in its scope. The publication of the 2nd UK Parliamentary Ombudsman's report on Equitable Life, originally due for autumn 2006, has been delayed until May 2007 and its findings could therefore not be included in this report. In her letter to MPs on 16 October 2006 (coincidently, the same day of the EQUI delegation visit to London), the Ombudsman wrote: 'it became clear that evidence that appeared to be of potential relevance to the matters under investigation had not been disclosed to us... We received this evidence in July and August 2006 ' (Annex to WE-FILE19). Mr. BRAITHWAITE (H11) deplored that this "' truck load' of new written evidence from 2001 which had previously been concealed from the Penrose inquiry... seems to have succeeded in ensuring that the EQUI report will not be able to quote from the PO's investigation. .
