maintenance of aid for seed at the current level is to be welcomed as it is required to ensure a market balance between production and outlets. There are no objections either to scrapping the differentiation between three varieties of Lolium perenne L seed which currently receive aid. However, the introduction of a stabiliser (maximum quantity eligible for aid in the EU) could be a problem if it jeopardises the further development of organic farming in the future, given that the aid is almost exclusively for fodder plant seed. An ecologically rational extension of the cultivation of fodder plants for fodder production and as a catch crop to maintain well-conditioned soil and healthy crop rotation will entail further demand for seed, a process which the introduction of a stabiliser must not inhibit. If the Commission's assertion that stocks and exports are constantly increasing is correct, then this clearly indicates that more seeds are being produced than can be actually disposed of on the Community market. As regards the need to curb expenditure, there can be no objection to introducing the stabiliser as such at national level. The proposal to introduce a stabiliser mechanism is extremely vaguely worded however. (It is merely stated that the stabiliser should operate in the same way as it does in the rice sector). There are no specific details covering essential points such as the maximum guaranteed quantities, the procedure for calculating, and the type and extent of the reduction in aid in the event of exceeding the maximum quantities eligible for aid. The Commission would leave these points, which are so fundamental to the seed sector, to be decided by a management committee. This is not the appropriate procedure, however, given the financial significance of those decisions for the sector; as the Community's legislative bodies, the Council and Parliament are the appropriate decision-makers in this case
