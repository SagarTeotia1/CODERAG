Preliminary answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2006) In so far as cremation and other associated funeral services are offered against remuneration, they could be considered as services falling under the scope of the Treaty's internal market provisions on free provision of services and freedom of establishment. The Honourable Member suggests that the Greek Government has not introduced the necessary measures to allow for crematoriums to be built in Greece and that this could have implications as regards these internal market principles. The Commission is writing to the Greek authorities for clarifications on this issue and will inform the Honourable Member of its findings.
