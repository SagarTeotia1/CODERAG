Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (6 September 2006) The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member. In its communication of 2 June 2004, the Commission emphasised that the ‘development of judicial cooperation in civil matters must continue to make tangible improvements in the daily life of individuals and businesses by enabling them to assert their rights at Union level’ Communication from the Commission to the Council and Parliament. Area of Freedom, Security and Justice: Assessment of the Tampere programme and future orientations, 2.6.2004, COM(2004)401 final. . In this respect, it mentioned the facilitation of mutual recognition of documents as an area of increasing importance. It also mentioned that it might prove useful to facilitate mutual recognition in new fields, such as the civil status of individuals. Legalisation has been abolished for documents falling under the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 (‘the Brussels I Regulation’) Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, OJ L 12, 16.1.2001. and Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 of 29 May 2000 (‘the Brussels II Regulation’) Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 of 29 May 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses, OJ L 160, 30.6.2000.

However, there is no comprehensive Community instrument in this field, which to a large extent remains governed by national law and international conventions. Consequently, many documents, such as wills and testaments, land registry records, company registry records and civil status records do not benefit from EU rules on mutual recognition. Although all Member States except Denmark are Contracting Parties to the 1961 Hague Convention on the abolition of the requirement for the legalisation of documents Convention of 5 October 1961 abolishing the requirement of legalisation for foreign public documents. , this very useful Convention has not completely abolished legalisation. Lack of mutual recognition and disparities between national laws may cause various practical problems to EU citizens and businesses. As pointed out by the Honourable Member, very often a document may not be accepted by the relevant authorities of another Member State unless it has been legalised or authenticated by some other such formality. Such procedures, which can sometimes be both lengthy and costly, may impede or adversely affect the exercise of one or more of the Treaty rights such as right of establishment or freedom of movement of citizens. In order to assess the need for Community action in this field, the Commission launched a study in 2006 on legalisation. Once completed, this study will include a comparative analysis of the laws and procedures of the Member States in this field as well as an empirical analysis of the practical problems encountered by citizens and businesses in the EU as a
