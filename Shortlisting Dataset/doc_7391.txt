WRITTEN QUESTION E-0146/05 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE-DE) to the Commission (24 January 2005) Subject: Debate on the use of nuclear energy The former European Commissioner for Energy has recently called for an open, transparent, taboo-free debate on the use of nuclear energy. Today, her suggestion is more relevant than ever, as increasing oil prices show that the EU is too dependent on the use of oil to satisfy its energy requirements. Does the Commission believe that it must propose and sponsor the open, transparent and taboo-free debate on the use of nuclear energy advocated by the former European Commissioner for Energy?
