The new programmes put more emphasis on monitoring through the use of indicators. As a result, the Greek authorities will report on the number of participants who have benefited from active labour-market policies, including traineeship projects, training courses, projects for new professionals. In addition, they will report on the number of registered unemployed who have benefited from active labour-market policies and have found, or remain in, employment for six months after the action ends. The detailed national arrangements for data collection and evaluation are under preparation by the lead Ministries and it is expected that they will be finalised before the fourth quarter 2008.
