despite the fact that human rights principles are included in the text of the Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan and that Uzbekistan has signed and ratified most UN conventions relating to human rights, civil and political rights and the rights of the child, this formal set of legal acts still needs to be implemented effectively; (ii) Outline the importance of the relations between the Union and Uzbekistan on the basis of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and its democratic and human rights principles; reiterate the Union's commitment to further and deepen bilateral relations, which include trade, as well as all areas related to democratic principles, respect for human and fundamental rights and the rule of law; (iii) Strongly condemn the use of forced child labour and outline the importance of international observers to monitor the development of the situation of forced labour in Uzbekistan, as well as in other countries in the region; (iv) Support the request by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to assess the situation regarding the alleged practice of forced labour and in particular forced child labour in harvesting cotton; insist in this regard on the Uzbek Government implementing comprehensively the formal prohibition of this practice in Uzbek legislation and the international conventions ratified by Uzbekistan; stress the need to establish reforms to modernise and motorise the agricultural sector, which would contribute significantly to the abolition of forced child labour; (v) Urge the Uzbek President Islam Karimov to allow an ILO monitoring mission into the country to address the issue of child labour practices; (vi) Actively contribute to the improvement of the social, economic and human rights situation of the population of Uzbekistan by promoting a bottom-up approach and by supporting civil society organisations and the media in order to achieve a sustainable democratisation process; 2. Concludes that Parliament will only consider the consent after international observers, in particular the ILO, have been granted access by the Uzbek authorities to undertake close and unhindered monitoring and have confirmed that concrete reforms have been implemented and yielded substantial results in such a way that the practice of forced labour and child labour is effectively in the process of being eradicated at national, viloyat and local level.
