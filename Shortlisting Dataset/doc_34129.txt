WRITTEN QUESTION E-4386/08 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (6 August 2008) Subject: Damage to the environment in the area of Aliveri (Evvia) The heavy concentration of industrial plant belonging to the DEH public power corporation and the AGET Iraklis cement manufacturer among others, together with numerous smaller factories and light industries in the area of Aliveri (Evvia) situated immediately opposite the eastern shore of Attiki is resulting in high levels of industrial pollution in that area. Samples examined in the course of investigations by the University of Patras previously and the Chemical Engineering Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki more recently have revealed high concentrations of nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) in the marine environment. In addition, further industrial activities are being projected in this area, including large DEH power stations fired by natural gas (400 MW) and coal (800 MW), together with the installation by AGET Iraklis of a large desalination plant in the closed-in Aliveri Bay. This will cause even further damage to the environment and increase pollutant greenhouse gas emissions. The operation of this plant means that Greece is failing to comply with its European and international commitments. Is the Commission aware of the damage being done to the environment in the Aliveri area? Does it consider that Directive 2001/42/EC OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p. 30. concerning a strategic study of the environmental impact of operational and projected industrial plant, as transposed into Greek law, is being properly implemented? Is the operation of existing plant being monitored on a regular and ongoing basis by the responsible authorities to ensure compliance with environmental protection requirements and what is the resulting assessment? Does the Commission intend to impose penalties on Greece for any infringements? What penalties does it intend to impose?
