the European Union (mission SANCO 2011/6027, 8-15 February 2011 http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/ir_search_en.cfm ). It was concluded that the official export control programmes and the auto-controls of food business operators generally provide assurance that food of plant origin exported to the EU complies with legal limits for pesticide residues. Some shortcomings that were identified by the inspection team have been addressed. The available data give no indication to suspect a lower hygiene status or other differences in food safety parameters for produce from Morocco compared to EU production. The Commission is not in a position to comment on environmental standards applicable to agricultural production in Morocco.
