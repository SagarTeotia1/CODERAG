WRITTEN QUESTION E-2043/05 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (7 June 2005) Subject: Europe's endangered flora According to a report by French scientists, Europe's flora and fauna have been affected significantly by climate change and are now at risk. On the basis of the criteria established by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), at least 50 % of Europe's plants will probably be classified as endangered by 2080. Given the results of this research, which is published in the Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), what does the Commission propose to do to avert this environmental disaster? Does it intend to take specific action so as to protect the species concerned, in particular to avoid them being classified as endangered?
