WRITTEN QUESTION P-2669/06 by Werner Langen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 June 2006) Subject: Situation in the prison in Bucharest, Romania In a capacity as a prisoner awaiting trial and an eye witness, an EU citizen from Belgium has reported serious human rights violations in Romanian prisons. Prisoners are the victims of bodily harm, they are denied urgently needed medication, they are pacified against their will with harmful tranquilisers, subsequently becoming addicted to these drugs, contact with embassy representatives and family members is prohibited, the Romanian prosecution service refuses to have the indictment translated or employs a translator with inadequate training, prison cells are heavily overcrowded, food is distributed only once a day, the light in the cells is constantly on, the bodily hygiene of prisoners is subject to the whims of the prison warders and, prior to trials, prisoners usually spend seven hours chained to each other in handcuffs, unable to go to the toilet or to drink anything, guarded by warders with guns loaded with live ammunition. 1. Is the Commission aware of these conditions? 2. What measures will the Commission take to monitor whether and how Romania respects human rights or acts to see that they are enforced? 3. How does the Commission intend to exert pressure on Romania in the context of the accession negotiations to ensure that the country genuinely fulfils the relevant criteria, particularly with regard to the penal system, on the scheduled date of accession?
