WRITTEN QUESTION P-2617/06 by Anne Jensen (ALDE) to the Commission (9 June 2006) Subject: Sewerage system in the northern parts of St Petersburg The sewerage system in St Petersburg is in a very poor condition, with serious consequences for several EU countries. The city of St Petersburg is the largest single source of pollution in the whole Baltic Sea. Much of the city’s waste water is not treated and flows directly out into the Gulf of Finland. Increasing concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are damaging the ecological balance of the Gulf and its biological life. In the past, the EU has been involved in funding effective and modern facilities for the collection and treatment of waste water from the southern parts of the city. However, we have still done nothing for the northern part of the city. Under budget heading 19 06 01 in the 2006 budget, it was decided that ‘Part of this appropriation should be used, with due regard for the provisions of the Financial Regulation, to fund the construction and restoration of the sewage network in the northern parts of St. Petersburg’. In other words, it is not stated how much money will be set aside for this project. Can the Commission say how much money is intended to be spent on this project? What specific initiatives have been taken in this area? What cooperation partners does the Commission have in Russia? And what is the timescale for the project?
