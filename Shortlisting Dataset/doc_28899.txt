to committee 4. If the proposal for a postponement of discharge is rejected the report shall be referred back to committee and a new report containing a proposal to grant or refuse to grant discharge presented to the next part-session. 4a (new) Where, at this stage of the procedure, a proposal for a decision granting or refusing to grant discharge is rejected by plenary, the committee responsible shall submit to plenary, at the next part-session, a proposal for a decision opposite to that rejected. 4b (new) If discharge is refused, the competent committee shall submit a proposal for a decision formally closing the accounts to the next part-session. If discharge is granted, the granting of discharge shall be equivalent to closure of the accounts. 5. Parliament shall decide on the proposals for a decision by a majority of the votes cast, pursuant to Article 198 of the EC Treaty. Justification This procedure foresees the possibility both of a clear decision in April and of postponement, followed by a second report by the end of October (before new discharge begins) and a clear exit strategy for the discharge procedure. It is also proposed to continue with the current procedure of only admitting amendments in plenary to the motion for resolution whilst leaving the outcome of the discharge decision itself to a plenary vote. To do otherwise would result in confused procedures . Or. en
