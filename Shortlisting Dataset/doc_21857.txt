Question for written answer E-5585/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Ria Oomen-Ruijten (PPE) and Wim van de Camp (PPE) (19 July 2010) Subject: Imports of khat and financing of terrorist organisations Recent reports in the media indicate that imports and sales of khat in the Netherlands are financing terrorist organisations in Somalia and elsewhere or that sales of khat are controlled by organised criminals. What information does the Commission have concerning the link between imports of khat and terrorist organisations? Is it true that the consumption and sale of khat is legal only in the Netherlands and the UK? How should imports, consumption and sale of khat be dealt with in the EU? Will the Commission investigate this?
