ORAL QUESTION H-1014/05 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Mairead McGuinness to the Commission Subject: The operation of foreign-registered vessels in EU waters The issue of 'outsourcing' has become commonplace in the transport sector. This reflects modern business trends, and this phenomenon is evident in a wide range of sectors of Europe's economy. However, the outsourcing of crews working on ferries, where the ferry in question is registered outside the EU, highlights a serious anomaly with regard to the rights of persons working in this part of the transport sector. In particular, the flag state (i.e. the state where the ship is registered) has the exclusive right to exercise legislative and enforcement jurisdiction over its ships on the high seas. Therefore, the terms and conditions of employment on foreign-registered ships are a matter for the flag state, in accordance with international maritime law and practice. This situation brings the existing labour legislation of the EU and its Member States into disrepute. In December 2004, the Commission published a working paper on a possible European-level social partner agreement on manning conditions for ferries. Can the Commission clarify what steps have been taken since the publication of this working paper and whether it intends to submit a proposal for legislation in this area?
