ORAL QUESTION H-0567/04 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by José Ribeiro e Castro to the Council Subject: Cuba In November 2004 the European Parliament once again expressed its views with regard to Cuba. Even Cuba's democrats are expressing criticism and concern regarding the announced proposals to soften the EU's stance vis-à-vis Fidel Castro's dictatorship, in a show of apparent ideological inferiority and reverential fear. Is the Council aware of the European Parliament's views on Cuba? Or does it pay more attention to Fidel Castro and disregard Cuba's democrats? Does it deem acceptable an EU policy which is so subordinate to the views expressed and the pressures exerted by a communist dictatorship that it results in a failure to invite Cuba's democrats to meet the EU's and its Member States' representations, thereby directly prolonging the persecution of those individuals and their exclusion from society?
