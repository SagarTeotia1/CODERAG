Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (27 September 2010) On July 7, 2010, the Commission has launched a Europe-wide public debate on how to ensure adequate, sustainable and safe pensions and how the EU can best support the national efforts. The Green Paper reviews the European pension framework in a holistic and integrated manner, benefiting from synergies across economic and social policy and financial market regulation. The consultation period will run for four months (ending 15 November 2010). The Commission will then analyse all responses and consider the best course for future actions to address these issues at EU level, including the possibility of presenting a follow-up White Paper.
