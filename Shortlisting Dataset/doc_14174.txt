to replace the inefficient comitology procedure as soon as possible; 17. Considers that transfers can be a powerful tool to facilitate political, as well as financial, responses to situations arising after the adoption of the budget, notably unforeseeable major international events, and to optimise the use of financial resources; 18. Emphasises, however, that transfers must not simply be used to shift budgetary funds from one area to another so that the final budget would contradict the priorities voted by the budgetary authority; points out that more than € 2 billion in payment appropriations were transferred during the 2001 budgetary procedure, and calls on the Commission to make use inter alia of the supplementary and amending budget procedure to deal with unforeseen situations; 19. Reiterates its request that the Commission should present a programming for the transfers it intends to request from one chapter to the other, in particular during the last quarter, in order to allow Parliament and Council a sound and adequate evaluation of these and to provide a clear picture of how the initial budget would be finally modified; 20. Stresses that it will, in principle, not accept any transfer request that reduces budget lines voted by Parliament unless convincing justifications can be provided and adequate proposals are presented to improve the implementation of the donor line; 21. Underlines that it can accept the increase of budget lines through transfers, in principle, if: - a justified need, which could not be foreseen during the budgetary procedure, appears, - under multiannual programmes agreed by the Council and the Parliament, the amount can be reduced in following years so as not to breach the established overall financial framework, - the transfer corresponds to a political priority of the budgetary authority. 22. States that additional needs could be covered by the mobilisation of the emergency reserve (heading 6), and asks the Commission to consider this possibility in particular if natural disasters, wars or crises make EU aid important for the population concerned by these situations; Implementation under various headings 23. Underscores that it will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the 2002 budget as adopted by Parliament so that sufficient appropriations are provided for areas of particular political importance; 24. Notes with satisfaction that, as at 31 May, the commitments implementation level for headings 2, 3 and 4 was higher than on the same date in 2001, though it was lower than the original implementation profile; voices its concern at the potential political repercussions, in the context of preparing for enlargement, of the very low implementation level for heading 7; also notes that, as at 31 May 2002, the payments implementation level was lower than on the same date in 2001, thus sowing doubt as to keeping to the original profile; 25. Deplores the fact that most of the programmes where the Commission is forecasting about 10% divergence from the budgetary authority's decision, in terms of commitments or payments, represent political priorities for Parliament (e-learning, information and communication, social dimension and employment, justice and home affairs, cooperation with Latin America, cooperation measures,
