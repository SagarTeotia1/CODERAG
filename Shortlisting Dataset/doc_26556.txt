WRITTEN QUESTION E-5188/09 by Fiorello Provera (EFD) to the Commission (21 October 2009) Subject: Death sentences on opposition activists in Iran The Iranian authorities have just passed death sentences on Mohammad Reza Ali-Zamani, 37, and two other opposition supporters, identified only by their initials. According to the charges against them, the three condemned persons are members of opposition groups who took part in the demonstrations sparked off by the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Will the Commission monitor the proceedings against these three condemned persons, as is provided for in the guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders? Will it ask the Iranian authorities to grant a stay of execution to the three condemned persons concerned and all others sentenced to death on political grounds? Does it not believe that it should increase support for Iranian civil society, using the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights?
