Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (8 February 2012) The Commission does not have the report quoted by the Honourable Member, and the figures therein. According to data from Eurostat, the number of suicides among 15‑19 years old in the 27 EU Member States has increased from 1 355 in 2007 to 1 467 in 2008 and then seems to have slightly declined to 1 424 in 2009, the last year for which data are available (the 2009 figures do not however include the number of suicides in 2 large countries (France and Italy) and therefore are to be interpreted with caution). Below is the number of suicides in EU‑27 Note: the EU‑27 aggregate does not include data for Belgium (2006-2009), France (2009) and Italy (2009). and Greece, 2004-2009 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 EU‑27 1 569 (p) 1 450 (p) 1 437 (p) 1 355 (p) 1 467 (p) 1 424 (p) Greece 8 9 6 9 3 6 The European Commission has fostered discussions on how to address depression also among young people, in the context of the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being. Depression is also one of the issues for exchange and cooperation between those Member States who will participate in the Joint Action on Mental Health and Well-being foreseen in the 2012 workplan of the EU‑Health Programme adopted by the Commission on 1 December 2011.
