WRITTEN QUESTION E-4311/07 by Marianne Mikko (PSE) and Charles Tannock (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 September 2007) Subject: Effectiveness of the EU travel ban for the Transnistrian leadership In February 2003, the EU and the US imposed entry restrictions on members of the Transnistrian political leadership considered to be primarily responsible for the lack of cooperation in finding a political settlement of the conflict. The ban was renewed and the list of personae non gratae reviewed in February 2006. However, the Transnistrian leadership still enjoys considerable freedom of movement. With the consent of the Ukrainian authorities, they are able to travel freely to Odessa, with its international airport, but also to Kiev and to many destinations reachable from there. This makes a mockery of the EU travel ban and delays the solution of the Transnistrian conflict. What is the Commission doing to persuade more of our ENP partners, in particular Ukraine, which is entitled to join EU CFSP common positions including travel bans, but also Russia, to join the countries denying entry to the separatist leadership of the self-proclaimed state of Transnistria? Does the Commission intend to include this item on the agenda of the EU‑Ukraine summit on 14 September 2007?
