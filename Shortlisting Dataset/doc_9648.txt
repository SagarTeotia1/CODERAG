Reply (30 May 2005) The objective of Regulation (EC) No. 2252/2004 is to establish standard security features and to integrate biometric identifiers into the travel documents and passports issued by Member States in order to render these documents more secure and to establish a more reliable link between the holder and the travel document, thus ensuring that it is better protected against fraudulent use. As for Member States' implementation of the Regulation, the Commission had originally proposed a deadline of 12 months. However, the preparatory work in the Council showed that this deadline was not deemed sufficient. Finally, the Council agreed on a 18 months deadline for the introduction of the facial image and 36 months for de introduction of the fingerprints in interoperable formats.
