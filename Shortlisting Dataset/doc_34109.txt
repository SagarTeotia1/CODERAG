Question for written answer E-9899/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 David Martin (S&D) (26 November 2010) Subject: European framework for market surveillance Member States have the responsibility for the market surveillance of products within their territories but this leads to the use of different definitions, different priorities and different levels of resources from country to country. Yet the internal market encourages free circulation of products within the EU. Does the Commission not feel that it is now necessary to share the burden and encourage harmonisation by bringing forward proposals for a comprehensive Europe-wide framework for market surveillance? Does it not agree with ANEC (Voice of Consumers Rights in Europe) — the European consumer voice — that even the best laws and best technical standards threaten to be fatally compromised by inadequate and inconsistent enforcement?
