The Commission has raised the issue with the Turkish authorities. Turkey, as a candidate country negotiating its accession to the EU, needs to guarantee in practice the right to freedom of religion. The 2010 Progress Report on Turkey states, in its section on freedom of religion, that members of minority religions continue to be subject to threats by extremists. It states also, that a legal framework, in line with the ECHR European Court of Human Rights. , has yet to be established, so that all non-Muslim religious communities can function without undue constraints.
