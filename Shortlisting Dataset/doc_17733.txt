Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2007) Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods, OJ L 404, 30.12.2006. establishes the process that will lead to the setting of nutrient profiles. Nutrient profiles, including exemptions, will be set after the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) consultation. EFSA will deliver its scientific opinion early 2008, and nutrient profiles will have to be set before January 2009, after consultation with the interested parties, including food business operators and consumer groups. The Commission mandate given to EFSA is public http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1178623953190.htm and it includes a request for scientific opinion regarding derogations, adjustments or exemptions that may be decided for certain food or categories of foods that could be identified by taking account of the provisions of Article 4(1): ‘(b) the role and importance of the food (or of categories of food) and the contribution to the diet of the population in general or, as appropriate, of certain risk groups including children; (c) the overall nutritional composition of the food and the presence of nutrients that have been scientifically recognised as having an effect on health.’ The mandate also lists potential candidates for these derogations, adjustments and exemptions, notably vegetable oils and fruits.
