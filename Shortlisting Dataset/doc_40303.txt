Answer given by Mr Figel' on behalf of the Commission (5 February 2008) The Commission is delighted to note that culture is thriving in all 27 Member States, as demonstrated by the huge number of awards won by European artists on the international stage and the many festivals and other international-level cultural events which take place in Europe every year, attracting an audience from around the world. This richness and cultural diversity make the European Union the most visited region in the world.
