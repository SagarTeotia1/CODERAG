package, in particular to start cooperating among themselves in order to promote regional and bilateral solidarity for the purpose of safeguarding secure supplies on the internal market; 41. Invites Member States and the Commission to develop major network investments and to complete the internal energy market through forward-looking initiatives such as the European transmission system operator and the establishment of a single European gas grid; 42. Calls on the Commission to bring forward to 2020 the objective of developing and completing a smart interconnected electricity network as an important ingredient for achieving the 2020-targets; 43. Calls on Member States to cooperate to draw up a European strategic plan with a view to multiannual programming of the investment necessary to meet future electricity generation needs on the basis of medium-term projections of energy requirements; believes that an indicative multiannual plan should also be envisaged in the gas sector to provide an overall view of investment requirements at European level; 44. Calls on Member States and relevant stakeholders to consult and coordinate future plans for cross-border infrastructure investments (grids, pipelines, and power plants for example) with relevant parties in all countries which could be affected by planned investments so as to make best use of available resources.; considers that the establishment of an Infrastructure Coordination Group at European level would help this coordination effort and could supplement the development of a 10-year network development plan as proposed in the internal energy market package; 45. Stresses that the completion of the internal energy market will be a success only if obstacles to investment are removed and physical connections linking all Member States to one common energy network are constructed and if the market makes it possible ultimately to avoid volatility of energy prices and to ensure a fair market for all generators and grid connection, access and integration of new energy producers and technologies; stresses that the recently revised Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32. provides, in a comprehensible and predictable manner, an assessment of CO2; External energy relations 46. Welcomes the Communication on the Second Strategic Energy Review, and in particular its proposals on external energy policy, which are broadly in line with the above-mentioned resolution of 26 September 2007; expresses disappointment about the lack of detailed proposals and underlines once more the need for further intensification of the Union's efforts to develop a coherent and effective common European foreign policy on energy with a renewed focus on energy-producing countries; 47. Calls on the Commission to support the inclusion of the so-called "energy security clause" in trade, association and partnership as well as cooperation agreements with producer and transit countries, which would lay down a code of conduct and prohibition of disruption due to commercial disputes, and explicitly outline measures to be taken in the event of unilateral disruption, or any change in the terms of the contract or in the terms of supply by one of the
