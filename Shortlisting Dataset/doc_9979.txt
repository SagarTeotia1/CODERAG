include a working group within the WTO on access to medicines, working alongside with the WHO and other international bodies to develop a global strategy; 24. Recognises that day-care health centres to test, diagnose, treat and monitor progress of treatment of these diseases including support for the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) strategy for tuberculosis are essential in implementing the EU Programme for Action; 25. Supports the creation of regional and sub-regional quality control laboratory networks to ensure quality control of test reagents and pharmaceuticals (including generics) being used for treatment of these communicable diseases, according to WHO-approved standards; 26. Supports the transfer of significant additional means to the relevant development funds budget lines to enable in particular capacity building in African research institutions so that scientific networks can to carry out for themselves field testing of new drugs and vaccines in coordination with European efforts; suggests, in this respect, that the approach developed by the African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network could be followed; 27. Urges the Commission to address as a matter of urgency the increasing prevalence of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, through the provision of appropriate pre and post natal care for both mothers and their children; 28. Calls on governments of the developing countries to facilitate prompt local registration of pharmaceutical products approved by the EU and other industrialised countries, so that they may be available to their public without undue delay; 29. Considers that although major pharmaceutical manufacturers of anti-retroviral and anti-malarial medicines have expressed the intention to reduce substantially their prices in the framework of special programmes of assistance to some governments of developing countries, prices continue to be beyond the reach of most people who are too poor to be able to afford them without public funding at the national and or global levels; 30. Calls on all major manufacturers of essential life-saving medicines to continue to collaborate with the EU and governments of the developing countries to offer, as a first step, further reductions (tiered pricing) in order to reach marginal costs, and as a second step, to implement a global tiered pricing system; 31. Recognises the need for appropriate global measures, including readily identifiable packaging to prevent re-importation to western countries of tiered priced products destined for the poor; calls on the Commission to also look at mechanisms at EU level to ensure against product diversion and to explore ways under the TRIPS Agreement of avoiding re-exportation of products destined for poor countries to developed-country markets; 32. Recognises that in the short term a tiered pricing system is a response to the problem of access to medicines for developing country populations, but stresses that in the long term it is only part of the solution to the problem of communicable diseases in the developing countries; 33. Calls for greater research and development efforts to find more sustainable ways of combating tropical diseases and to overcome the stagnation in developing new vaccines against tuberculosis; considers that the process of putting newly developed drugs to combat communicable diseases into production and bringing them into use
