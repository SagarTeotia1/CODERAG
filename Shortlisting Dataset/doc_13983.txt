ORAL QUESTION H-0679/08 for Question Time at the part-session in September II 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou to the Commission Subject: Air safety The recent Spanair disaster in Madrid in which many people were killed and the forced landing of a Ryanair Boeing 737 in Limoges in France, in which 26 people were injured, once again raise questions about whether the Community's arsenal of legislation and controls governing air safety is being adequately and effectively implemented. Regulation (EC) No. 1899/2006/ specifically lays down the obligation of airlines to carry out accident prevention and flight safety programmes and the requirements applicable to the operation of any civil aeroplane (certification, supervision, maintenance, instruments and equipment, safety, etc.). Does the Commission consider that these provisions are satisfactory and adequate, or does it believe that a more stringent control framework should be established for airlines? How does the Commission judge the implementation to date of Directive 2003/42/EC on occurrence reporting in civil aviation (adoption of a system of notification of accidents and serious incidents)? Does it consider that the aid provided so far for control mechanisms and early warning systems in respect of airlines with a dubious safety record and for the compliance inspections carried out by the European Aviation Safety Agency in respect of the airline authorities of Member States and the data released for establishing a blacklist is satisfactory? 1 OJ L377, 27.12.2006, p.1. 2 OJ L167, 4.7.2003, p.23.
