Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (8 June 2011) Article 33 of Directive 2009/31/EC (CCS Directive) Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the geological storage of carbon dioxide and amending Council Directive 85/337/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/60/EC, 2001/80/EC, 2004/35/EC, 2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, OJ L 140, 5.6.2009. indeed requires Member States to ensure, prior to granting a construction or operating licence, that operators of all combustion plants with a rated electrical output of 300 MW or more have assessed whether (a) suitable CO 2 storage sites are available, (b) transport facilities are technically and economically feasible, and (c) retrofitting for CO 2 capture is technically and economically feasible. If these conditions are met, sufficient space for possible provision of CO 2 capture and compression equipment must be set aside. Article 33 is an important element in assessing compliance with the terms of the CCS Directive. The Commission will therefore monitor the transposition and implementation by Member States of Article 33 and other requirements and will take appropriate steps if necessary.
