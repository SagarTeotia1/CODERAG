Executive Board of the European Central Bank for a term of office of eight years. Parliament's responsible Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs then proceeded to evaluate the credentials of the nominee, in particular in view of the requirements laid down in Article 112 of the Treaty and in the light of the need for full independence of the ECB pursuant to Article 110. In carrying out this evaluation, the Committee received a CV from the candidate (see Annex 1) as well as his replies to the written questionnaire that was sent out to him (see Annex 2). The committee subsequently held an hour-and-a-half hearing with the nominee on 6 April 2004, at which he made an opening statement (see Annex 3) and then responded to questions from members of the committee. (The full transcript of the hearing is available both in paper form and on the committee's Internet site.) Evaluation 2. The rapporteur considers that the nominee's record demonstrates that Mr José Manuel González-Páramo is an excellent candidate in terms of the main requirements laid down in the Treaty, namely personal integrity and recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters. All this was amply confirmed by the nominee's replies at the committee hearing on 6 April 2004. 3. Nevertheless, during the debate, Committee Members expressed the view that the ECB should be invited to organise a conference on the future of central banking in view of examining the evolving role of central banking in the EU, together with the European Parliament and representatives of the social partners.
