WRITTEN QUESTION E-6017/09 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (1 December 2009) Subject: Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) was signed back in 1990 by the heads of governments of the member countries of NATO and of the former Warsaw Pact. In 2007, Russia suspended the treaty in protest over the missile defence shield planned by the US. The NATO member countries, and hence the European Union too, have therefore had no information on Russia's conventional armed forces since 15 December 2007. In the meantime, President Obama has permanently shelved the missile defence shield project. Despite this, Russia has not lifted its suspension of the CFE Treaty. 1. Is the European Union aware of the strength of Russia's armed forces? 2. What possibilities does the EU see of tying Russia to the CFE again? 3. Will the European Union be issuing demands to Russia to resume compliance with the treaty?
