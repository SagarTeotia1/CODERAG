Reply (22 October 2007) As the Honourable Member certainly knows, the application of the Community legislation is a matter for the Commission. As regards possible legislative initiatives amending the Community legislation on the levy in the milk and milk products sector, the Council would like to point out that the responsibility of presenting new legislative proposals lies with the Commission. At this stage, the Council has not received any proposal from the Commission on this issue. When a proposal is transmitted to it, the Council will examine it carefully, taking into account the opinion of the European Parliament.
