Commission investigate Iberdrola’s takeover of Scottish Power for purposes of merger control, it should, in order to assess whether the operation is compatible with the common market, take into account any state aid when determining the financial strength of the merged entity See the abovementioned judgment in RJB Mining v Commission , paragraphs 117 et seq. . The state aid which Spain has undertaken gradually to remove in the context of Case E22/2004, in so far as it may be deemed to have been granted in this case, is therefore one of the elements which the Commission must take into account when assessing whether the concentration is compatible with the common market. The Commission is able to consider this element as it is a proven state aid measure. In any case, the Commission would point out that it is impossible to predict the outcome of any subsequent investigation of the possible aid measures referred to by the Honourable Member. In this regard, the Commission would reiterate that it may, by virtue of its state aid control powers, order the recovery of any incompatible or illegally granted aid so as to deprive the recipient of any advantage it may have enjoyed over its competitors, thereby restoring the pre-aid competitive market situation.
