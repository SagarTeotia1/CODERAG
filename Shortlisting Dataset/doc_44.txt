Joint answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-6803/10 , E-6804/10 (23 September 2010) The Commission keeps Parliament informed in relation to ongoing infringement procedures currently in accordance with point 36 of the 2005 Framework Agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission. As a general rule, information is provided to Parliament once the Commission issues its reasoned opinion; in certain specific cases earlier, when the letter of formal notice is sent to the Member State. The Commission makes this information systematically available, without the need for any specific request, on the following web page: http://ec.europa.eu/community_law/infringements/infringements_decisions_en.htm Being a public and regularly updated site, this page makes it possible for the Honourable Member to access the information requested. The decisions taken by the Commission are broken down according to years and then each month when the Commission has taken a decision on infringement cases. In respect of monthly decision-taking, infringements are grouped by Member States so that the procedures concerning Malta can be found in the corresponding table. These tables include the number, the responsible service, the title of the case and the latest Commission decision of the infringement in question.
