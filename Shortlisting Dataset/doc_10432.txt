WRITTEN QUESTION E-2006/10 by Daniël van der Stoep (NI) to the Council (6 April 2010) Subject: Case C-133/06 ( Parliament v Council ) and the proposed regulation on the multiannual financial framework How does the Council view Article 8(3) of the proposal for a Council regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2007‑13 in the light of the judgment of 6 May 2008 of the European Court of Justice in Case C‑133/06? More specifically, how does it view the proposal in Article 8(3) that the framework for decision-making should be the budgetary procedure, under which a qualified majority is required in the Council, rather than unanimity, which should strictly speaking be the route taken if the Council endorses the Court’s judgment in Case C‑133/06?
