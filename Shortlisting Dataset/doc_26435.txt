with its eastern and southern neighbours. The EP's resolution of 20 November 2003, based on the Napoletano report ( A5-0378/2003 ), takes a broader view of the concept of "Wider Europe". Its paragraphs 5, 8, 14, in particular 27 and 47, point to a simple criterion: "countries that have had some formal economic, political or cultural relationship with the EU should maintain it after the 5th Enlargement". And its paragraph 27 states: "the EIB should be given a mandate and appropriate resources to extend loans to all of eastern Europe". Amendment 2 RECITAL 4 A (new) (4a) Consideration should be given to including countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia in the lending mandate after the year 2006; Amendment 3 RECITAL 4 B (new) (4a) The necessary preparatory measures should be taken in order to include, as of the next generation of EIB lending mandates to enter into effect on 1 January 2008 at the latest, the following countries: Armenia, Azerbajan, Georgia, Kazaksthan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Justification Following consultation and debate within both the Parliament and Council it is clear that EIB lending activities can be a powerful tool for development and stabilisation also in other regions than are currently covered. Considering also the evolution of the European Neighbourhood policy, the necessary preparations to extend the mandate shall be included.
