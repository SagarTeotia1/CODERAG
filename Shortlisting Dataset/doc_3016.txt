bilateral accords - is worried. In fact, as Colombia and Costa Rica, Ecuador's main competitors in banana exports, have better tariffs, they could easily take over Ecuador's share of the EU market. Although the country will benefit from the Geneva Agreement cuts, by 2020 every tonne of Ecuadorian bananas exported to Europe will have a €39 tariff disadvantage compared to its most serious regional competitors. Moreover, within this climate of uncertainty, big multinational companies such as Chiquita and Dole might abandon Ecuador as their supplier. Conclusions Your Rapporteur considers that the European Parliament should give its consent on the Agreements if it received firm commitments from the Commission and the Council to ensure that: - At the earliest opportunity, an impact assessment on the effects of the agreements on banana‑producing developing countries and the European outmost regions until 2020 will be presented to the European Parliament; - An impact assessment of the BAM, 18 months prior to the programme's expiry will be submitted, to Parliament, accompanied, where necessary, by appropriate proposals; - Specific initiatives are taken to strengthen the commercial position of banana growers within the various supply chains; - There are no attempts to finance the programme for ACP banana-producing countries through redeployment from the budget lines for development cooperation; - The resources from the BAM will be allocated across countries according to the expected losses in terms of banana exports and production along with the country's level of development, weighted indicators and the trade in bananas in the EU. 16.12.2010 OPINION of the Committee on Development for the Committee on International Trade on the draft Council Decision on the conclusion of a Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas between the European Union and Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Venezuela and of an Agreement on Trade in Bananas between the European Union and the United States of America (07782/2010 – C7‑0148/2010 – 2010/0057(NLE) ) Rapporteur: Charles Goerens SHORT JUSTIFICATION The arrangements applicable to the producers of bananas imported into the EU, as laid down in Regulation 404/93/EEC, have been contested by several Latin American members of the WTO and by the United States and are the subject of WTO dispute settlement procedures. The need to eliminate all differences in treatment in line with the WTO rules has resulted in rulings unfavourable to the EU, which for fifteen years has hence been negotiating solutions aimed first at introducing a tariff-only regime and then at reducing the rate of ‘Most Favoured Nation’ (MFN) duty. Negotiations in the WTO resulted, on 15 December 2009, in an agreement on trade in bananas with Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Venezuela and in an agreement on trade in bananas with the United States of America. These agreements, negotiated by the Commission, provide for the settlement of disputes between the countries concerned within the GATT. Furthermore, they implement the Understandings by imposing a ‘tariff-only regime’ and provide for the settlement of all on-going disputes over the tariffs applicable to bananas imported from Latin America.
