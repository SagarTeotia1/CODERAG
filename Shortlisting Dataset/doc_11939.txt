WRITTEN QUESTION E-2593/07 by Ivo Belet (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (22 May 2007) Subject: Bank charges charged to residents and to non-residents in Spain Spanish bank La Caixa has been reported to have been charging foreign customers (those not resident in Spain) significantly higher charges and commission than customers officially resident in Spain. The specific case reported is that of a Belgian citizen, the owner of a company in Spain, who lived in Spain for five years and who, following his move back to Belgium, suddenly found himself required to pay far more in charges and commission on his account and mortgage loan with La Caixa, without having been informed in advance. 1. Is the Commission aware of the existence of such practices in the European banking sector? 2. Does the Commission intend to take steps in the near future to put an end to this form of discrimination?
