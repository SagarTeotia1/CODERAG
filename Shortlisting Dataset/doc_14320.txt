Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2007) The Mountain Hare Lepus timidus is listed in Annex V to Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992 . and Member States therefore need to apply measures to ensure that the taking in the wild of specimens of this species as well as its exploitation is compatible with the species being maintained at a favourable conservation status. Member States are to take such action if they deem it necessary in light of surveillance of its conservation status. With regard to the situation of the Mountain Hare in Scotland it is the responsibility of the relevant United Kingdom authorities, in light of the outcome of surveillance and having regard to any serious threats posed by exploitation, to take the appropriate measures in accordance with Article 14 of the directive.
