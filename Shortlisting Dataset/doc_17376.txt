Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (7 June 2011) In presenting the plot of the film project ‘Purosangue’, the Honourable Member underscores the positive and inclusive values of sport, as well as the fact that doping and other negative developments pose a threat to sport and physical activity. The Commission agrees with this assessment. The Commission also agrees that there is a need to encourage the public to practice physical activity in healthy conditions and on the basis of fair play. The Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its answers to Written Questions E‑2970/2011 and E‑1689/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp where information is provided about funding opportunities in the field of sport and about policy initiatives in the area of anti-doping. There is no funding available for the production of short films under the MEDIA programme, the EU's support programme for the European audiovisual industry.
