ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0060/08 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Giles Chichester and Angelika Niebler , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to the Commission Subject: ENISA In November 2007, the Commission presented a proposal to establish a new European authority for telecommunications, known as the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA) , which, among other things, should take over the current responsibilities of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) from 2011 onwards. In parallel, in December 2007, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing ENISA as regards its duration, seeking to extend its mandate for two years until March 2011, to ensure continuity until the entry into force of the EECMA. The following questions should be clarified: Will the Commission's proposal to extend the mandate of ENISA until 2011 still be justified if the EECMA proposal is rejected? Is ENISA capable of continuing to assume its current responsibilities in its current form without EECMA support and in view of the criticisms made in the evaluation report of January 2007 concerning the structure, location and resources of ENISA? Has the Commission seriously considered the possibility of replacing ENISA immediately by other, more appropriate, mechanisms, such as a permanent forum of stakeholders or a network of security organisations? Is it sure that network and information security must necessarily be addressed by means of a European agency, when the ENISA Management Board is not able to justify this? Does the Commission intend to submit a new proposal to extend the scope of ENISA's competences under the new Lisbon Treaty rules on policies such as network and information security, public security, defence and criminal law? Or does it fully agree with the ENISA Management Board's conclusion that the scope of the Agency should not be materially changed? COM(2007)0699 - 2007/0249(COD), 13.11.2007.
