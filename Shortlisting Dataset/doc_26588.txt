Question for written answer E-009948/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (7 November 2011) Subject: Irredentist teachings in Albanian school textbooks Thousands of school pupils in Albania have this year been issued with a new geography textbook teaching them that their national borders extend as far as Etolia-Akarnania. The book specifically states that ‘the north-western part of Greece from Florina to Preveza is Albanian national territory on which the Tsami majority was the victim of brutal “ethnic cleansing” operations by the Greeks’. It goes on to claim that ‘Kosovo, parts of Montenegro and Serbia, half the territory of Fyrom and all of north-western Greece, including the prefectures of Florina, Kastoria, Grevena, Ioannina, Arta, Preveza, Thesprotia and the northern part of Etolia-Akarnania, are Albanian territories’. In view of this: Will the Commission make representations to the Albanian Government with a view to having the irredentist teachings contained in Albanian textbooks corrected and removed from the syllabus by the end of the year?
