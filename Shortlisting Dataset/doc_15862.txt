Welcomes the fact that "cricket diplomacy" led to the holding of a summit in New Delhi between the Indian Prime Minister and the President of Pakistan on 17 April 2005; welcomes the fact that both parties are making progress in consolidating confidence-building measures, through gradual bilateral normalisation which could lead to a political settlement of the dispute in Kashmir; notes with satisfaction that the joint Commission on Trade has been revived and notes that the two countries have agreed to promote the project for building a gas pipeline from Iran to India, passing through Pakistani territory, which would undoubtedly create positive ties between the parties; 17.
