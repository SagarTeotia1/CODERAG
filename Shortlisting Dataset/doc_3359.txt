WRITTEN QUESTION P-1060/06 by Fernando Fernández Martín (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (13 March 2006) Subject: The effect of the implementation of the Venezuelan law on land and agricultural reform on the interests of European citizens Since the promulgation of the ‘law on land and agricultural development’ in Venezuela in November 2001, European citizens of various nationalities (Italian, British, Spanish and Portuguese) have been writing to us claiming that they feel affected by the implementation of the law, particularly since mid‑2005, in all sorts of ways, which do not, according to our informants, always exactly line up. What information does the Commission have as to possible effects which the application of the law in question has had or could have on the interests of Community citizens?
