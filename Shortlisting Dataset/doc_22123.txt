WRITTEN QUESTION E-3894/08 by José Ribeiro e Castro (PPE‑DE) to the Council (11 July 2008) Subject: Cuban delegation mentioned in the Council's decision of 18 June 2007 I wish to come back to my Written Question P‑2988/08, given that the Council did not address the actual subject matter of the question in its answer. My question referred specifically to the Council's decision of 18 June 2007, stating that ‘a Cuban delegation will be invited to Brussels’ to sound out the possibility of resuming ‘a comprehensive and open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities’ and to indicate that ‘the EU will outline to the Cuban Government its views on democracy, universal human rights and fundamental freedoms’. In its answer, the Council made no mention of such an invitation. I do not question the fact that (possibly many) other bilateral meetings may have taken place at various levels, as is the normal diplomatic and political practice. However, my initial question was aimed at establishing whether that particular invitation had been extended to the Cuban Government and whether that particular meeting had taken place. Trusting that the Council will be prepared to answer the questions put to it in a serious and objective manner; I would ask the following: — Was the invitation mentioned in the decision of 18 June 2007 sent out? If so, when? — Was an answer received? If so, when, and what was its content? — If the invitation was rejected, what reasons were given by the other party? If the idea was abandoned, what were the reasons for this? — Did the delegation specifically mentioned in the decision travel to Brussels for the purpose announced by the Council? Who were the members of the delegation? — What did the Brussels meeting with this delegation lead to? What was discussed and what were its results and conclusions?
