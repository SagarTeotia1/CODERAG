its citizens and that continuing farming activity in the EU is key in this regard; draws attention to declining farm incomes in the EU, caused by rising production costs and price volatility, which impact negatively on farmers' ability to maintain production; highlights the costs that European farmers have to bear in meeting the highest food safety, environmental, animal welfare and labour standards in the world; stresses that farmers must be compensated for these additional costs and for providing public goods to society; Challenges of climate change 5. Is conscious of the great challenge climate change poses to achieving food security, especially through an increase in the frequency and scale of climatic events, such as droughts, floods, fires and storms, which will diminish the natural resource and agricultural production yields; is concerned about the unilateral actions taken by countries or regions impacted by climatic events and the knock-on effects of such measures on world markets; calls on the Commission to closely monitor implementation of climate change-related legislation in Member States; stresses the urgent need for climate change mitigation actions and adaptation measures aiming at increasing environmental and economic sustainability; urges Member States to set up adequate risk prevention and management measures to limit negative consequences of natural disasters for agricultural production; 6. Calls for coordinated action and better cooperation on climate change between the EU and developing countries, particularly technology transfer and capacity building; emphasises that combating climate change must be mainstreamed into all relevant EU policies, including development cooperation, and that training should focus on climate adaptation and good land stewardship practices, such as soil and water management, to prevent the loss of farmland due to soil erosion or salinisation; Improved development aid 7. Points out that agriculture is a key sector in most developing countries, heavily dependent on primary commodities, which are particularly vulnerable to price fluctuations; 8. Calls on the EU to support rural development, increasing investment in farming and food security, and taking particular account of urgent hunger needs, small-scale farming and social protection programmes; highlights the importance of developing agriculture in the developing world and of allocating an appropriate share of EU overseas development aid to the agriculture sector; regrets that there has been a dramatic reduction in the level of development aid allocated to agriculture since the 1980s and welcomes the recognition of the need to reverse this trend; 9. Calls on the Commission to prioritise agriculture in targeted, accountable, effective and transparently managed development aid, including assistance to farmers in accessing markets; calls for significant increases in the amount of development aid going to agriculture, and for investment in training, improved extension services and decentralised research in agriculture for developing countries, so that farmers will be equipped with sustainable techniques to produce more efficiently while protecting their environment to ensure long-term food security, assisted by adequate public support, such as access to loans, non-profit micro-credit and seeds; 10. Calls on the EU and developing countries to promote land ownership as a tool for reducing poverty and guaranteeing food security, by strengthening property rights and facilitating access
