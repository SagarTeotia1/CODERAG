Reply (30 April 2007) The Council would remind the Honourable Member that, under Article 48 of the EU Treaty, amendments to the Treaties are determined by common accord of a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States. The amendments shall enter into force after being ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. It is not for the Council to take a position on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which was signed in Rome on 29 October 2004 by the Member States of the European Union, nor to comment on positions taken by the Member States with regard to the ratification process.
