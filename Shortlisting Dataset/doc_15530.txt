Amendment 3832 : budget line 06 05 02 : Nuclear Safety Justification for placing 30% of appropriations in reserve and conditions for release: In its Annual Activity Report 2005, referred to in the Synthesis Report of the Commission (COM(2006)277final), DG TREN expresses a reservation concerning nuclear safety due to a lack of sufficient means in terms of legal instruments and staffing in order to evaluate the level of nuclear safety of the nuclear power stations in the enlarged European Union - the Commission risks not being in a position to ensure the application of high safety standards in the field of nuclear energy. The adoption of the relevant legislative instruments ("Nuclear Package") is a priority action needed in order to give the Commission the necessary legal instruments for ensuring a sufficient level of control. Appropriations should be placed in reserve until the Commission addresses these weaknesses. Before Parliament's second reading, the Commission should confirm that it has been granted sufficient specialised staff in order to be in a position to evaluate the level of nuclear safety of the nuclear power stations in the enlarged European Union.
