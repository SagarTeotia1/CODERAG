Question for written answer E-000970/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Graham Watson (ALDE) (9 February 2011) Subject: High Level Expert Group on the Dairy Sector In June 2010, the findings of the High Level Expert Group (HLG) on the dairy sector were announced. Following the announcement, the Commission had planned to introduce legislation by the end of 2010; however, no legislation has been published as yet. When will this legislation be announced, and will it include a clear enhancement of powers so that milk suppliers can negotiate with retailers on a level playing field and receive a fairer price for their produce?
