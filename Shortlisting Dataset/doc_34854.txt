Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (9 November 2011) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Questions E‑007985/2011 and E‑008086/2011 . To further increase the security of the Internet to boost the confidence of EU and at the same time non-EU web surfers, the Commission is working on a comprehensive European Internet Security Strategy. Additionally, to address human rights issues for non‑EU websurfers, the Commission is assessing the possibility of introducing controls on non-listed items like technologies related to Internet security on Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 OJ L 134, 29.5.2009. , which could prove to be an efficient measure. The Commission is also looking at possible tools and instruments which could allow citizens to circumvent arbitrary actions by repressive regimes as it was the case in North Africa when fundamental freedoms were violated.
