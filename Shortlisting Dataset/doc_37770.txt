28 October 2003 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION pursuant to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure by Roberta Angelilli on the political responsibility of the Commission with regard to the management of Eurostat contracts Motion for a European Parliament resolution on the political responsibility of the Commission with regard to the management of Eurostat contracts The European Parliament, – whereas the irregularities at Eurostat are all the more serious in view of its role as supervisory body for the Stability Pact, in that it indirectly guides the economic and tax policies of the Member States, – whereas, although it is yet to be established who is responsible, recent revelations undermine the authority and reliability required of Eurostat under Article 285 of the EC Treaty, as well as the diligence and credibility of the management by the Commissioners responsible, – having regard to Rule 48 of its Rules of Procedure, A. whereas in respect of the only precedent in the history of the Union – the crisis of the Santer Commission – suspected irregularities led to the resignation of the President and the entire College of Commissioners, despite the fact that no direct involvement had been ascertained, but merely because the honourableness and image of the institution had been called into question, B. whereas the Treaty now confers on the President of the Commission suitable instruments with which to take action in similar situations, empowering him to replace Commissioners, C. whereas the entire affair has been handled by the Commission with inexplicable secrecy and, regardless of the transparency on which administrative reform is based, the information that has been made public is scant, piecemeal and conflicting, 1. Calls on the Commission to accept its political responsibilities with regard to the above matters, to take action against those involved (including commissioners, if necessary) and to discuss the issue publicly in order to clarify it, also for public opinion.
