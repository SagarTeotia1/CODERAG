March II session in Brussels. In the Chair: Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL, SV) Procedure: co-decision, first reading With the Lisbon Treaty, in force as of 1 December 2009, the European Parliament has important new lawmaking powers. Virtually all EU legislation is now decided by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers together - including agriculture, immigration, energy and the EU budget. As the only directly elected EU institution, Parliament's position in making sure the EU is accountable to its citizens is also strengthened, for example by MEPs having a bigger say in appointments to many of the EU's top jobs. 20091130IPR65557 Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality Draft report Profile of Rapporteur Edite ESTRELA (S&D, PT) EN 1 LINK /activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=FEMM EN 2 LINK /meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/femm/pr/795/795288/795288en.pdf EN 3 LINK /members/expert/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&id=28310 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
