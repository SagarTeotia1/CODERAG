Reply (1 September 2006) The Council is following recent developments in Somalia closely and with deep concern. The Council has on many occasions expressed its support for peace and reconciliation in Somalia and the rebuilding of a functional state, building on the results of the Somali National Reconciliation Conference. In line with this, the EU supports the Somali transitional federal institutions (TFIs) as the only legitimate framework for national dialogue and reconciliation, the restoration of stable governance and reconstruction, to be based on the Somali Transitional Federal Charter and the principles of consensus and inclusiveness. Similarly, the EU considers that the promotion and protection of human rights, the restoration of the rule of law, democracy and good governance in Somalia, is the only effective way to achieve security and stability and to provide social and economic recovery in the country. In the present situation, the EU, in line with the rest of the international community, urges the Somali parties to establish a dialogue with a view to reach consensus within the framework of the TFIs. In this respect, the EU has welcomed the agreement reached in Khartoum, on 22 June 2006, between the TFIs and the Union of Islamic Courts establishing a basis for negotiations, and has urged the two parties to honour the commitments stipulated in the agreement. On 14 July 2006, the EU has expressed its concerns for the continuing tension in Somalia and has condemned recent fighting in Mogadishu. It urged all parties, within and outside Somalia, to refrain from action that might provoke further violence or confrontation and to comply with the UN arms embargo on Somalia. The EU expressed its support to the efforts of the League of Arab States to facilitate dialogue between the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and the Union of Islamic Courts. The Council has not specifically addressed the issue of the desecrated Italian cemetery in Mogadishu.
