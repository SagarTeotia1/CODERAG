WRITTEN QUESTION P-1834/10 by Małgorzata Handzlik (PPE) to the Commission (18 March 2010) Subject: Evaluation and authorisation of nutritional and health claims by the EFSA Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9. , which concerns foods and food supplements, is intended to standardise nutritional and health claims made on product labels or in advertising. However, Article 13 of this regulation, which deals with generic health claims, and in particular irregularities in the EFSA's evaluation and authorisation of such claims, raises a number of doubts. Does the Commission consider that the process for the authorisation of generic claims under Article 13 is sufficiently transparent, especially in the light of the following: — the unclear requirements set by the EFSA when applications were first lodged in 2007, — the lack of any clear requirement for human testing to be carried out, which has resulted in the rejection of 39 000 applications, — changing of requirements during the claims declaration process, — the evaluation of generic claims in the same way as other health claims, in breach of the preamble to the regulation, which clearly stipulates that a separate evaluation and authorisation process is required, — publication of EFSA opinions in batches (the EFSA says it would need a further two years to evaluate all pending applications), which poses a threat to market competition, creating a situation in which a company which has had its claims accepted first can then gain a market advantage? In the light of the doubts surrounding claims under Article 13, what steps will the Commission take to assist SME which either cannot afford to invest in the research or testing needed to meet EFSA criteria or have only had their claims authorised belatedly? Does it envisage any scope for dialogue with companies whose claims have been rejected by the EFSA?
