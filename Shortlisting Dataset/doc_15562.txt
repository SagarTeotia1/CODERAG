cases resulted in certain Member States; 23. Urges the European Commission and Council to provide for sufficient means for research into and the provision of vaccines against animal diseases, especially given the arrival of previously unknown virus types in the Union; 24. Calls for an increase in appropriations with a view to stepping up controls on imported produce aimed at checking whether it complies with all the Union's production conditions and is correctly labelled, in particular with a view to informing consumers of its origins; 25. Underlines the important role the agricultural sector can play in the conservation of traditional landscapes and the environment and in the provision of renewable energy; therefore urges the Commission and Council to support the initiation of a pilot project exploring the measures to be taken to improve the energy efficiency of the agricultural and horticultural sector; 26. Deplores the current suspension of the World Trade Organization negotiations; regrets also the fact that the Union has so far been unable to make any progress in acknowledgement of the Non-Trade Concerns as described in the mandate given to the Commission by the European Council; notes that acknowledgement of the Non-Trade Concerns could mean a considerable saving on the agricultural budget in future, in so far as the payment of compensation in connection with certain Community legislation would become unnecessary.
