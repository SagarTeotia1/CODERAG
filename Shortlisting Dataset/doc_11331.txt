WRITTEN QUESTION P-2992/08 by Christofer Fjellner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (22 May 2008) Subject: ‘European Maritime Day’ and the common fisheries policy ‘European Maritime Day’ will be celebrated 20 May, as announced by the Commission on a gigantic banner covering the Berlaymont facade. The day is being celebrated in the shadow of ongoing industrial-scale overfishing in the world's oceans, overfishing caused to large extent by EU fishing agreements with some of the world's poorest nations and by EU subsidies to the European fishing industry. None of the activities organised in connection with ‘European Maritime Day’ seem to deal with the precarious state of our seas. What does the Commission intend to do to stop overfishing in time for next year's celebration of ‘European Maritime Day’?
