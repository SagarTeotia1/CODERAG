Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (16 January 2007) The Commission, in its meetings with the Israeli authorities, has reminded them on a number of occasions of Israel’s obligations under international law. Notwithstanding real security risks, this means avoiding disproportionate military action, including attacks on civilian targets. As with all Euromediterranean partners, the Association Agreement with Israel establishes the framework for political dialogue. The Commission considers it vital, particularly in a crisis, to keep all channels of diplomatic and political contact open. Suspending the Association Agreement would not necessarily make the Israeli authorities more responsive to EU concerns. It is the Commission’s view (which reflects the views of the EU Foreign Ministers) that positive persuasion and dialogue on respect for international and humanitarian law through the means provided by the legal treaties with Israel is a more effective approach to conveying EU views on issues such as those raised by the Honourable Member. However, any decision on possible measures with regard to the EU‑Israel Association Agreement ultimately is to be taken in accordance with the provisions in Article 79 of the Agreement.
