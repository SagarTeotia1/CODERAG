Question for written answer E-8458/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) and Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (13 October 2010) Subject: European Drought Observatory In the plenary sitting of 21 September 2010, Parliament called for more effective aid in the event of natural disasters in the EU’s outermost regions, in the wake of the report by Joao Ferreira, MEP, on the Commission communication: A Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters. It was proposed that accelerated payments from the EU Solidarity Fund should be made in the event of disasters such as fires. Parliament called on the Commission to submit legislative proposals on forestry protection and fire prevention and adopt an EU policy on water scarcity, drought and adaptation to climate change. Parliament then renewed its call for the establishment of the European Drought Observatory which would be responsible for studying, mitigating and monitoring the effects of droughts. The setting-up of the observatory was agreed in a non-binding resolution in March 2009, in which the Members announced that it would be a department of the European Environment Agency, based in Copenhagen. Some of the main arguments put forward were that, in addition to fires, droughts caused desertification and salinisation, reduced biodiversity and placed growing pressure on agricultural land, leading to its deterioration, especially in southern Europe. What steps has the Commission taken to establish the European Drought Observatory? Has the Commission considered situating the observatory in the Canary Islands, which, like other outermost regions, would be, with its unique geography and geology, a perfect laboratory in which to conduct research in many fields, including climate change?
