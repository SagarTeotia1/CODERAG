Question for written answer E-003786/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Giovanni Collino (PPE) (15 April 2011) Subject: Risk levels with regard to nuclear energy in Spain The nuclear disaster in Japan is reviving the controversy surrounding nuclear energy strategies in all countries of the world, including the EU Member States and the European Union itself, the principal cause for concern being nuclear safety, given that we cannot afford any recurrence of a nuclear disaster of Chernobyl proportions or even worse. While in Japan experts are sparing no effort to avoid the worst, the principal European countries have announced the adoption of measures to assess their own plant safety levels and where necessary intervene to contain or actually eliminate the risk. Germany in particular has decided to dismantle seven of its 30-year old reactors while political discussions are being held regarding what other measures to take. In view of this: what measures does the Commission intend to take, given that Spain is still using reactors of the type being decommissioned in Germany and that, for the moment at least, it is showing no signs of doing anything to avert the nuclear risk?
