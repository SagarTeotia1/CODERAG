WRITTEN QUESTION E-3233/07 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (25 June 2007) Subject: Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions in Europe. A most important causative factor for the disease is the intake of refined sugar. Experience gained from tobacco and alcohol use reduction campaigns shows clearly that the most effective way to achieve beneficial results is through increasing the tax and therefore the price of these products. Does the Commission share in my view that, a high tax on refined sugar could result in a welcome reduction in sugar intake by our citizens and consequently a beneficial prevention measure of type 2 diabetes in Europe? If so, what steps is the Commission planning to take in this direction?
