WRITTEN QUESTION P-2366/08 by Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 April 2008) Subject: EU imposition of joint tuition fees in education The Commission is attempting to impose a joint tuition fee for all students participating in the Erasmus Mundus programmes. The exact wording goes: j) shall establish a joint tuition fee regardless of the actual place of study of the students within the master’s programme (Annex part A for the purpose of the Erasmus Mundus programmes). Considering that education — and in particular the model of financing in education — is a Member State competence, I was quite disturbed to find out about the Commission’s proposal. Firstly, whether or not Member States privatise the tuition fees for master’s programmes is not a matter for the EU. Sweden has democratically decided to fund master’s programmes publicly, and we have no intention of changing that. Secondly, I find it rather awkward to put such an essential aspect of a proposal in an annex. It is clearly not a good example of transparency to proceed in such a way. I request an explanation of the Commission’s privatisation drive in higher education. On what legal basis or on what basis at all can the Commission justify its proposal?
