WRITTEN QUESTION E-5828/09 by Nuno Melo (PPE) to the Commission (24 November 2009) Subject: Excess of foreigners at job centres in Portugal The Lisbon Treaty confirms and strengthens the European Union's commitment to develop a common immigration policy. In fact, immigration policy must be linked to each country's ability to humanely receive and integrate those who choose it as a destination. This humane approach to integration entails a highly stringent approach to entry. According to data published by the Portuguese Institute of Employment and Vocational Training, the number of foreigners registered as unemployed at job centres in Portugal has risen by 65 % over the same period in 2008 (20 777, against 12 371 in 2008). It might be pointed out that 34.1 % of these unemployed people do not receive any social security support. 1. Does the Commission believe that these figures are the result of errors in ‘open-door’ immigration policies which, because they are not stringent in relation to entry, do not then allow the proper humane integration of immigrant citizens? 2. What steps does the Commission recommend in order to reverse this trend? 3. What measures have been jointly considered or decided by all the EU countries?
