Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (5 March 2012) An initiative on Bank Recovery and Resolution is currently being prepared by the Commission services. The new framework should have a broad scope of application. Its objective will be to equip authorities with a wide range of common and effective powers to deal with banking crises at an early stage and to avoid, as far as possible, the use of taxpayers' money to rescue banks. The Commission is analyzing the feasibility that the framework includes: — early supervisory intervention to indentify and address developing problems in banking institutions; — preparatory measures, including a requirement for recovery and resolution plans (‘living wills’) for all banks to ensure that the banks have in place realistic plans and arrangements to deal with financial stress, and authorities have analyzed how the institutions could be resolved if failure is inevitable with minimum systemic impact; — harmonised resolution tools and powers to ensure that national authorities have a common toolkit to manage the failure of banks; — a framework for cooperation and coordination between national authorities in planning for and carrying out resolution of cross-border banking groups; this will include a framework for cooperation also with third countries; — funding arrangements which aim to ensure that the cost of bank resolution is borne by the bank sector itself.
