Question for written answer E-000412/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Frieda Brepoels (Verts/ALE) (27 January 2011) Subject: Election observation missions and the selection of candidates EU election observation missions are an important way of building up trust in a country’s democracy. They are used on the basis of the EU’s commitment to democracy and human rights and with a view to promoting respect for the rule of law. In this context, I have several questions for the Commission. What is the procedure for being appointed to observation missions? Should people put themselves forward as candidates? If so, how does this happen? Does the Commission publish an election rota? What role is played by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the applicant’s country? Does the Ministry draw up a list with names for the Commission? How does the Commission make the final selection of candidates? What criteria are used? Is there equality between men and women on the lists of nominees and in the final choice? What happens with nominations from countries with several official languages? — Is there a general list where nominees from the various language groups are mixed together? Or does the Commission choose from separate lists by language group? — Are there always an equal number of nominees from the various language groups? If not, why not? — Does the Commission respect the language balance of the country in question in the final choice of candidates? Does the Commission choose an equal number of candidates from the various language groups? If not, why not? In short, how does the Commission make its choice and for what reasons?
