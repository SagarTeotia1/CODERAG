is sufficient mutual confidence, cooperation will not work properly. At the same time, Bulgaria and Romania participate in the core instruments that regulate cross-border information exchange. Romania and Bulgaria are two of ten Member States that have already been authorised to exchange DNA reference profiles on the basis of the Prüm Decisions Council Decisions 2008/615/JHA and 2008/616/JHA. , while the other 17, including many that have been Members for decades, are not yet in a place to exchange electronic data on the basis of this instrument. Moreover, both countries have fully implemented the so-called ‘Swedish initiative’ Council Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA. , which regulates the cross-border exchange of criminal intelligence and information, while many ‘older’ Member States have not yet done so. The participation in these two instruments indicates that both Romania and Bulgaria take their obligations stemming from EU membership seriously.
