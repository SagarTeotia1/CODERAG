science, NGOs, institutes, Member States and third countries at EU, regional, national and local level) and consider actions with regard to change in design and production, increased prevention and reduced use, education and awareness raising, research and monitoring, strengthening existing policies and stimulate remediation activities. The Commission is now assessing options for measures at EU level to reduce the use of plastic carrier bags. Options could be a total ban of plastic carrier bags, the use of special pricing methods, use of biodegradable plastic and others. The Commission, together with the JRC, is also preparing setting up end of waste criteria for plastic waste under Article 6 of the Directive on Waste OJ L 312, 22.11.2008. . Such criteria setting standards of equivalency between virgin material and recycled material are expected to be a strong stimulus for industry to attune plastic production to achieving high recycling rates. By 2015, as an obligation under the MSFD the Member States will report on the measures they intend to take to reduce or prevent marine litter. Measures are already being implemented in some Member States. An example of good practice has come from Ireland, which has introduced levies on plastic bags. With the advent of the Directive on Waste to be transposed into national law as of 12 December 2010 a strong stimulus was also created to bring Europe closer to a recycling society. For a number of years now, the Commission has carried out awareness-raising campaigns in all Member States on waste management including recycling. The present campaign concentrates on the implementation of the Directive on Waste and its environmental objectives.
