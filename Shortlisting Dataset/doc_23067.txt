Question for written answer E-004275/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ashley Fox (ECR) (4 May 2011) Subject: Implementation of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats In part of my constituency, Kingston Seymour, in North Somerset, Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats is being used to justify plans by the UK’s Environment Agency to move the historic sea defences one mile further inland in order to create a salt marsh habitat. This will bring the sea defences significantly closer to 37000 houses and will threaten the livelihoods of farmers and residents in the area. Has the Commission considered the impact of this Directive on local communities which do not want habitats such as salt marshes created on their land? What action will the Commission take when the implementing bodies of Member States apply EU directives in a way which seriously harms local communities? What action will the Commission take in relation to the UK Environment Agency’s proposals regarding the sea defences in Kingston Seymour?
