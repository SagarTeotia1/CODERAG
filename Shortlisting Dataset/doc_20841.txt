Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (21 May 2007) 1. The Commission refers to the reply already provided by the Commission to the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑1600/07 on the same subject. The organism to be established in Badajoz is the Technical Secretariat for the cross-border territorial cooperation programme Spain-Portugal 2007‑13. The attributions of the Secretariat are indicated in Article 14.1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999, OJ L 210, 31.7.2006 on the European Regional Development Fund. The Secretariat will not directly manage any Community Funds, this is the competence of the programme authorities and monitoring committee. Its functions are purely administrative and its functioning costs will be paid by the technical assistance budget of the programme on the basis of validated declared expenditure. No funds are assigned explicitly to the Secretariat. 2. The Commission does not have any official information regarding the organism to be established in Vigo, though it seems to be the coordinating organism for the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) the regions of Galicia and Norte de Portugal are planning to establish in order to develop common cooperation projects, not necessarily only within the cross-border territorial cooperation programme Spain-Portugal 2007‑13. The Commission is not informed, neither needs to be, of the remit of such an organism, which organisation and financing are the exclusive competence of the regions involved. In principle such an organism will not directly manage any Community Funds, nevertheless, the programme might delegate to such an organism some of the responsibilities ascribed to the territorial entity in charge of coordinating cooperation activities between the two regions in the context of the cross-border territorial cooperation programme Spain-Portugal 2007‑13.
