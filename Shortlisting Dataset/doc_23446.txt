after the fact under criminal law, particularly for the illegal dumping of hazardous waste in the territory of other countries; Environment incentives and reform of environmentally harmful subsidies 23. Welcomes the Commission's green paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes; believes that wider use of market-based instruments, taking the environmental impact of all production and distribution processes and consumption patterns into consideration, is needed; 24. Is of the opinion that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has so far not led to reductions in CO2 emissions because of the overly generous allocation of emission allowances; points out that the EU has committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by at least 20% by 2020; insists that the EU ETS for the post-2012 period should include a sufficiently stringent cap, full auctioning and a quantitative and qualitative limit of the use of certified emission reductions (CERs) and emission reduction units (ERUs); 25. Nevertheless, notes that the role of eco-taxation remains modest and does not show an increasing trend; calls on the Commission and the Member States to devote more effort to ecological tax reform including a gradual shift of the tax burden from welfare-negative taxes (e.g. on labour) towards welfare-positive taxes, (e.g. on environmentally damaging activities, such as resource use or pollution); points out that, despite the unanimity requirement in the area of taxation, the treaties offer the possibility of enhanced cooperation, and draws attention to the existence of the open coordination method; 26. Notes the impetus that has been given to removing environmentally harmful subsidies; however, finds it unacceptable that no concrete steps towards the reform of environmentally harmful subsidies are expected in the near future, and therefore calls on the Commission to put forward concrete proposals by the end of 2008 to phase out gradually all environmentally harmful subsidies over the next five years; Environmental policy integration, international cooperation and incentives for innovation 27. Urges the Commission and the Member States to promote stronger and more coherent environmental policy integration in all EU policy-making; with the aim of implementing the 'health in all policies' approach which has been proclaimed in the European Union, calls for integration of environmental protection and health protection aspects into all policies and also to involve regions and towns in this; regrets both the lack of integration of these aspects in various environmental legal frameworks and the preparations for new legislation and the lack of their integration into legislation which has primary objectives other than environmental protection; 28. Considers that, in order to achieve concrete results in the integration of environmental considerations in other economic sectors, there is a need to draw up binding sectoral targets and timetables; at the same time, stresses the responsibility of economic actors in individual sectors of industry for achieving long-term results in terms of climate and energy policy; 29. Emphasises the fundamental link between an efficient environmental policy and improved quality of life and, in this connection, highlights the importance of the regional dimension in the implementation of the Sixth EAP, especially in actions
