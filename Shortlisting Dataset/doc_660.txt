Question for written answer E-010330/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Matteo Salvini (EFD) (14 November 2011) Subject: Transport in Sardinia La Maddalena is the largest island of the archipelago of the same name. Located north-east of Sardinia, opposite the Costa Smeralda tourist resort, it is one of the most interesting areas in our country. Daytime shipping links between Palau and La Maddalena are provided by the public company Saremar (owned by the Sardinia Region [RAS]) and by the private company Enermar, while for the night service, in 2004 the RAS offered the contract to a company called Delcomar, without issuing any invitation to tender. This procedure was challenged before the Regional Administrative Court, which declared it illegal. Following the ruling, in 2011 the RAS issued a call for tenders for the award of the night-time public service contract, in which the requirements appeared to be to the advantage of the company that had already been offered the contract — Delcomar. The court subsequently ordered that Enermar's exclusion from the bid was to be suspended, but in actual fact the company was not reinstated as a competitor. A few days ago the company thus announced that it would no longer be providing a shipping service between Palau and La Maddalena and that it would have to lay off 83 employees. Does the Commission believe that the behaviour of the Sardinia Region is in compliance with Community legislation on competition and transparency in public procurement? Does it not agree that such behaviour is detrimental to the free market, price competition and consumer protection (in this case the consumers being both islanders and the numerous tourists who visit the island)?
