the deepening of EU-Mexico relations can help enhance the consensus between the EU and its Latin American partners on regional and global issues, facilitating the joint promotion of their shared interests and values in international and regional forums, L. whereas the Strategic Partnership needs to be conceived as marking a qualitative leap in EU-Mexico relations, at two different levels: multilaterally, in terms of mutual coordination on issues of world importance; and bilaterally, via the development of their relations and of particular initiatives; M. whereas the processes of political and economic integration, the increasing spread of economic globalisation and the importance of the debate on democracy, human rights and the environment, inter alia, have changed the priorities in the agenda of both regions, N. whereas Mexico's strategic situation and its network of trade agreements mean that this country is of great strategic importance for European exports, the EU being its second source of foreign investment, O. whereas the Mexico-EU Free Trade Area (FTA) plays an important role in the EU's bilateral relations since its scope is very comprehensive (covering goods, services, procurement, competition, intellectual property rights, investment and related payments), P. whereas Mexican emigration to the EU, inter alia, is one of the most important and sensitive issues for Mexico, given the high number of Mexican immigrants, many of them highly skilled, in the Union, 1. Makes the following recommendations to the Council: (a) hopes that the Strategic Partnership will mark a qualitative leap in EU-Mexico relations, both multilaterally in terms of issues of world importance and in strengthening the development of bilateral relations; (b) favours institutionalising annual EU-Mexico summits within the framework of the Strategic Partnership, as is already the case for those with the US, Russia, China and Brazil; (c) trusts that the Strategic Partnership will give a new impetus to the EU-Mexico Global Agreement in its various aspects - political (including human rights), security, anti-drugs trafficking, environmental, cooperation (technical and cultural) and socio-economic; (d) wishes the trade chapter to be based on like-for-like treatment, solidarity, dialogue and respect for the specific characteristics of Mexico and the EU; (e) reiterates its support for the Mexican Government and President Calderón in their vital work of cleaning up certain institutions of the state; believes this campaign is essential in order to stop corruption and ensure that society is not left unprotected; (f) believes that it falls within the sphere of its activities to fight feminicide in both regions, on a basis of dialogue, cooperation and the exchange of best practices; (g) trusts that the Strategic Partnership will lead to closer coordination of positions on crisis situations and issues of world importance, on the basis of shared interests and concerns; (h) wishes to see clear guidelines on how best to ensure close cooperation with a view to promoting effective multilateralism and reinforcing the UN's capacities for preserving and consolidating peace and ensuring respect for human rights, while also tackling, in the framework of international law, common threats to peace and security such as trafficking in drugs and arms, organised crime, terrorism and human trafficking,
