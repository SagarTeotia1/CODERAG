Joint answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-6629/07 , E-0171/08 (13 February 2008) The Lisbon Treaty confirms the gradual evolution of health in the EU and develops further the health policy as was done by the Maastricht Treaty in 1994 and by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999, resulting in the current Article 152. The new Article on public health can be seen as a reinforcement of health, although it does not extend the legislative powers at EU level. The new wording will enable the EU to set standards for medical products and devices on the basis of the public health Article. This new Article specifies how coordination between Member States can be promoted, including through the establishment of guidelines and indicators. It also introduces the explicit possibility of taking incentive measures combating serious cross-border health scourges and concerning tobacco and abuse of alcohol. The reference to encouraged cooperation on health services will maintain the potential for European action in this field. The new Article on public health will enable the legislators to continue to adopt measures benefiting EU citizens. Measures have already been adopted, based on the current Article 152, to ensure a high quality and safety for blood, tissues and cells. This is of great benefit for patients and citizens moving across the borders. The establishment of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community have increased EU citizens' protection from communicable diseases. The new Health Programme 2008‑13 will provide an important tool for strengthening the knowledge and providing health gains in the EU. In addition to this, a number of recommendations, including those on tobacco, alcohol and cancer screening, have been adopted on the basis of the current Article.
