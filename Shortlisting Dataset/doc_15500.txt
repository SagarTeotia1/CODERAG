difficult given nomenclature that has changed frequently over recent years. Moreover, six budget lines/ activities under title 18 have changed name see Annex VI to document SEC(2006)231, document II, point 4.6, p. 100 between the budget 2006 and the 2007 preliminary draft budget (PDB). 2. Heading 3 in the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2007 - 2013 is now called "Citizenship, Freedom, Security and Justice", but internal/ home affairs issues are, for the first time, covered by a newly established sub-heading "Freedom, Security and Justice": Heading 3a. "Citizenship" is covered under heading 3b. Having "ring fenced" for the first time the amounts allocated to "Justice, Freedom and Security" in a specific subheading in the MFF marks the priority given to it compared to the period 2000 - 2006 and ensures increased visibility and a stable financial basis to its policies as the Commission can not easily reshuffle its budget to other policy areas. The responsible Commissioner, Vice-President Frattini, has the portfolio "Justice, Freedom and Security". This is also the name of the relevant Commission Directorate-General, which was named "Justice and Home affairs" until August 2004 Somewhat confusingly, this Commission DG is sometimes referred to by the abbreviation of DG JLS. . 3. This working document will therefore concentrate on Title 18. It will not analyse amounts dedicated to issues such as the "security research" in the 7th Framework Research Programme under part "Co-operation" a budget line 02 04 01 called "Security and Space Research" gets underway in 2007 with EUR 171,7 million in commitment appropriations (mentioned in Subheading 1a). It also does not analyse expenditure falling under subheading 3b "Citizenship" which covers the communication of EU policies to citizens of the European Union. Challenges Overall resources within Heading 3a 4. As the European Parliament in its resolution on the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy report (APS) stated European Parliament resolution of 18 May 2006 on the 2007 budget: the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy report (APS), P6_TA-PROV(2006)0221 : "European citizens need security in their everyday lives" and "in the face of modern, globalized crime, concerted EU action is a necessary component of policies to ensure a safe society founded on the rule of law" point 22 and 23 of the APS resolution . In terms of the overall resources to tackles policy challenges in this area, in its Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB), the Commission states an increase of 5,24 % between the figures for 2007 (EUR 619 million) and 2006 (EUR 588,2 million) SEC(2006)231, document II, point 3.18, p.54 . Looking at the corresponding table in the Budget 2006 OJ L 78 of 15 March 2006, p. 935 , EUR 590,4 million had been allocated by the budgetary authority to Title 18, which would mean an increase of only 4,84 per cent. It is clear that the EUR 619 million appropriation foreseen in the PDB contains administrative as well as operational expenditure. As regards operational expenditure in Title 18, according to the Commission's PDB, this totals EUR 571,3 million. This implies EUR 47,7 million for administrative expenditure. Unfortunately, this does not correspond to line 18
