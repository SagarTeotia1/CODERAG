Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (14 November 2011) Since the granting of visa-free travel in December 2009, several Member States have been confronted with a substantial influx of unfounded asylum applications lodged by citizens of several Western Balkan countries. Detailed figures in this respect are presented in a table which is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. The Commission attaches great importance to the visa liberalisation process and is concerned by the negative trend in asylum applications. It established a monitoring mechanism that provides necessary tools to monitor both the continuous implementation of the visa dialogue benchmarks and the migration flows between the Western Balkan countries and the EU Member States. In May 2011 the first Commission staff working paper on the post-visa liberalisation monitoring for the Western Balkan countries was presented to the Parliament and the Council http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10997.en11.pdf . A further such paper will be presented in December 2011. At the EU‑Western Balkans JHA Ministerial Forum in Ohrid (3-4 October), I called again on the Ministers from the Western Balkan countries to take decisive action to counteract the situation with the unfounded asylum applications. I stressed the need for decisive steps for the better integration of minorities (including Roma, as the majority of asylum‑seekers from the visa-exempted Balkan countries originate from the Roma minority). A follow-up meeting of Senior Officials of the Western Balkan countries, the most concerned EU Member States, the Commission, Frontex and Europol was held in Brussels on 5 October 2011. The Western Balkan partners were asked to update the Commission on measures introduced or planned. This information will be part of the basis for the next Commission staff working paper mentioned above.
