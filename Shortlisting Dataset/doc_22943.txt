plum pudding or just \"pud\", though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit.", " Despite the name \"plum pudding,\" the pudding contains no actual plums due to the pre-Victorian use of the word \"plums\" as a term for raisins.", " The pudding is composed of many dried fruits held together by egg and suet, sometimes moistened by treacle or molasses and flavoured with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and other spices.", " The pudding is usually aged for a month or more, or even a year; the high alcohol content of the pudding prevents it from spoiling during this time." ] ], [ "Thomson problem", [ "The objective of the Thomson problem is to determine the minimum electrostatic potential energy configuration of \"N\" electrons constrained to the surface of a unit sphere that repel each other with a force given by Coulomb's law.", " The physicist J. J. Thomson posed the problem in 1904 after proposing an atomic model, later called the plum pudding model, based on his knowledge of the existence of negatively charged electrons within neutrally-charged atoms." ] ], [ "Plum pudding model", [ "The plum pudding model is one of several scientific models of the atom.", " First proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1904 soon after the discovery of the electron, but before the discovery of the atomic nucleus, the model represented an attempt to consolidate the known properties of atoms at the time: 1) electrons are negatively-charged particles and 2) atoms are neutrally-charged." ] ], [ "Aage Bohr", [ "Aage Niels Bohr (] ; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009) was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\".", " Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments.", " Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics." ] ], [ "J. J. Thomson", [ "Sir Joseph John Thomson {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} ( ; 18 December 1856 – 30 August 1940) was an English physicist and Nobel laureate in physics, credited with the discovery and identification of the electron; and with the discovery of the first subatomic particle." ] ], [ "Ada Yonath", [ "Ada E.
