Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (27 November 2008) For the development of the distribution network in the area of Attica, Greece holds a derogation from certain provisions of Directive 2003/55/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas (the ‘Gas Directive’) Directive 2003/55/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 98/30/EC, OJ L 176, 15.7.2003. . The derogation was granted to Greece pursuant to Article 28(8) of the Gas Directive. The derogation concerns the provisions of Articles 4, 12, 13, 18, 23 and or 24 of this directive and is valid for 30 years. This more specifically is related to the exclusive use of distribution networks developed in the geographical area of Attica, and of Thessaloniki and Thessaly. In order to develop the distribution network in the area of Attica, the Greek government conducted an international tender procedure. The outcome to that procedure was the establishment of the Natural Gas Supply Company (EPA) which holds the licence to supply natural gas to households, commercial and small industrial users in the area of Attica. The EPA is a partnership between the Public Natural Gas Company (DEPA) and DukeEnergy — Shell. DEPA holds a 51 % share in the company while the remaining shares are held by DukeEnergy-Shell. The company is managed by DukeEnergy-Shell. The Commission has supported the construction of the gas distribution network in this area by making funds available through the Community Structural Funds. The project ‘Extension of the construction of the low pressure gas network in Attica’ is being co-financed by the Operational Programme (OP) Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship 2000‑06. This project qualifies as a major project under measure 7.1 of this programme which provides support for the introduction of natural gas into the households, the tertiary sector, small industrial customers and the transport sector. The Commission has been made aware of difficulties in the implementation of this project by the Greek authorities both before, and as a result of, the forest fires which occurred in the summer of 2007. Further to a request for information, the Commission was informed by the Greek authorities of a ministerial decision dated 10 September 2008 to reduce the minimum length of the network to be completed by 31 December 2008 from 2 000 km to 1 500 km. As a consequence of that decision, the details of the project, as included in OP Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship, were also changed on 1 October 2008 reflecting the slower than anticipated implementation and reducing the total eligible cost from EUR 140.7 million to EUR 100.4 million. The possibility is open to the Greek authorities to finish this project with national funds, or to apply for co-financing from the structural funds over the period 2007‑13. It may be added that the Gas Directive does not oblige Member States to ensure that all households are supplied with natural gas supply. Therefore, Member State may decide whether or not households will be connected to the natural
