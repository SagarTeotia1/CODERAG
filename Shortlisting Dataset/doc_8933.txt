and democracy and the links with partner countries around the world; 16. Recalls that this agreement has been achieved without jeopardising other EU external policy priorities; regrets, nevertheless, that the Council’s position has forced some reductions against a few lines where , otherwise, reinforcements proposed in the Parliament's first reading could have been maintained; 17. Requests the Commission to follow closely the developments in Ukraine and ensure that sufficient financial means are provided in order to support the further democratisation of the country; 18. Has decided to support a preparatory action to encourage vaccine development and fight serious poverty-related diseases in developing countries and therefore enters EUR 10 million against that budget line; 19. Has decided to maintain a separate budget heading for the fight against drugs and drug addiction in view of the need for special actions and visibility in this field; therefore enters EUR 6 million against article 19 02 11; 20. Asks the Commission, further to the information provided on financing of non-state actors after Parliament's first reading, to provide a report by April 2005 investigating possible changes to the application of Community rules and regulations, with specific reference to: (a) decreasing direct agreements with non-state actors in the external aid domain, among others by reviewing the contribution to international organisations, which may also decrease the visibility of EU aid; (b) lowering the maximum EU contribution to projects carried out by non-state actors compared to the maximum rate of 85% which currently applies, and assuring that the remainder is financed by non-public funds; (c) improving the financial control of non-state actors and coordination between international donors in response to the grave concerns described in the fifth activity report of the European Anti-Fraud Office; Heading 5: Administrative Expenditure 21.

Points out that the 2004 salary adjustment is only 0,7% instead of 2,6% as initially foreseen; considers that the appropriations in 2005 budget must be adjusted to take account of this lower than expected salary adjustment level; has, together with the Council, invited the Commission to submit not later than March 2005 an amending budget containing exclusively reductions of appropriations for administrative expenditure of the institutions resulting from the annual adaptation of the salaries and pensions; 23.

Invites the secretaries-general of the institutions to present the fourth report on trends in heading 5, including an update on the recruitment, by 1 April 2005; Other Sections 25.
