Agreement as amended by Decision 2003/429/EC (OJ L 147, 14.6.2003, p. 25). and in particular points 27 and 30 thereof, – having regard to the outcome of the negotiating meetings with the Council Presidency and the Trialogue of 5 April 2005, – having regard to Rule 45 of its Rules of Procedure, – having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgets ( A6-0090/2005 ), A. whereas the EC Treaty and in particular Article 272 thereof, and the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 and in particular points 27 and 30 thereof, contain provisions which confirm the powers and the procedures of the budgetary authority on classification of expenditure and corresponding authority, B. whereas the Council has refused, until now, to cooperate loyally with the European Parliament in identifying the financial appropriations needed for this accession and thereby intends to decide unilaterally on amounts related to non-compulsory expenditure, which become temporarily compulsory after the entry into force of the Accession Treaty, C. whereas such a refusal implies a significant violation of the budgetary powers and prerogatives of the European Parliament and is in breach of the inter-institutional agreement on budgetary discipline of 6 May 1999, 1. Deplores the fact that the Council did not agree to adopt the Joint Declaration annexed to this text, as agreed with the Council's Presidency and whereby the three institutions must agree on the budgetary implications of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania; 2. Underlines that the intention of the Council to decide unilaterally to enter non- compulsory expenditure in the Accession Treaty, without previous consultation and agreement of the European Parliament, is a clear violation of the EC Treaty and a significant breach of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline; 3. Notes furthermore with concern that on 22 March 2004 the Council considered the Commission proposal for a financial package for Romania and Bulgaria to be fair and equitable, completely excluding the other arm of the budgetary authority; 4. Rejects this serious violation of the Parliament's institutional and budgetary powers by including non-compulsory expenditure in the annex to the Accession Treaties, even if this only applies for a temporary period and represents a partial derogation of Article 272 of the EC Treaty; 5. Notes the Commission proposal in its Communication to the Council and
