WRITTEN QUESTION E-4411/09 by Dan Jørgensen (S-D) to the Commission (21 September 2009) Subject: Postponement of postal service liberalisation By 1 January 2011, all EU Member States (with the exception of the new Member States of 2004 plus Greece and Luxembourg) are to have completed full liberalisation of the postal market. According to the European postal companies, there has been a substantial slump in turnover in the wake of the financial crisis. For example, between 2007 and 2008, there was a fall of 7.5% in Germany, 10% in Finland, 12.7% in Sweden and 10% in Denmark. A 2009 Pique report (http://www.hiva.be/docs/rapport/R1294.pdf) concludes that liberalisation of the market will entail a marked reduction in service for private customers and a possible fall of up to 20% in the number of jobs in the postal sector. These figures speak loud and clear at a time when we have not yet seen the worst fallout from the financial crisis. There are therefore good grounds for expecting a further reduction in turnover between 2008 and 2009. When this situation is combined with an already falling volume of mail, there is a risk that Europeans will suffer severe cutbacks in their postal services. In the light of the above challenges posed by the forthcoming liberalisation of postal services, will the Commission say: 1. how it will ensure that the liberalisation of postal services does not entail serious social and economic repercussions in the form of job losses and cuts in services, and 2. whether it will allow individual Member States to postpone liberalisation of their national postal sectors to beyond 2011?
