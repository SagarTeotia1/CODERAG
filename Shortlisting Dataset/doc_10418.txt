9.3.2006 PROPOSAL FOR AMENDMENT OF PARLIAMENT'S RULES OF PROCEDURE pursuant to Rule 202 of the Rules of Procedure by Giuseppe Gargani Amendment of Rule 201 Application of the Rules of Procedure PARLIAMENT'S RULES OF PROCEDURE Present text Amendments Amendment 1 Rule 201, paragraph 1 a (new) 1a. Committee chairmen may refer to the committee responsible matters concerning the interpretation of the se Rules of Procedure which arise in connection with the exercise by the committees of the powers and responsibilities granted to them by the se Rules of Procedure. Or. fr Justification The committee and delegation chairmen are required to apply and interpret the Rules of Procedure when performing their duties. Accordingly, they should have the right to refer to the competent body, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, matters arising in connection with the exercise by the committees and delegations of the powers and responsibilities granted to them by the Rules of Procedure. Such a measure would help to guarantee uniformity in the application of the Rules of Procedure and legal certainty within Parliament's internal system of rules. Moreover, a precedent for this proposal can be found in Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure, which, pursuant to Rule 186, is applicable in committee. Paragraph 5 of that rule, which concerns points of order, stipulates that 'the President may refer the matter to the committee responsible'.
