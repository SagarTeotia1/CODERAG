and in particular the continuation of the compendium of Member States’ agreed practices published in Annex I and the table in Annex II containing data on the number and value of export licences issued and the value of arms exports; 3. Welcomes in particular the improvements in the information provided by both old and new Member States in regard to their respective arms exports; but is, nevertheless, concerned about the value of the data provided in some instances; 4. Considers that the provision of timely, complete and compatible data by all Member States is essential to ensure the transparency of the data provided; 5. Is delighted that the process of harmonising reporting procedures has been continued and that further steps have been taken towards achieving fully comparable statistics between EU Member States; 6. Wishes, therefore, despite the progress made in achieving greater harmonisation of statistical data, to see that each Member State provides data on the type and quantity of arms supplied and on the total value of exports and the number of licences refused, stating the reasons for refusal, and more precise information on the country of destination and classification of end-users, in order, on the basis of such fuller and more harmonised data, to improve transparency; 7. Welcomes in this regard the establishment of a central database of denial notifications at the Council Secretariat in Brussels and stresses its usefulness, since it will immediately give all Member States a source of information enabling them to investigate specific denials; calls for the expansion, in due course, of this database to include information on consultations under the Code of Conduct as well as on end-users who are known or suspected to have engaged in the re-export, diversion or misuse of arms and other controlled goods; 8. Wishes, furthermore, that information be included in the national arms exports reports on informal denials of arms exports before an official application for obtaining a licence; 9. Stresses the usefulness of this central database of denial notifications, since it will immediately give all Member States a source of information enabling them to investigate specific denials; 10. Welcomes the new and updated version of the EU Common Military List and its publication in the Official Journal; calls on Member States to make their reporting on "dual-use" exports more detailed and transparent because they have been frequently used for human rights abuses; 11. Considers that the wording of the Code of Conduct is leading to diverging interpretations by different Member States and welcomes, therefore, the User's Guide to the Code, which defines and clarifies the operative provisions of the Code; calls on Member States to amend the export criteria to improve their clarity and comprehensiveness and to ensure they fully reflect States’ existing responsibilities under international law; 12. Welcomes the fact that a survey on how to apply criterion 8 (compatibility of arms exports with the technical and economic capacity of the recipient country) was initiated, representing a significant contribution to crisis prevention and sustainable development in socially less developed countries, whilst urging Member States to repeat the
