Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (18 March 2010) On your first question, I would like to draw your attention on Articles 82 to 86 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 OJ L 30, 31.1.2009 , p. 16. which already provide for a Community area payment scheme for nuts. Under this scheme, farmers producing hazelnuts are granted an average aid of EUR 120.75 per hectare per year. This average amount can be doubled by the Member States, which are allowed to grant additional national aid to hazelnuts producers up to an additional maximum amount of EUR 120.75 per hectare. Further, Member States have some room for manoeuvre when implementing the scheme: they may for instance make the granting of the aid conditional on farmers being members of a producer organisation (Article 85(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009); they may also, on the basis of objective criteria and taking into account the specific characteristics of the production concerned, fix a minimum tree density higher than 125 hazelnut trees per hectare (Article 15(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 OJ L 316, 2.12.2009 , p. 27. ). As from 2012 at the latest the above payments will be integrated into the single payment scheme. I also would like to emphasise that the area payment for nuts is far from being the only source of support available for the rural area of Viterbo that you mention in your request. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) offers several support instruments that can address the risk of abandonment and the socioeconomic difficulties of mountain and hill areas, such as the area of Monti Cimini. Under the CAP first pillar Member States have the possibility to make use of Article 68 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 by granting specific support, inter alia , in areas subject to restructuring and/or development programmes in order to ensure against land being abandoned and/or to address specific disadvantages for farmers in those areas. Under the CAP second pillar, a wide set of targeted measures is available to sustain farming in marginal areas; for instance, under the Less Favoured Areas scheme, up to an average aid of EUR 250 per hectare can be granted to farmers in mountain areas. I therefore consider that it is incumbent upon the national authorities to make the best possible use of the opportunities offered by the common agricultural policy, before studying the option of establishing an additional specific support scheme for hazelnut production. As regards the proposal to raise the aflatoxin threshold, the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted on 25 January 2007 an opinion on the potential increase of consumer health risk by a possible increase of the existing maximum levels for aflatoxins in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios and derived products The EFSA Journal (2007) 446, 1-127. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/cs/BlobServer/Scientific_Opinion/CONTAM%20_op_ej446_aflatoxins_en,3.pdf?ssbinary=true . The CONTAM Panel concluded that changing the maximum levels for total aflatoxins from 4 to 10 µg/kg in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios would have only minor effects on the estimates of dietary
