Question for Question Time H-0316/2010 to the Commission Part-session: July 2010 Rule 116 Vilija Blinkevičiūtė (S&D) Subject: Microfinance supply A decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the supply of microfinance under the Progress programme was adopted in March of this year. The Commission had promised that this decision would come into force as early as the summer and that national credit providers, once they had received funds under the European Investment Fund (EIF), would be able to start providing credit from the start of next year. The Commission and the EIF have been in negotiations for some time on the specific conditions governing the transfer of funds (Article 5(2) of the decision), but it is not yet known when these negotiations will be completed, even though the Commission had promised to inform the Council of the progress of the negotiations. Can the Commission indicate how long the negotiations with the EIF will take and when they are scheduled to be completed?
