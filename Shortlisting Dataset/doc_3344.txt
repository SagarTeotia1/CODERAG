Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (4 January 2011) The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that the chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu is considered to be one of the most damaging insects to chestnut. In the EU, it was recorded for the first time in Italy (Piedmont region) in 2002. In order to prevent additional introductions of the chestnut gall wasp from third countries as well as its further spread within the Community, the Commission put in place provisional emergency measures against this pest in 2006 (Commission Decision 2006/464/EC OJ L 183, 5.7.2006, p. 29 . ). Research on the chestnut gall wasp is already taking place in two projects funded under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7): Increasing Sustainability of European Forests: Modelling for Security Against Invasive Pests and Pathogens under Climate Change (ISEFOR) and Enhancement of pest risk analysis techniques (PRATIQUE). The project ISEFOR will use Dryocosmus kuriphilus, among other pests, as a model species in order to predict its spread and impacts under climate change. The project PRATIQUE has selected this pest to test and validate some of the project results (e.g. the decision support system for the eradication and containment of pest outbreaks, techniques and tools for mapping endangered areas, etc.).
