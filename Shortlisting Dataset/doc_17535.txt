Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (11 June 2010) The decision of the Portuguese Government to which the Honourable Member refers, concerns the possible reimbursement of a medicinal product. It should be stressed that the authorisation of a product is by no means connected to the reimbursement of the product. European Union legislation does not affect the powers of the Member States’ authorities as regards their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance schemes, on the basis of health, economic and social conditions. Each Member State is responsible for the management of its national healthcare budget, while ensuring appropriate access to treatments for its citizens. It is therefore in the Member States’ discretion if and to what extent products are reimbursed. For further details, the Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑468/2010 by the Honourable Member, and its joint answer to Written Questions P‑3016/10 by Ms Bastos and E‑3075/10 by the Honourable Member, on the same subject http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB .
