ORAL QUESTION H-0052/10 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Papanikolaou to the Council Subject: Cooperation between the EU and Turkey over illegal immigration Most illegal immigrants to the EU arrive in Greece from Turkey across the maritime borders. From Greece they then move on to the rest of the EU. Given that Turkey quite justifiably wishes to become a member of the European Union, what initiatives does the Spanish Presidency intend to take to put pressure on Turkey to cooperate, since cooperation is indispensible? How does the Presidency judge progress in the negotiations between the EU and Turkey on the readmission agreement and between Turkey and Frontex on the agreement for exchanging information and involving Turkey in joint operations? Is Greece being notified of progress in these negotiations?
