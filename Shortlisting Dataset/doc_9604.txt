WRITTEN QUESTION E-1734/08 by Neil Parish (PPE-DE) to the Commission (28 March 2008) Subject: Atlantic tuna The Commission’s consultation document outlines the important role of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in shark fisheries management. We were therefore dismayed to hear that, at the 2007 ICCAT annual meeting, the European Commission (representing the Community) expressed its intent to limit 2008 ICCAT proposals to those related to tuna and swordfish. This is especially troubling given that the September ICCAT shark assessment workshop will produce an unprecedented amount of advice on sharks for the ICCAT Parties. How will the Commission alter this stance to ensure that shark proposals receive full consideration at this year's ICCAT annual meeting?
