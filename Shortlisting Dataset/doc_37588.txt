WRITTEN QUESTION P-3230/06 by Carl Schlyter (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (10 July 2006) Subject: Legislation in new Member States I wonder how the total number of pages of legislation changes after accession. New Member States have acquired new EU legislation while at the same time part of their national legislation has been rendered redundant. For countries such as Malta, which had no reason to regulate rail transport or a number of other fields which were never previously relevant, the total must have grown. In some others, perhaps, old rules have disappeared to the same extent as EU membership has introduced new ones. How many pages of legislation did SE, FI, AT and the 10 new Member States have before and after accession to the EU? How many pages of legislation does the EU now have, broken down into regulations, directives and Commission decisions of a temporary nature, such as those dealing with farm prices?
