Question for written answer E-9702/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 William (The Earl of) Dartmouth (EFD) (26 November 2010) Subject: EU food subsidies Does the Commission believe that there are any current examples of food, the production costs of which have been subsidised by the EU and which is then sold outside the EU at prices which are only possible as a result of that subsidy, or has such dumping been eliminated?
