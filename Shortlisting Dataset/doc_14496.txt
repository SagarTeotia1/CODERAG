Question for written answer E-5650/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Aldo Patriciello (PPE) (19 July 2010) Subject: Female unemployment Figures for female unemployment show that Italy and the rest of Europe are lagging well behind the Lisbon objectives set in 2000. In our country, Italy, at present 46.3 % of women are in employment, as opposed to the 60 % figure that should have been reached last year. This is alarming bearing in mind that all types of employment contracts are included in this figure (including partnerships on projects and fixed-term contracts). In the majority of cases, women are underemployed. Despite their brilliant university degrees, only a few manage to reach senior positions; positions that nearly always entail huge sacrifices and privation in their personal and family life. Furthermore society really uses them as a safety valve, without ever acknowledging this fact. It is women who take care of the elderly, children and the sick, often after being at work, stepping in where governments, through lack of funds and infrastructure, fail. Finally it should be noted that it is women aged below 30 or over 55 who experience the greatest difficulties in finding a job. Most of these women are obliged to rely, where they can, on the family unit. Today they are among the categories most at risk of poverty and social exclusion. In light of the above: 1. What plans does the Commission have to assist women to enter the job market? 2. Furthermore, would it be possible to set up funds for projects to make the aforementioned categories more competitive?
