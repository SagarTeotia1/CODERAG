Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (27 February 2012) The Finnish authorities' report received on 24 August 2011 states that there is one pack of seven wolves living in the reindeer herding area. In addition, there are wolves present in the southern and eastern parts of the reindeer herding area. Altogether there are 20-25 wolves in the Finnish reindeer herding area. Wolves are known to cause certain damage to reindeer herding. Compensation paid for predator damages in the reindeer herding area is not limited to wolves. We agree with the Honourable Members that compensation is just one tool to be applied when acceptance for the protection of wolves is sought, and would encourage Finland to implement all relevant measures. The Commission would refer the Honourable Members to its answers to Written Question E‑3942/2008 by Ms Hassi, and written questions E‑3765/2009 and E‑3329/2010 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp by Ms Hassi and Ms Pietikäinen regarding the measures taken by Finland in relation to poaching. The Commission considers that Finland should be given more time to show that the adopted approach works. Should there be no improvement of the situation the Commission will not hesitate to take appropriate action, including legal steps, if necessary.
