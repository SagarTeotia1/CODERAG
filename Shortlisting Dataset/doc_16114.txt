Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2012) The Commission considers that Directive 85/337/EEC Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, as amended by Directive 97/11/EC, OJ L 073, 14.3.1997, Directive 2003/35/EC, OJ L 156, 25.6.2003 and Directive 2009/31/EC, OJ L 140, 5.6.2009. as amended (known as the Environmental Impact Assessment or EIA Directive) is applicable to this shale gas exploration project in Alava, Spain. Deep drilling projects are covered by Annex II.2.d of the EIA Directive. Annex II projects are subject to a screening by the competent authorities to determine whether an EIA is required, in accordance with Article 4(2)-(4) and on the basis of the criteria listed in Annex III of the directive. The Spanish environmental authorities have carried out such a screening for this project, which is summarised in the Statement of 21 November 2011 issued by the Secretary of State for Climate Change of the Ministry for the Environment, published in the Official Journal (BOE) No 295 of 8 December 2011 (pages 130225-130232). The Spanish environmental authorities, taking into account the abovementioned Annex III criteria, concluded and justified that a complete EIA procedure is not necessary for this project. According to the available information, no breach of the EIA Directive can be identified in this case. Therefore, the Commission does not intend to take further action.
