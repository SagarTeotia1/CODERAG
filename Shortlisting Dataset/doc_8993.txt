WRITTEN QUESTION E-5901/07 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (29 November 2007) Subject: Post-war care for soldiers in Britain In a recent public statement the Royal British Legion claimed that post-war care for soldier victims is seriously lacking in Britain. This is very sad when one considers that the soldiers concerned risked their lives in the performance of their duty to their country. Whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, can the Commission in any way help to remedy this sorry state of affairs?
