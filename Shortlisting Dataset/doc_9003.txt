Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (1 December 2008) Directives 2008/50/EC OJ L 152, 11.6.2008. on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe and 2004/107/EC OJ L 23, 26.1.2005. relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air (as well as the precursors to the directive 2008/50/EC which remain in force pending the transposition of Directive 2008/50/EC required by June 2010 96/62/EC; 1999/30/EC; 2000/69/EC, 2002/3/EC. ) require a comprehensive assessment of ambient air quality throughout the EU territory, which must be reported annually by Member States to the Commission Description and aggregate results at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/reporting.htm . The directives require continuous monitoring of a number of regulated pollutants in the most polluted areas and for periodic assessment by other means such as modelling or indicative measurements in all other areas. Reports are due by 30 September every year. According to the information currently available, Ireland is the only Member State officially confirming no exceedances in 2007. The Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy have not yet reported in full Status 13 October 2008. . Air quality plans containing specific measures for the area are only required in cases where specific thresholds are exceeded prior to the limit values becoming mandatory. This serves as a means of ensuring that appropriate steps are taken in time to achieve compliance with the limit values by the attainment date. In June 2008 the Commission asked 23 Member States that reported exceedances of the PM 10 limit values to indicate the measures they are taking to achieve compliance. Article 22 of Directive 2008/50/EC provides the possibility to notify a time extension for achieving compliance with the limit values for particulate matter (PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and benzene. Notifications will be assessed specifically for each pollutant and each air quality zone in question. Time extensions will apply for a limited period of time (for PM 10 until June 2011 and for NO 2 and benzene until 2015 at the latest). During the time extension period limit values will continue to apply together with a margin of tolerance. Member States wanting to take advantage of the possibility of time extensions were required to notify the time extensions by 31 October 2008 in relation to PM 10 and by 30 September 2011 in respect of NO 2 and benzene. The Commission will consider taking infringement action in respect of zones or agglomerations exceeding the limit values where a notification for a time extension is not received by the deadline. To date, 9 Member States have made a notification under Article 22 relating to PM 10 and NO 2 in all their zones and agglomerations. However, further notifications are expected. Where time extensions are notified, the Commission has nine months in which to raise any objections. In this context, any ongoing infringement action for the directives listed in the directive 2008/50/EC Annex XV B(2) will be specifically assessed by the Commission. Objection will be considered if an adverse effect on the concentration levels of the pollutant in question in the notified
