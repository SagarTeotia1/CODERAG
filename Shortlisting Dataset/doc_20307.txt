Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2011) The results of the study referred to confirm that in countries with no comprehensive smoking bans in the hospitality sector, the levels of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke remain high. The Commission welcomes the new smoke-free rules adopted by Spain which make all hospitality venues smoke-free. The Commission believes that comprehensive smoke-free laws covering all indoor workplaces and public places, as recommended by the guidelines for the implementation of Article 8 of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control of July 2007 http://www.who.int/fctc/cop/art%208%20guidelines_english.pdf and the Council recommendation on smoke-free environments of 30 November 2009 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009H1205(01):EN:NOT , are the most effective means of protecting citizens from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Regarding the protection of workers' health it is important to note that EU occupational safety and health legislative acquis applies. This includes the occupational exposure limit values which have been adopted for these two substances. For benzene the binding limit value is 3.25mg/m 3 for an 8 hour time weighted average (TWA), which is equivalent to 3,250μg/m 3 , and for nicotine the indicative limit is 0.5mg/m 3 for 8 hours, which is equivalent to 500μg/m 3 . These values were adopted in Directives 2004/37/EC OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 50 . and 2006/15/EC OJ L 38, 9.2.2006, p. 36 . respectively.
