Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (4 February 2005) Motorway projects such as the one referred to by the Honourable Member are subject to mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA) under the terms of the EIA Directive (Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 . , as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 . ). EIAs are, amongst other things, required to examine impacts on the archaeological heritage. The Commission confirms that it has received correspondence from objectors to the motorway that will pass through the Tara-Skyrne valley in County Meath. It is currently examining this correspondence in the light of the requirements of Directive 85/337/EEC in relation to the project.
