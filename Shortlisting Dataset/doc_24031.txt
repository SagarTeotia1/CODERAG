WRITTEN QUESTION E-0945/10 by José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (PPE) , Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE) , Jo Leinen (S&D) , Graham Watson (ALDE) , Charles Tannock (ECR) and Fiorello Provera (EFD) to the Council (26 February 2010) Subject: India as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council To what extent does the Council support a permanent place for India on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)? Given India’s vast geographical size, population, diplomatic influence, major contribution to UN peacekeeping efforts and regional leadership status, what benefits for global and regional security does the Council foresee if India becomes a permanent member of the UNSC? To what extent does the Council believe that India’s permanent membership of the UNSC would enhance the authority and effectiveness of UN action generally, and in the anti-terrorism field specifically? What is the Council’s view of proposals for a second tier of UNSC permanent membership for countries that would not be able to veto UNSC resolutions?
