WRITTEN QUESTION P-0943/06 by Stavros Arnaoutakis (PSE) to the Commission (2 March 2006) Subject: Problems in implementing ESF ‘local employment initiatives’ in rural and less-favoured areas of Greece For the first time a set of ‘local employment initiatives’ is included among the measures being carried out under the current ESF programme for Greece. The programme provides advice, training and placement services for socially excluded categories including women, the unemployed, the underemployed, etc. However, the measures are not proving to be fully effective, particularly in rural and less-favoured areas, since the Manpower Employment Authority (OAD), the final beneficiary, takes the view that only holders of valid unemployment cards are entitled to assistance in finding employment, thereby excluding the underemployed from the outset. The criteria now being applied by the OAED for the issuing of unemployment cards in Greece are different from those applicable when the decision concerning those to be included under the programme was originally made with the result that those with OGA (Agricultural Insurance Fund) cover are now totally excluded irrespective of their revenue. Paradoxically this means that unemployed persons originally eligible for inclusion in the programme and who have completed the preliminary stages, are now ineligible for assistance in finding employment. This has led to a general feeling of disillusionment in rural and hinterland areas particularly among young people affected by problems of employment or underemployment, creating a credibility gap regarding the implementation and effectiveness of Community programmes. Is the EU aware of this situation and what action does it intend to take in response to such bureaucratic and inflexible attitudes, which are undermining the effectiveness of ESF initiatives particularly in rural and less-favoured areas?
