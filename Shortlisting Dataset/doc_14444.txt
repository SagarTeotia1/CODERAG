Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (27 February 2008) The European Court of Justice held in Case C‑307/05 Del Cerro Alonso OJ C 269 of 10.11.2007 . that the concept of ‘employment conditions’ referred to in clause 4(1) of Annex to Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederation of Europe (UNICE) and the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation (CEEP) Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEE , OJ L 175, 10.7.1999 . (‘the framework agreement’) must be interpreted as meaning that it can act as a basis for a claim such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which was a length of service allowance. It should however be noted that in the case of Mrs Del Cerro Alonso, the employer had already accepted that her time on fixed-term contracts would count towards her length of service for pay purposes, but it could not pay a three year length of service allowance as it was reserved under national law for permanent staff. The Court concluded that clause 4(1) must be interpreted as precluding a difference of treatment solely on the basis that it is provided for in national legislation or by a collective agreement. The Court, however, did not consider the more general issue of whether service on fixed-term contracts should count towards length of service for a subsequent indefinite contract. The Commission infers from this that the principle of non-discrimination in ‘employment conditions’ in Clause 4 of the framework agreement, and reproduced in Greek Presidential Decree 164/2004, does cover financial conditions. In respect of points 2 and 3, the Commission recalls that the application of Presidential Decree 164/2004 in Greece is a matter for the national competent authorities, and that remedies for discrimination contrary to Clause 4 of the framework agreement must be addressed to them.
