Stresses the need to investigate social, economic and legislative innovations which respect and promote the Community acquis - involving all stakeholders and on the basis of collective agreements, as required at institutional level - and considers that it is necessary to change the way in which work is organised and to promote a working culture based on trust, dignity, responsibility, security and flexibility; 2. Stresses the social and economic importance of getting more people into employment; underlines that high unemployment in Europe today undermines wealth and future prosperity as well as European competitiveness, and, even more importantly, creates social segregation and division between employed and unemployed people and, for unemployed individuals, without doubt, leads to isolation, dependence and reduced self-esteem; 3. Underlines that the European economy needs more people in employment in order to be able to compete globally and to fulfil the promises of social security; 4. Emphasises that the high level of unemployment in Europe is a failure which calls for actions making it easier for more people to enter the labour market, increasing mobility on the labour market and making it easier for individuals to change jobs without losing security; 5. Calls for reforms making it more important to stay on the labour market, reducing the risks of poverty traps and segregation; 6. Sets the objective of creating 'more and better jobs' with a view to using growth and competitiveness to improve living and working conditions and pursuing development with due respect
