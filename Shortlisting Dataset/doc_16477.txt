In reports tabled to plenary, the Agriculture Committee calls for a smaller cut in farm aid and a limited increase in milk quotas as well as special aid for milk producers and livestock farmers. It also argues that, for certain sensitive sectors, intervention schemes and the link between subsidies and production should be preserved. An additional Agriculture Committee meeting will be held in Strasbourg on Monday 17 November to sift through the high number of amendments proposed to the report. The four reports, drafted by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos (PES, PT), strike a balance between the various proposals put forward by MEPs during debates on the health check and also reflect the variety of situations facing farmers in the European Union. These compromises were adopted by comfortable majorities in the Agriculture Committee last month but new amendments cannot be ruled out on certain points, given the sensitive nature of the legislation. In agriculture policy, the Parliament's opinions currently have only consultative status. If the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, MEPs - who are directly elected by the voters - will have joint decision-making power with the Council of agriculture ministers. However, because of the importance of the CAP health check, which will make the last major changes to this policy area before the negotiations on the EU's next multiannual budget framework (which starts in 2013), the French presidency of the Council has promised to cooperate closely with MEPs, thereby enabling the two institutions to find common ground on most key issues. MEPs call for smaller shift towards rural development An important feature of the last CAP reform was a decision to shift part of EU agriculture spending away from direct farm income support towards national rural development programmes, so as to support activities such as rural tourism (a policy known as "modulation"). This decision was linked to the need to comply with WTO rules on farm subsidies. As part of the health check, the Commission has proposed speeding up the process of switching funds towards rural development. This subject was hotly debated in the EP Agriculture Committee, which in the end adopted a compromise calling for the transfer of funding to proceed more gradually so as not to hit farmers too hard. MEPs want the current 5% transfer rate applicable to farmers receiving more than €5000 in EU subsidy to rise to only 7% by 2013, rather than the 13% proposed by the Commission. MEPs agreed to a higher rate for farms that receive over €100,000 from the EU, but
