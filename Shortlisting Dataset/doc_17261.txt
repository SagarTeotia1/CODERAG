Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (14 December 2010) 1. The Commission is currently assessing new information received from the Romanian authorities and third parties, and is in constant contact with the Romanian authorities in order to obtain further clarifications on this case. 2. Concerning alleged plans of a creation of an industrial conglomerate by Oltchim, the Commission notes that it opened the formal investigation procedure in this case in relation to a notified State support package. The package consists of a debt-to-equity swap for the value of approximately EUR 135 million, and a guarantee to be issued by the State, in its role as majority shareholder of Oltchim S.A., to back up a commercial loan of EUR 424 million for the restart of the Arpechim ethylene installation and further modernisation investments. This support package was notified by the Romanian government as not involving state aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU; according to the Romanian authorities, a private operator with a similar involvement with the company (i.e. main shareholder and main creditor of the company) would have probably supported the company on similar terms. The Commission shall take into account all the relevant and verified facts for assessing the notified support package under the EU State aid rules. 3. Regarding the timing of the case, the Commission endeavours to take a timely decision on this case when all the relevant information and evidence is available. 4. Finally, with regard to the question of pending debt of Oltchim S.A. towards the electricity provider Electrica, and whether this might involve unlawful state aid, the Commission has requested information from the Romanian authorities on these issues in order to be in a position to have a view on the aid character of that measure.
