WRITTEN QUESTION E-4409/05 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Council (29 November 2005) Subject: Chechnya Sheltering under the concept of the ‘fight against terrorism’, Russia is gradually exterminating the Chechen people. In a region which the world has forgotten, human rights are being systematically abused on a daily basis. This is similar to what once occurred in the former Yugoslavia, with the difference that Chechnya is ignored by the international community. Or at least, this is what appears to be the case. 1. What action is the Council taking in order to prevent innocent human beings from continuing to be killed indiscriminately by Russian troops? 2. How is the issue being dealt with at the meetings which the Council's representatives hold with the Russian authorities?
