payment appropriations capped at 1.14 per cent of Community GDP, leaving a margin of 0.1 per cent under the own-resources ceiling. They take the view that the EU's financial arrangements must reflect the needs of Community policies in an enlarged EU. The opposite approach, of adjusting policies to a financial framework which can vary at the whim of governments, must be avoided. Among other points, Parliament states its readiness to evaluate proposals for a general correction mechanism based on the principle of Community solidarity. This would be part of a reform of the current system of own resources in order to give it more visibility for European citizens and to take national considerations into account. Lastly, MEPs restate their wish for the duration of the next financial perspective to move in step with the term of office of the Commission and Parliament. This would mean introducing a five-year programming period without waiting until 2013, the date chosen by the Commission and implicitly dictated by the Council. Mr Wynn's report follows the presentation by the Commission in February of its proposals for the 2007-2013 financial perspective.

Regarding the financial framework, MEPs stress the fall in the ceilings for heading 3 (internal policy), 4 (external action) and 5 (administrative expenditure) and note in particular that new needs should be met by finding new resources. The report makes the following points in the different policy areas: Agriculture: there should be greater support for young farmers, for the rural environment, for the fight against animal diseases and for European quality labels - all this is particularly important in the light of EU enlargement; Structural policy: the Member States should provide their forecasts for 2005; while there has been an improvement in the implementation of structural fund payment appropriations, there is a persistently large volume of outstanding commitments; Internal policies: the slow pace of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy makes it necessary to develop and reinforce measures to support and offer guarantees to small and medium sized enterprises; the joint immigration policy should be reinforced; the fight against
