2004/C 70 E/028 WRITTEN QUESTION P-3856/02 by Eija-Riitta Korhola (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 January 2003) Subject: Retail prices of fair-trade products Fair trade accounts for a relatively large share of consumption in Europe. In 1997 the turnover of fair-trade products was estimated at EUR 200-250 million. 11 % of European consumers buy such products, and surveys have revealed that there is very substantial demand for them. The EU has already adopted fair-trade initiatives, and NGOs and organisations which award fair-trade status also do their bit. Projects are also funded in developing countries. In the field of legislation, the EU has implemented fair-trade principles using numerous instruments, for example measures under the EU's Generalised System of Tariff Preferences. Despite all these measures, fair-trade products still cost far more than normal products, at least in Finland. How much support is provided for fair-trade products? Does the Commission know how the retail prices of fair-trade products currently compare with those of normal products, and what are the biggest cost items which contribute to the formation of the retail prices of fair-trade products? To what extent can national authorities influence these prices?
