Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (4 April 2007) Immediately after learning of the arrest of Dr Wykes, the Commission's Delegation in Luanda discussed the situation both with the local Presidency and the United Kingdom. It was agreed that, Dr Wykes being a British citizen, the UK Embassy would be in charge of the situation, while keeping the Presidency and EC Delegation informed of the developments, and in particular whether EU action was to be envisaged. In the meantime the Delegation contacted the Angolan Ombudsman to inform him that the Commission (Delegation and Headquarters) is monitoring the situation as closely as possible. The Ombudsman promised to put the subject forward to the National Prosecutor (Procurador Geral). According to the information received at a later stage, he did so. The Delegation also passed the same information to a number of human rights contacts in the country. Furthermore the Angolan Ambassador in Brussels was made aware of the Commission's interest in the matter. Sarah Wykes was apparently charged with espionnage and released on bail on Wednesday 21 February 2007. At the time of writing this reply Dr Wykes had been granted permission to travel to Luanda, but may not leave the country. The Commission has no further information on the precise nature of the charges against Dr Wykes. Close contacts among EU Heads of Missions on the ground continue on this matter, and further action might be considered if deemed necessary.
