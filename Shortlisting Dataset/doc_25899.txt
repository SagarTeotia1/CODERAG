ORAL QUESTION H-0535/05 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Caroline Lucas to the Council Subject: The Amendment of the Protocol on Origin of the EU-Israel Assocation Agreement On 29 November, 2004 the Commission presented to the Council a draft common Community position that mandates replacing the existing EU-Israel Association Agreement's Protocol on Origin with a new Protocol that will enable Israel's participation in the system of pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin. In its 'Explanatory Memorandum' introducing the draft Community position, the Commission states that '… the Community position should only be presented to the EU-Israel Association Council after solving the EU-Israel bilateral issue of rules of origin' (Brussels, 29.11.2004, SEC(2004)1437 final). Does the Council regard the practice resulting from the technical arrangement on EU-Israel customs cooperation that was put into effect on 1 February as 'solving the bilateral issue of rules of origin'?
