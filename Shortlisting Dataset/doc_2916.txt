important that the European Parliament be formally involved in scrutinising the implementation and the actions taken on the basis of the guidelines; underlines that the European Parliament must be able to hold the Council accountable; 9. Calls on the Council and the Commission, together with Parliament, to ensure that the application of the open method of coordination: – does not serve as a fig leaf for a country's failure to take action; – cannot be used as a means of replacing more binding forms of Community regulation, for the express purpose of avoiding such regulation and, at the same time, undermining the whole concept of the European Social Model; 10. Notes that, given that the open method of coordination is intended to be applied to a series of areas having direct implications for women, including the European strategy on employment and the policy for combating social exclusion, it is necessary to include the dimension of equal opportunities for men and women and gender mainstreaming at all levels of formalisation of this new policy management instrument; 11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the parliaments of Member States, the Economic and Social Committee and the President of the European Convention.
