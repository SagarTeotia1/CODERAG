Question for written answer E-000244/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (25 January 2012) Subject: Suicides in Trani and Turin prisons A 34-year-old inmate took his own life in Trani prison only a few hours after another suicide took place in Turin prison. The number of suicides in Italian prisons is alarming. In 2011, a total of 59 inmates committed suicide and there were 167 unsuccessful suicide attempts (these numbers are three times higher than those for the previous year). In addition, a study recently carried out by the Council of Europe shows that the rate of overcrowding in Italian prisons is among the highest anywhere. There is an average of 148.2 inmates for every 100 prison places. The prisoners are not only Italian nationals: one third of inmates (approximately 16 000) are foreign nationals, mostly from non-EU European countries. 1. Is the Commission aware that, in Italy, foreign nationals account for a very large proportion of the prison population and that the same applies throughout the EU? 2. Will it submit a legislative proposal on criminal justice in the field of detention, with particular reference to prison overcrowding, in order to follow up the Green Paper of 14 June 2011, COM(2011)0327?
