for the emancipation of women. The development of the future content and functions of the new technology must be a collective process in which women must not participate only as users, but also as planners and creators of the new technologies. PROPOSALS - POLICY MEASURES National and international policies in respect of the new technologies must always be evaluated on the basis of their impact on equality between men and women. Priority must be given to the development of programmes by and for women in the new technologies. There is a need for the systematic compilation of data on structural differences in the IT domain (level and type of education, type of work, promotion). Improving the access of women to the Internet and the new technologies requires the creation of an extended infrastructure and technological equipment in rural and semi-urban regions which are today not sufficiently well served for, especially the poorer regions and the candidate countries. In order to combat social exclusion, priority must be given to vulnerable groups of girls and women - immigrants, women with disabilities, the poor, single mothers and women farmers.
