Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (17 December 2007) On 18 July 2006, the European Court of Justice held in its judgment in Case C‑119/04 concerning the recognition of the acquired rights of former Lettori in six Italian universities (Universities of Basilicata, Milano, Palermo, Pisa, ‘La Sapienza’ Roma and Istituto universitario orientale di Napoli) that Decree-Law 2/2004 adopted by the Italian authorities on 14 January 2004 (and converted into Law 63/2004 of 5 March 2004) was an appropriate solution, as regards Community law, for the reconstruction of the careers of Lettori. As indicated in previous statements on this case (including in its reply to the Written Question P‑2691/07 by Mr De Rossa and in the press release of 27 June 2007 http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/927&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en ), the Commission has to accept the judgment of the Court. The Commission has no legal possibility to take this matter again to the Court on the basis of arguments that the Court explicitly rejected. As a result, the Commission decided to close the infringement procedure on 27 June 2007. The outcome of this procedure is relevant to the complaints submitted to the Commission by Lettori from other universities. The most direct and effective course of action now would be for the Lettori from other Italian universities to rely on the Court's ruling in the context of national means of redress to obtain comparable treatment to that provided for by the Law 63/2004. The Commission cannot re-open any issues already decided by the Court and could only do this on the basis of new and decisive legal elements.
