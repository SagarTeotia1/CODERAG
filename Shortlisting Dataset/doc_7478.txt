Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (27 August 2010) The Commission is aware of expectations of Brazilian producers to get better access to additional export markets, and in particular to the EU market. Of course Brazil, like other Mercosur countries, will look for improved market access conditions in the context of the recently resumed EU‑Mercosur negotiations for an Association Agreement. In this context, the Commission will obviously take into account the sensitivity of EU agriculture as a whole as well as the specific sensitivity of the pig meat sector. As regards non‑tariff measures and in particular sanitary import requirements, the EU has put in place a comprehensive set of health requirements for imports of meat from third countries to protect public and animal health. Those imports are only permitted from third countries or parts thereof that have been specifically authorised following an EU audit on the compliance of the EU's import conditions. The EU's high health standards are non-negotiable and the EU's import conditions are in no way lowered or changed by the trade agreements the EU has negotiated or is negotiating with countries in Latin America or with other third countries. Within this context, import of pig meat from Brazil is currently not authorised.
