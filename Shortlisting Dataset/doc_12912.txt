Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (14 April 2011) The Commission is committed to ensuring that all persons involved in judicial proceedings across the EU are provided with interpretation and translation when they do not understand or speak the language of the proceedings. As regards criminal procedures, as part of the legislative programme designed to enact minimum EU rules to enhance the protection of fair trial rights cf. ‘Council Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings’ of 23 October 2009. , the European Parliament and the Council passed Directive 2010/64/EU of 20 October 2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:280:0001:0007:EN:PDF . This instrument requires all Member States to ensure (by the transposition deadline, October 2013) that a suspected or accused person who does not understand or speak the language of the criminal proceedings is given access to an interpreter and is entitled to a translation of essential documents. As regards victims, Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA of 15 March 2001 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:082:0001:0004:EN:PDF on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings sets out communication safeguards in respect of victims having the status of witnesses or parties to the proceedings. This instrument also obliges Member States to minimise the difficulties faced where the victim is a resident of a state other than the one where the offence has occurred, particularly with regard to the organisation of the proceedings. The Commission will present in May a package of measures on victims' rights which aims to strengthen these information and communication safeguards.
