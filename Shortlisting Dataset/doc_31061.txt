ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0100/05 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Graham Watson , on behalf of the ALDE Group to the Council Subject: Health workers detained in Libya Five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor were sentenced to death in May 2004 by a Libyan court and have, since then, been waiting for the appeal hearing to begin before the Supreme Court. Detained or in house arrest since 1999, these health workers stand accused of having deliberately infected some 400 children with HIV at the Al Fateh Children’s Hospital in Benghazi. The judicial process has been marred by procedural shortcomings and accusations of torture, while international expertise has identified in-hospital infection as the probable source of infection. Could the Council outline measures taken by the European Union to assist in finding a satisfactory solution to this matter? Is the Presidency in office satisfied with the level of EU solidarity with Bulgaria, and what further measures could be taken by the European Union?
