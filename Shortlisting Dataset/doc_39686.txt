WRITTEN QUESTION E-4091/06 by Karl-Heinz Florenz (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (29 September 2006) Subject: Production of, and trade in, seed mixtures from native species of wild plants There is growing demand in the EU Member States for seed of native species of wild plants. From the point of view of nature conservation, the current practice of using seed originating from other regions in connection with agri‑environmental programmes or measures to offset environmental impact gives rise to problems. However, farmers and producers of wild plants have to date largely been barred, on the basis of EU law, from production of, and trade in, regional ‘nature conservation seed’. This problem has been recognised and a working group involving the Commission and Member States is currently working on a Commission directive on the marketing of wild and cultivated species with a view to maintaining genetic diversity. 1. What is the Commission's view of the practice of using seed of wild plants originally from an entirely different region in open countryside? Is this regarded as contrary to the guidelines on preserving biodiversity (CBD, Gothenburg Strategy, Natura 2000)? 2. What is the Commission's view of the aspect of the adulteration of flora resulting from neophytes being introduced into the wild and forming weeds that are introduced and spread together with globally produced seed? 3. Does the Commission consider it necessary to remove the legal barriers to the production of, and trade in, ‘nature conservation seed mixtures’? 4. Does the Commission take the view that the market is able to regulate the production volume for ‘nature conservation seed mixtures’ itself through supply and demand, or does it consider it necessary to lay down maximum production volumes for such seed mixtures? What, if applicable, are the Commission's arguments in support of such radical intervention in the free market?
