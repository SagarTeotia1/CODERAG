ORAL QUESTION H-0247/08 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Costas Botopoulos to the Commission Subject: Insurance Fund for Solidarity between Generations Article 149 of Greek Law No. 3655/2008 (Greek Government Gazette No. 58 A' of 3.4.2008) concerning the administrative and organisational reform of the social security system and other insurance provisions creates a reserve entitled the Insurance Fund for Solidarity between Generations to be used after 2019 to deal with problems which the social security system may encounter in the future. The resources of the Fund will be made up of 10% of the total annual revenue from the privatisation of public enterprises and organisations, 4% of the total annual revenue from VAT and 10% of the sums collected by social security bodies. Will the Commission factor into its estimates of the Greek budget deficit - and what method will it use to do so - the sums which will gradually accrue to this Fund, given that its main source of stable income will come from VAT resources? Does the Commission know how the Greek Government intends to cover the gap in budget revenue which will arise when the financing of the new Insurance Fund absorbs 4% of revenue from VAT and 10% of the total annual revenue from privatisations?
