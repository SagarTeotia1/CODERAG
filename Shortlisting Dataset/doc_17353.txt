Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (14 April 2009) The Commission is aware of Mr Alexis Sinduhije's situation. The Commission at all levels, including its Delegation in Bujumbura and Commissioner in charge of development and humanitarian aid during his recent visit to Burundi, has exerted pressure on the Government of Burundi regarding this case. A declaration by the EU Presidency has also expressed its regrets on the situation of Mr Sinduhije and similar messages have been expressed by some Member States representatives while on visit in Bujumbura. The case has been regularly monitored and has been brought to the attention of the authorities by the local heads of mission. In all these demarches it has been recalled that Burundi signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and that this imprisonment plays against the principles that should guide the reconstruction of a State in a post crisis situation. There must indeed be freedom of expression and association for all political parties in particular in the perspective of the harmonious preparation of the 2010 elections. In this context, the Commission has called on the Burundian authorities to respect all these principles as well as the inclusive political dialogue that must prevail under the Rule of Law. After all those demarches, the Commission is happy to share the latest news that it has just received concerning the decision of the High Court of Burundi ordering the release of Alexis Sinduhije and dropping all charges against him. This is definitely excellent news but the Commission will continue to follow closely the human rights situation in Burundi and recalling the government their full respect.
