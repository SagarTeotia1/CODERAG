28 January 2008 of the first European grouping of territorial cooperation ever, the ‘Eurométropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai’. This EGTC was formally set up by 14 partner institutions from parts of the French Département ‘Nord’ and parts of the Belgian regions of ‘West-Vlaanderen’ and ‘Hainaut’. The ‘Eurométropole’ will develop projects in the field of sustainable development, transport and services for the citizens to improve the every-day life of the almost 2 million inhabitants of the region. The formal creation of this EGTC had been enabled by specific permits by the national authorities in France and Belgium, although neither of the Member States had formally adopted its national EGTC provisions.
