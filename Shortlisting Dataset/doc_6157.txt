Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (23 February 2009) The mutual recognition of driving licences in the European Union is governed by Directive 91/439/EEC Directive 91/439/EEC of 29 July 1991 on driving licences, OJ L 237, 24.8.1991. on driving licences which provides in its Article 1 (2) the unconditional mutual recognition within the European Union of driving licences issued by the Member States, irrespective of the nationality of the holder. A driving licence issued in conformity with the directive allows its holder to drive a vehicle on the territory of the EU regardless of the Member State where the vehicle is registered. The case the Honourable Member describes suggests a possible infringement of the rule on mutual recognition of driving licences by the Portuguese authorities. Without prejudice to the full details of the case, which the Commission has not yet obtained, the person who has been fined could address a complaint to the competent authority in Portugal in order to obtain redress.
