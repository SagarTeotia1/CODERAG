Question for written answer E-9900/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Lorenzo Fontana (EFD) (26 November 2010) Subject: Infringement of human rights in Cuba — the case of Oscar Biscet Catholic doctor Oscar Elias Biscet has been imprisoned in a Cuban jail since 2003. According to the evidence provided by a number of human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights First, the conditions of imprisonment to which he has been subjected are so harsh as to have undermined his health in an alarming manner. Human Rights First, in particular, says that Biscet is suffering from chronic gastritis and hypertension, diseases which are progressing. On 14 September 2010, at the sidelines of a meeting with four Cuban former political prisoners, the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, called for the release of all political prisoners in Cuba. Relations between the EU and Cuba are governed by the ‘common position’ adopted in 1996, which, in actual fact, makes any diplomatic agreement conditional upon respect for human rights and democracy by the Castro regime. Given the background outlined above, can the Commission say whether it intends to take any measures to arrange for the release of Oscar Biscet and other political prisoners, and what those measures will be?
