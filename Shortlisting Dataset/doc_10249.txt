Question for written answer E-4390/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 David Campbell Bannerman (EFD) (16 June 2010) Subject: EEAS Geographic Balance The documents concerning the make up of the EEAS talk about the need for the EEAS to show ‘geographical balance’. Could the Commission explain what this means? Is this a reference to balance of staff from different EU nations? Or is it a reference to where the EEAS staff will be located in the world?
