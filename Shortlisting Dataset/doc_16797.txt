ORAL QUESTION H-0828/05 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by María Salinas García to the Commission Subject: Non-compliance with fisheries rules in the Mediterranean Fishermen who use traditional, environmentally sound fishing equipment (as is the case with Almeria's long-line fleet) are in a serious plight: they are the victims of unfair competition from certain vessels (French and Italian ones in particular) which use the banned - though much cheaper - drift nets and at the same time they suffer on account of the environmental damage caused by such practices, which result in a 40% reduction in catches. The rogue vessels are not pursued in any way by the authorities of the countries to which they belong - indeed, some governments even make changes to their internal law which enable Community rules to be circumvented. Is the Commission using all available means (including legal remedies) in order to force the Member States in question to ensure that their fishing vessels comply with the relevant Council regulation?
