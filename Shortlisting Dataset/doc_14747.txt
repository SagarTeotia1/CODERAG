2004/C 78 E/168 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2769/03 by Christopher Huhne (ELDR) to the Commission (16 September 2003) Subject: Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor examinations 1. Can the Commission confirm that a Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor (DGSA) in the UK is currently only required to be qualified and examined on ADR/RID (transportation of dangerous goods by road/rail), and not the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, even if the DGSA is advising on the transportation of dangerous goods going by sea? 2. If so, is the Commission satisfied that organisations transporting dangerous goods by sea can employ DGSAs who have no training or qualification in sea transport? 3. Does the Commission intend to propose amendments to the current Directive to ensure DGSAs have a compulsory examination in IMDG Code or an appropriate equivalent?
