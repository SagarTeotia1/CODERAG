Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (13 May 2011) Holiday homes, like other developments and activities, can be carried out within Natura 2000 areas in so far as they are compatible with the nature conservation objectives of the areas. This has to be assessed on the basis of the site protection and management requirements set out in Article 6 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 1. ; in particular, any significant deterioration or disturbance in the areas has to be avoided, while any new developments with a likely significant impact on the areas, either individually or in combination with other activities, have to be properly assessed and can only be authorised if they do not affect the integrity of the areas. It is the responsibility of the Member State competent authorities to ensure sound implementation of these provisions. As indicated in the Commission's reply to Written Question E‑000633/2011 by Mr Tremopoulos http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB , an effective way to address the compatibility of isolated dwellings with Natura 2000 conservation needs is through adequate management plans and zoning provisions contained therein, which can ensure sustainable management of the areas.
