Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (19 July 2007) At the last EU‑Russia human rights consultations on 3 May 2007 in Berlin, the EU raised a range of human rights issues in Russia, notably respect for the rule of law, the situation of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society after the entry into force of the law on NGOs and the law on countering extremist activity, the situation in Chechnya and the right to freedom of expression and association during the preparations for the forthcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections. The EU and Russia also had a thematic discussion on combating torture and ill-treatment. The Russian authorities outlined the legal framework on each of these issues and how this was put into effect in practice. The Russian authorities drew attention, inter alia , to work being undertaken, especially in cooperation with the Council of Europe, to strengthen the rule of law, noted that amendments to the NGO law were being considered and underlined the rapid process of economic reconstruction in Chechnya. The Russian delegation also stressed that, in their view, the media in Russia were pluralistic and reiterated Russia’s commitment to combating torture. Discussions also covered the EU and Russia’s cooperation with United Nations and Council of Europe human rights mechanisms.
