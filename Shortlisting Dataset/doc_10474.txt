Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (11 April 2007) According to the available information, if the railway project between Navalcarnero and Mostoles in the region of Madrid is developed, it will cross during a short distance the site of Community importance (SCI) ‘Cuenca del Río Guadarrama’ designated under Council Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. (the Habitats Directive). The Commission considers that, before authorising the project, the competent authorities must respect the safeguards and assessment procedures required under Articles 6(3) and 6(4) of the Habitats Directive. On the basis of the assessments, the authorities will decide if the project can go ahead, and if so, under what conditions. The Commission notes that the project related to the railway between Navalcarnero and Mostoles is currently in the stage of public information. It would seem that no decisions have yet been made as the proceedings to date are still ongoing, and, therefore, an infringement of Community law cannot be acknowledged. Therefore, the Commission will not take any measures at this stage, but will continue to monitor the situation in order to ensure that the provisions of the Habitats Directive are respected.
