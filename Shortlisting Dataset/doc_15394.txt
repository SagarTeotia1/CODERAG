ORAL QUESTION H-0261/08 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Hans-Peter Martin to the Council Subject: Operating framework for regulatory agencies In 2005 the Commission submitted a draft Interinstitutional Agreement on the European regulatory agencies. According to a communication of 11 March 2008 from the Commission (COM(2008)0135), this proposal has now been withdrawn. The communication stated that this was partly because negotiations on the draft agreement 'stalled during 2006', as the Council was 'not ready to give attention to the issue' and 'doubts [had been] raised over the use of an inter-institutional agreement as a vehicle'. What were the Council's reasons for refusing to negotiate on the Interinstitutional Agreement? What is the Council's view of the Commission communication of 11 March 2008? In the Council's opinion, what would have to happen in order to arrive at a solution acceptable to all three institutions regarding the operating framework for regulatory agencies before the end of this year?
