WRITTEN QUESTION E-2004/08 by Jens Holm (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 April 2008) Subject: The crooked knife and Norway The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has proposed a new regulation allowing the use of a special type of knife, (‘crooked knife’) for the stunning and killing of owned reindeer in northern Norway (Finnmark). The use of a knife for stunning animals is however forbidden in EC law, which is also binding for Norway due to a bilateral agreement. In a proposed regulation the Norwegian authorities suggest allowing a certain kind of knife called ‘crooked knife’ for stunning and killing tame reindeer outside abattoirs in the Sami areas of northern Norway. The EFTA Surveillance Authority has signalled that they are prepared to accept the regulation because the use of crooked knife is considered a cultural event under 93/119/EC OJ L 340, 31.12.1993, p. 21. Art. 1 No 2. However, the use of the crooked knife is not a cultural tradition. The Sami people do not regard the crooked knife as a traditional tool, and objectively it is a quite recent invention. How does the Commission respond to the criticism that the crooked knife is not a traditional tool, which would also imply that Norway should not be granted any exemption in accordance with current EC law?
