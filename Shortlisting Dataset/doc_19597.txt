WRITTEN QUESTION E-2693/06 by Elspeth Attwooll (ALDE) to the Commission (21 June 2006) Subject: Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive The United Kingdom Department for Trade and Industry has informed an English lighting company that the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 19 . will effectively ban the sale of various kinds of decorative luminaires, specifically those whose ‘mechanical’ parts are made of a hazardous substance, in addition to electrical components containing hazardous substances. This company has been informed that luminaires with ancillary parts or bases made from lead crystal, ceramics, brass, or other metals will be affected. Given that exemption requests can take many months to process, this could have serious consequences for companies producing and/or supplying luminaires. Can the Commission clarify why a decorative luminaire such as a lead crystal chandelier would be banned under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive?
