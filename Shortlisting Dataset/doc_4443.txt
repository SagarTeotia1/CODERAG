it does not have any influence on the implementation of its activities; stresses that the Parliament cannot accept such a passive role, which is contradictory to present-day requirements of transparency and accountability; considers that the legislative acts laying down the multiannual financial and technical guidelines of the Coal and Steel Research Fund should be brought under the co-decision procedure, whereby the Parliament would decide on these guidelines on equal terms with the Council; 2. Reminds that Article 4, paragraph 3 of the Financial Regulation requires prior authorisation from the Parliament and the Council before the Commission can accept donations that involve financial charges to the general budget; warns that the Parliament is prepared to reject this donation unless the multiannual guidelines of the Coal and Steel Research Fund are brought under co-decision; 3.
