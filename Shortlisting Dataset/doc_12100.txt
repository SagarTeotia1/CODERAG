Answer given by Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (15 July 2011) The Cohesion Fund project ‘Forest protection of natural heritage (fire brigade equipment)’ was approved by Decision C(2003)5204, modified by Decision C(2008)493. The project's objective is to co-finance ‘equipment for the Fire Service’, i.e. tanker trucks of different capacities, off-road vehicles, water pump machines, and plastic tanks suitable for aerial transportation. The total budget is EUR 32 million and the Cohesion Fund contribution is EUR 24 million. So far, EUR 19.2 million of the EU contribution has been paid to the national authorities. The Commission will assess the final project implementation at the closure of the project which is expected shortly. In addition, in the framework of the Operational Programme ‘Environment and sustainable development’ 2007‑13, the priority 8 ‘Prevention of environmental risks’ includes among its aims the management of forest fire incidents. Indicative actions include also forest fire equipment and support studies. The total budget allocated to priority 8 is EUR 40 million, and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) contribution is EUR 32 million. According to the latest information received from the national authorities, the budget of approved projects is approximately EUR 29 million. Gaps in national equipment and staffing cannot be covered by the civil protection financial instrument 2007/162/EC, Euratom: Council Decision of 5 March 2007 establishing a Civil Protection Financial Instrument, OJ L 71, 10.3.2007. which aims to facilitate reinforced cooperation between the Member States in the field of civil protection. Financial assistance under the civil protection financial instrument is available for specific actions such as studies, training, exercises, workshops, exchange of experts, public information, as well as small projects testing new approaches to reduce the risk of disasters. Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund OJ L 311, 14.11.2002. limits the use of grants from that Fund to emergency operations in response to a given disaster. Preventive measures may not be financed.
