Question for written answer E-010157/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (8 November 2011) Subject: Healing broken bones using ultrasound According to the BBC, Glasgow Royal Infirmary is using ultrasound technology to treat broken bones. The procedure can even be used to treat the most difficult fractures. This simple and painless method works by making the cells in the vicinity of the fracture vibrate, thus stimulating and speeding up the regeneration of the broken bone. The vibration of the cells also makes it easier to remove bacteria from the wound and stimulates the formation of new bone cells. A expert in this type of treatment has said that, before ultrasound was used, some fractures could be healed only with great difficulty, if at all. Experience has shown that ultrasound speeds the healing process up by about 40 % and helps ensure that the bone mends properly. Moreover, it can be used to treat complex fractures. The cost is very high, however, amounting to around GBP 1 000 per patient. The fact that this procedure is not used in other EU Member States might also be addressed, since it is an innovative and effective method in modern medicine. Can the Commission answer the following questions: — On the basis of what policies might the EU intervene in order to encourage the generalised use of this innovative treatment in healthcare in the EU? — Will the Commission take any action to publicise this method of healing broken bones, whilst seeking to reduce the cost of treatment?
