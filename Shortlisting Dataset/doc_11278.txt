particular road safety problems of urban areas; 5. Calls on the Commission to develop a long-term road safety concept, going beyond 2010 and describing the required steps leading to the avoidance of all fatalities and serious injuries caused by road accidents ('Vision Zero'); 6. Considers that the Commission should promote a move towards public transport and soft modes of non-motorised road transport with a view to improving road safety and considers furthermore that a clear framework of political support is necessary in this regard; 7. Is of the view that exchange of best practice and coordination of common policies call for enhanced policy coordination, the dissemination of irrefutable data so as to place poor performers under pressure and a more structured approach than has been the case so far; considers that the vital tasks for which a common approach is needed include, for instance, the following: - collecting, analysing and publishing data as well as safety-performance indicators, - harmonising accident statistics (and their subsequent inclusion in a EU database), - conducting Community-wide road safety campaigns, - promoting research programmes and possibly introducing new technologies in close cooperation with industry and other stakeholders, - enhancing cross-border information exchange and audits on the enforcement of Community legislation e.g. on driving times and rest periods in road transport, in order to stimulate more uniform interpretation and application of that legislation; 8. Asks the Commission to report to the European Parliament within two years on what institutional setting would be the most appropriate, in terms of independence and expertise, for evaluating and fostering progress on road safety; 9. Calls on the Council Presidency to host the 3rd Verona Conference in 2005 and initiate the Verona Process, incorporating it into the proposed EU road safety framework; expects the Verona Process to help create the necessary political leadership, as did the Cardiff or Lisbon processes, by encouraging top-level political decision makers to strongly commit themselves to reducing road accidents; furthermore, considers that performance indicators and peer reviews conducted by Member States can be efficient if used to "name, shame and fame" and thus create political pressure to reach targeted safety levels; 10. Points out that high-level engagement with regard to road safety can - as recently demonstrated in France, where a campaign launched in 2002 reduced the number of fatalities by 30% over two years - bring about significant results in a short time; calls for a higher level of political commitment to road safety across the EU; 11. Welcomes the fact that the European Road Safety Charter so clearly demonstrates that road safety is a shared responsibility and provides a means for the stakeholders concerned to undertake commitments; is concerned, however, that the Charter has not attracted as many adherents or publicity as initially foreseen; p roposes that the Charter be promoted by a campaign organised jointly at European and national level to publicise the commitments undertaken ; calls for adequate financial resources to be committed also by the Community Institutions and for a strengthened communication strategy to be developed so as to attract the interest of
