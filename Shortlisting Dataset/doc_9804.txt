WRITTEN QUESTION E-5344/08 by Robert Sturdy (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 October 2008) Subject: Plant protection and malaria There is growing concern that the current review of plant protection products legislation will considerably reduce the availability of insecticides not just in agriculture but also for public health protection. To what extent does the Commission agree that further market restrictions from the review of plant protection regulation in the EU will result not only in massive price hikes for PPPs and food products, but will also mean it will be increasingly difficult for industry to continue to produce pesticides for public health protection? To what extent does the Commission believe the implementation of new MRL standards, as well as the removal of even more chemicals from the market as proposed, will have a negative impact on public health schemes in Africa, where indoor spraying of insecticides, as well as the treatment of bed-nets, is crucial in reducing the spread of malaria?
