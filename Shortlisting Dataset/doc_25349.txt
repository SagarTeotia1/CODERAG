WRITTEN QUESTION E-4700/09 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (6 October 2009) Subject: Winding-up of four Greek insurance companies On Monday 21 September 2009 the Greek Private Insurance Supervisory Committee decided to revoke the operating licences of four insurance companies belonging to the Aspis Group (Aspis Welfare, Skourtis, General Trust and General Union) and, as a result, hundreds of workers have lost their jobs. The supervisory authority had repeatedly examined the capital adequacy of the companies in question, without however receiving satisfactory replies from them. Through a recent regulation (July 2009) the Greek Government provides a Greek State guarantee for the contracting company, or in the absence of a contracting company, for the insured persons. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. What kind of insurance contracts, apart from life insurance contracts, did the above companies offer, and what were the levels of insurance cover? 2. Have the rules of Law 3790/2007 governing state guarantees for life insurance contracts in the event of the bankruptcy of insurance companies been submitted to it for consideration? What procedure is provided for by Community legislation for the transfer of insurance contracts to other companies? 3. Does it consider that insured persons are covered by the above rules? Are their rights being safeguarded? 4. Has it included in the new Community Directive Solvency II any rules on job losses caused by the revocation of the licences of insurance companies? If not, what measures can they take in favour of dismissed workers?
