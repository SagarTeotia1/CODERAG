Question for written answer E-001630/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE) (23 February 2011) Subject: Caged beds Caged beds are a barbaric means of confinement and restraint for adults and children. In 2003 MDAC carried out research in four countries on their use of such beds and found their use to be widespread. Can the Commission outline any evidence it has about the continued illicit use of caged beds in EU Member States and what action it is taking to ensure that these are never used again?
