on the candidate countries - Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey - to tighten their national legislation and above all their practices in the areas of arms exports on the basis of the Code, and to report on this practice in accordance with Annexes I and II to the Fifth Annual Report, calls on the Commission to follow the progress closely in the accession negotiation process and calls on all current Member States to compile and publish national annual reports for the calendar year 2004, and for each year thereafter; 22. Considers that the new neighbours of the enlarged EU and countries with which the EU has concluded, or intends to conclude, a stabilisation and association agreement should also be asked to observe the Code of Conduct; particular attention should be paid to Kaliningrad which has in the past served as a transit point for shipments of military equipment and arms from other parts of Russia for illicit end-users; calls on the Council and Commission to prioritise in their cooperation with the Russian Federation measures to combat illicit trafficking, including regular information exchange on export and transit controls and licences; 23. Calls upon Member States to provide in a co-ordinated way sufficient assistance to all states that do not have the necessary means to properly implement the Code of Conduct; 24. Welcomes in this regard the fact that the governments of Poland and Sweden initiated five informal COARM meetings between old and new Member States on arms exports controls, with the recommendation that this system of COARM meetings be maintained and also that it be made more representative and regular, and welcomes the efforts of the government of the Netherlands to introduce candidate countries and other interested states to the practical application of the Code of Conduct; 25. Reiterates its call for legally binding provisions and full harmonisation of Member States’ arms export control policy as a short-term goal, and urges Member States to make progress in this direction, penalising any violation by enterprises registered in the EU of the arms embargoes of the UN, the EU, the OSCE or any Member State; 26. Recommends that, in the interim period, the following steps be taken: (a) full pre-consultation between the Member States with regard to transfers to regions susceptible to crises, together with the development of an EU checklist of “red flag” early warning indicators to indicate when there are serious concerns with regard to a particular end-user which could impact upon the licensing of arms exports; (b) a full multilateral approach to the consultation process in connection with decisions to grant or refuse licences, with, as a first step, a commitment by Member States to circulate to all other Member States the substance and result of any consultation to which they are party, particularly in the case of undercutting; (c) incorporation into national law of all the principles, criteria and operative provisions of the Code of Conduct, on the understanding that this does not affect the right of Member States to operate more restrictive national policies; (d) all future EU embargoes to
