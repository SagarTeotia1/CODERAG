Question for written answer E-002184/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (27 February 2012) Subject: Collapse in the Temple of Jupiter The Temple of Jupiter in Pompeii is crumbling. And so the archaeological crisis that began with the collapse of the House of the Gladiators continues. Several fragments of plaster from a greyish white non-frescoed wall fell in this ancient pagan place of worship, which is considered to be an archaeological jewel. The fragments have now been retrieved. The head of the Pompeii heritage department announced that it was a fragment of rough plaster approximately a metre long that had become detached ‘from the external surface of the eastern wall of the cell in the Temple of Jupiter’, situated in the Forum. The Temple, located in the northern section of the Forum, dates back to 250 BC. In 79 AD, when the eruption destroyed the city, the Temple was undergoing essential renovation work following the earthquake in 62 AD. The shrine stands on a raised podium, which is adorned with six Corinthian columns. In light of this, could the Commission state: 1. whether it is aware of this latest collapse in the Temple of Jupiter in Pompeii; 2. whether it intends to send observers to inspect the site of this latest collapse in the Temple of Jupiter; 3. whether, in addition to Article 4 of Regulation 1080/2006, which provides for the co-financing of investments in the protection, promotion and preservation of cultural heritage through the ERDF, there are any other specific EU programmes which could help preserve the Temple of Jupiter and make it safe, given its global historical and artistic importance?
