Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2012) Within the Commission, about 10 000 payments are made each year by the six Directorates Generals and three Agencies that are dealing with payment of grants from the sixth and seventh Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (FP6, 2002‑06 — FP7, 2007‑13), and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework programme (CIP). The large majority have been made on time, according to the contract/grants, within 45 days for pre-financing after the signature of the contract/grant (90 days for FP6 interim & final payments or 105 days for FP7 interim & final payments). These payment times combine the regulatory time allowed for approval of scientific progress reports and the time for verification and payment of cost claims. In case payments are not made within this time limits, the beneficiary is entitled to claim interest. The Commission has taken different types of actions to reduce the payments delays, e.g.: Appropriate trainings for the staff; Improvement of the IT systems for the management of the grants; Simplification of the administrative tasks and documents requested from the consortia (for FP7 and Horizon 2020, compared to FP6 and FP5); More efficient and effective communication with the consortia (e.g. Participant Portal); Regular monitoring of the open claims by each DG. As regards possible reasons for delays in payments, cost claims require in certain cases further analysis in order to ensure legality and regularity of payments. The respect of the time limits requires that beneficiaries submit all the necessary justification documents in due time, which is not always the case. Delays of payments are often occurring at the level of coordinators who do not transfer the payments in due time to the other contractors.
