Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (30 March 2009) Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20 February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, OJ L 58, 28.2.2006. stipulates that in order to benefit from aid under the temporary restructuring fund for the sugar industry, a company has to make an application to renounce part or the total of the sugar quota held, either in connection with the full or partial dismantling of one or several production sites or without any dismantling of production facilities. While the full dismantling of a factory is eligible for 100 % of the restructuring aid, the amount falls to 75 % in the case of partial dismantling and to 35 % if only the quota is renounced. Each application for restructuring aid has to include a restructuring plan detailing all actions and measures foreseen, which also has to contain a technical description of the facilities concerned, a financial plan, a social plan and an environmental plan. It is up to the Member State, when assessing the eligibility of the restructuring plan, to determine if all legal requirements are met. In order to qualify for the aid for full or partial dismantling under the temporary restructuring fund, a factory has to be in full working order and has to have a production capacity which corresponds at least to the amount of quota the company wants to renounce with the full or partial dismantling of the factory in question. If a factory has not been operational in the marketing year before the application for restructuring aid is made, the competent authorities of the Member State concerned have to take appropriate measures to verify that the above criteria are met. The competent authorities of the United Kingdom (UK) have taken the view that the best proof of the good working order of the production facilities is the production of a certain amount of sugar in the factory concerned, rather than a verification of technical plans and an inspection of the factory site while it is not in operation. Therefore, the two days of sugar production in the York factory are not inconsistent with EU policy, but are rather due to the UK authorities' wish to establish without any possible doubt that the factory in question fulfils the eligibility criteria for aid for full dismantling under the temporary restructuring fund for the sugar industry.
