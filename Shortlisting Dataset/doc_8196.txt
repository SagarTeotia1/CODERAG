WRITTEN QUESTION E-4459/06 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (19 October 2006) Subject: Transfer of end-of-service payments to an INPS pension fund (Italy) A few days ago the Italian Government proposed, as part of the financial procedure for 2007, a measure providing for the transfer of 65 % of an employee's mandatory end-of-service payment to a fund managed by the INPS (National Institute for Social Benefits). This new rule, in particular, states that as from 1 January 2007 an employee who has not yet joined a complementary pension scheme will have to decide within six months whether or not to put the end-of-service payment into a pension fund. In the absence of instructions from the employee, it will be presumed as of 1 July 2007 that silence means consent, and the payment will automatically be transferred to the pension fund. In the absence of a decision by the employee, the employer will be obliged to transfer the end-of-service payment into a new fund, set up for that purpose and managed by the INPS. This is an expedient by which the Italian Government intends to finance certain public projects, in which the INPS would invest the resources from the fund, while recovering, as cover, the entire sum of EUR 5 billion corresponding to the fund itself. This is a totally unprecedented measure, both because it amounts to the confiscation of money that is the workers' property, set aside on the basis of a voluntary contractual agreement between the employers' associations and the trade unions, and from the viewpoint of the procedures for covering public debt. Beyond the ingenious financial artifice, the real intention is to use money belonging to the workers to pay for the debt. Does the Commission believe that this measure is compatible with the legislation on reducing the public debt and with the Eurostat provisions?
