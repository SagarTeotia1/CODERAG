News Report : 12-01-2005 Brussels, 12 January 2005 MEPs approve € 100 million to aid tsunami victims On Tuesday evening the Budgets Committee approved €100 million in EU funding to enable the European Union to contribute to the humanitarian aid effort for victims of the tsunami of 26 December. The EU is thus responding swiftly to the appeal launched by the United Nations. It has taken less than twenty-four hours for the Council and Parliament to approve this funding, which comes from the Community budget's emergency reserve. The money will be available from next week, as soon as the finance ministers have formally noted the Budgets Committee's decision. The amount of €100 million is in addition to the €23 million already provided by the EU in the hours immediately after the disaster. The EU's contribution to the reconstruction of the region is expected to be followed up by further funding of €350 million over several years.
