Question for written answer E-005950/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Patrick Le Hyaric (GUE/NGL) (20 June 2011) Subject: Israeli army attack on protesters in the Syrian zone of the Golan Heights On 5 June 2011, in the separation zone in the Syrian part of the Golan Heights, several dozen people were killed and more than 300 were injured when Israeli soldiers opened fire on protesters attempting to cross the line separating Syria from Israel to reach the Golan plateau during a day of protests to mark the 44th anniversary of the Six-Day War — or ‘Naksa’ — in 1967, when Israel occupied territories belonging to Syria. The UN secretary-general has condemned the use of violence and any actions that led to its use, whereas the USA has expressed ‘grave concern’ and called for all parties to remain calm following this new outbreak of violence in the Golan Heights. 1. Under what conditions could an association or cooperation agreement between the European Union and a third country be frozen or even suspended? 2. Does the Commission intend to review its association and cooperation agreements with Israel? Have there been meetings in the past few months with a view to revising the EU‑Israel association agreement? 3. Does the Commission not think that agreements and trade concerning military hardware and weapons with Israel should be frozen?
