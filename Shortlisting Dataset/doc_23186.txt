Question for written answer E-010034/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (7 December 2010) Subject: Cocaine: twofold increase in deaths According to the ‘2010 Annual report’ of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, cocaine remains, after cannabis, the second most frequently used illicit substance in Europe. It is estimated that about 14 million Europeans have tried it at least once in their lives: this figure is equivalent to an average of 4.1 % of adults in the 15 to 64 age group. The health consequences of taking cocaine are, however, often underestimated: regular use can be associated with cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric problems, a higher risk of accidents, increased transmission of infective diseases through unprotected sex, and even death from overdose. The latest figures are alarming: in 2008 alone the number of deaths, having stood at 500 in 2007, doubled to 1 000. Given that the resulting social and health costs to the Member States are very high and probably rising as cocaine use increases, how will the Commission tackle the problem? Will it promote an information campaign to make European citizens aware of the health risks entailed in cocaine use?
