Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (31 March 2008) There was no specific amount of EU funding allocated to the Irish authorities to compensate fishermen directly affected by Council Regulation (EC) No 894/97, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1239/98 Council Regulation (EC) No 1239/98 of 8 June 1998 amending Regulation (EC) No 894/97 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources, OJ L 171, 17.6.1998. of 8 June 1998, banning the use of drift-nets for the fishing of large pelagic species (including albacore tuna) from 1 January 2002. According to Council Decision 1999/27/EC Council Decision 1999/27/EC of 17 December 1998 on a specific measure to encourage diversification out of certain fishing activities and amending Decision 97/292/EC, OJ L 8, 14.1.1999. of 17 December 1998, compensation could be paid under the 1994 to 1999 FIFG (financial instrument for fisheries guidance) programme for Ireland. However, Member States wishing to pay compensation had to draw up conversion plans. Ireland did not submit a conversion plan to the Commission and so did not pay compensation to fishermen affected by this ban.
