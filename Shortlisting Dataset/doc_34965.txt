Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (7 July 2003) Belgium may obtain a financial contribution from the Community up to 50 % of the expenditure for emergency measures as detailed in Article 3 (1) of Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 OJ L 224, 18.8.1990 . , on expenditure in the veterinary field that are provisions to eradicate and control the epidemics. The Community guidelines for State aid in the agriculture sector OJ C 232, 12.8.2000 . apply to all State aids granted in connection with activities related to the production, processing and marketing of Annex I products. State aid measures relating to outbreaks of animal diseases are to be assessed under the provisions of section 11 of these guidelines. While section 11 allows aids to compensate for damage to agricultural production or the means of agricultural production, it does not allow support to compensate processors. Where processors are in financial difficulties, however, rescue and restructuring aid may be possible provided that the relevant provisions of the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty OJ C 288, 9.10.1999 . are complied with. Moreover, the Commission has already emphasised insurance policies as a mean to deal with indirect losses caused by large outbreaks of animal diseases.
