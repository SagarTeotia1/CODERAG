calls on Mr Bangemann to reverse his decision to take up a post with Telefonica; 2. Calls on all other outgoing members of the Santer Commission to respect voluntarily the new Code of Conduct; 3. Calls on the Prodi Commission to ensure that the provisions of the Code of Conduct it adopted on 17 July 1999, in particular with regard to the declaration of financial interests, the prohibition on accepting payments from third parties, the provisions on accepting private sector posts after leaving office, and the establishment of a Committee on Standards in Public Life are enforced strictly and with the utmost rigour; 4. Calls on the Commission and Council to ensure that Article 213 of the EC Treaty is strictly complied with and enforced in relation to Mr Bangemann; in this respect gives its full support to the Council decision to refer to the European Court of Justice the case of Mr Bangemann who should have been led, by the duty of discretion deriving from his responsibilities, to refuse the duties he has agreed to exercise in 'Telefónica' and, clearly, not to apply for a post involving a sphere of activities covered by his portfolio as Commissioner; 5. Calls upon the next Intergovernmental Conference to consider revising Article 213 to ensure that the provisions on Commissioners taking up posts after they have ceased to hold office are made more clear and precise and correspond to the highest possible standards in public life; 6.
