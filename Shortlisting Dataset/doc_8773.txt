Question for written answer E-007354/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kinga Göncz (S&D) (26 July 2011) Subject: European pensioner's card In the Member States of the European Union, senior citizens can claim and enjoy various advantages and rights on presentation of a pensioner’s identity card. The Commission has a system for mapping existing advantages and rights for pensioners with regard to accessing various goods and services, and the conditions of access to them. — Does the Commission plan to propose a pilot project, building on the existing mapping exercise? — How does the Commission intend to update the information gathered through the mapping exercise? The fact is that, in the context of the diversity of Member States’ benefit and service systems, and because the cards being issued vary widely, senior citizens’ rights in a number of areas are often infringed (e.g. with regard to participation in social and cultural life, access to services and the availability of specific benefits). — Does the Commission intend to create an informative website, targeting older people to explain the rights and advantages they enjoy when travelling in other Member States? With regard, in particular, to the European Year of Active Ageing and Intergenerational Solidarity in 2012, it is important to know what the Commission plans to do in order to afford European pensioners equal access to the benefits and services available in the various Member States. — Does the Commission intend to propose that Member States issue a standardised pensioner’s identity card — which could potentially contribute to helping Europeans maintain an active lifestyle?
