Question for written answer E-002632/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (7 March 2012) Subject: Candidate status for Serbia Serbia is taking its first steps towards the European Union. After two years of waiting, the Heads of State or Government of the 27 existing Member States decided to grant Belgrade candidate status. The decision comes after difficult negotiations, slowed by the threat of veto from Romania, which requested protection for the Vlach minority living in Serbia. Serbia’s progress was facilitated by new agreements with Kosovo, in particular Belgrade’s substantive recognition of the latter, achieved through dialogue mediated by the European Union. The decision does not make everyone happy in Belgrade. On Wednesday, ultra-nationalists took to the streets to protest against the application and announced that they have already collected 200 000 signatures to avoid what they see as a catastrophic solution. In the light of the above, can the Commission state: 1. what increased benefits will Serbia’s possible accession to the European Union offer; 2. whether a date has already been set for Serbia's full entry into the EU, and the major issues pending for which Serbia has yet to improve its performance before it can be accepted?
