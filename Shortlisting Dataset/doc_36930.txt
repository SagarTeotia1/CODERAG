Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (28 September 2004) The Commission fully shares the Honourable Members’ concerns regarding the need for effective protection of the health and safety of health-care workers against all work-related risks, including infections which may be transmitted as a result of accidents involving needles and other medical sharps. Accordingly, the Commission refers the Honourable Members to its answer to their Written Question E-4041/03 and reminds them that it is conducting an ongoing analysis of the various ways of improving existing measures to protect the health and safety of workers at Community level. In particular, the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work, the tripartite body which advises the Commission OJ C 218, 13.9.2003 . , has set up a working group to examine the problems relating to health and safety at work in the hospital sector. In the course of its deliberations, the Advisory Committee may issue an opinion on initiatives which could be taken in this field at Community level. Once the Advisory Committee has adopted an opinion, the Commission will examine it very carefully, together with the information available from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work on the health and safety of health-care workers, and any other relevant information and studies in this field, before proposing specific initiatives.
