Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (7 June 2011) In relation to the applicable EU environmental law, it should be noted that directive 85/337/EEC Directive 85/337/EEC (OJ L 175, 5.7.1985) as amended by Directive 97/11/EC (OJ L 073, 14.3.1997), Directive 2003/35/EC (OJ L 156, 25.6.2003) and Directive 2009/31/EC (OJ L 140, 5.6.2009). as amended (known as the Environmental Impact Assessment or EIA Directive) makes provisions for the carrying out of an EIA for certain public and private projects. Annex I of the directive includes in point 7b) ‘Construction of motorways and express roads’, and in point 7c) ‘Construction of a new road of four or more lanes, or realignment and/or widening of an existing road of two lanes or less so as to provide four or more lanes, where such new road, or realigned and/or widened section of road would be 10 km or more in a continuous length’. In these cases, an EIA is mandatory. The other ‘Road projects’ are covered by point 10e) of Annex II of the EIA Directive. The EIA procedure ensures that environmental consequences of projects are identified and assessed before authorisation is given by the competent authority (know as the development consent). The public can give its opinion and all the consultations must be taken into consideration. The public should also be informed of the content of the development consent. Regarding the EU Nature Directives (the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC Directive 2009/147/EC (OJ L 20, 26.1.2010) that codifies Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (OJ L 103, 25.4.1979). and the Habitats Directive 92/43/ECC Directive 92/43/EEC on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora (OJ L 206, 22.7.1992). ), they would be applicable if the project in question could have a significant effect on any site belonging to the Natura 2000 network. According to the available information, however, this project would not seem to affect any Natura 2000 site. The Commission would like to stress that the layout of a project and the choice of a specific alternative remains the responsibility of the Member State concerned which has to ensure the compliance of the relevant EU legislation. It is foreseen that the IP8 road project will be financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the framework of the Portuguese National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) for the current programming period 2007‑13. The financing is foreseen within the priority axis VII (‘Infra-estruturas para a conectividade territorial’ — infrastructures for territorial connection). The Commission has not as yet received any formal application for the financing of this major project (total cost above EUR 50 million). When an application is received, the compliance with all EU regulations and rules will be checked.
