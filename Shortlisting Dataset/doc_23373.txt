such issues, something he said was going on via the Financial Stability Forum. An "ongoing market correction" Was the worst of the current financial market crisis over, asked Wolf Klinz (ALDE, DE)? "The present situation is of an ongoing process of very significant market correction with episodes of turbulence, a high level of volatility and overshooting. This market correction is ongoing" said the ECB President. Robert Goebbels (PES, LU) contrasted the ECB's holding of interest rates with the cuts made by the Federal Reserve in the US. He spoke of the ECB providing "unlimited liquidity" to banks – was this not encouraging further debt by assuring banks that they could always rely on the ECB, when a cut in interest rates might have helped both the financial sector as necessary and the wider economy? Mr Trichet strongly disagreed: "If we had reduced rates for a reason other than maintaining price stability, we would in effect have been asking our fellow citizens to subsidise the banks via their suffering from inflation." He noted that the ECB and the Fed were operating in different environments, facing different shocks in different economies. Inflation and purchasing power Noting that the ECB's projections showed inflation above its target in the months ahead, John Purvis (EPP-ED. UK) asked whether other factors were now influencing interest rate decisions. "Resolutely no," said Mr Trichet. "If we have maintained rates at their present level, it is because we believe this level corresponds to what is necessary to deliver price stability in the medium term... We have only one needle in our compass." Donatella Gottardi (PES, IT) asked what could be done to maintain people's purchasing power and prevent the emergence of more "working poor". Mr Trichet stressed that in normal time pay rises should be linked to improving productivity. But in times of external price shocks the economy had to adjust to transferring more to external suppliers. "Once that higher price is there, if you do not accept it as the price it is, you are paving the way for an inflationary spiral and increasing unemployment... Mass unemployment in Europe started after a very bad policy reaction to the first oil price shock in the 70s." 2008-03-25 Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs In the chair Pervenche Berès PES FR Monetary Dialogue with the European Central Bank 20080325IPR24801 The full text of Mr Trichet's opening statement is available from the ECB website Before each session of Monetary Dialogue, a panel of expert advisors prepares detailed analyses of current issues facing the ECB.
