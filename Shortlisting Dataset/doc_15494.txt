Romania (EU-2) on 1 January 2007). These numbers are complemented by 50 external staff (30 for EU-10 and 20 for EU-2) according to PDB document I (page 41). The request is in line with the multi-annual plan on enlargement needs presented by the Commission in its communication "Activities and human resources of the Commission in the enlarged European Union" COM(2002) 311 final of 5 June 2002 for the period 2003-2008 (+700 posts in 2006, +700 in 2005 and +780 in 2004). In addition to them 13 new posts devoted to the recruitment of the specialists needed in the legal and linguistic departments following the change in status of the Irish language are requested. 87. As regards the other needs in staff, the Commission, as last year, has made an effort to limit the financial implication by redeploying the posts between DGs (245 posts) and within the DGs (340 posts). 88. The reinforcement of the security in the buildings of the Commission in Brussels and in the delegations represents the lion's share of the remaining requested increase in Heading 5 (+10.6% according to PDB document I, page 44). The installation of security gates in all buildings at headquarters is intended for the first year of a four year programme and should generate significant savings in insurance and security personnel costs. In the delegations, reinforcement in security is needed according to the risk attached to the country where the delegation is based. This is especially high in the Balkans and, potentially, in Iraq where the Commission has the intention to open a delegation by the end of 2006. The cost foreseen in the PDB for this single delegation is roughly EUR 7 million including rent of office and body-guards for the staff. 89. In order to encourage the Commission's staff to use public transport, the Commission has decided to reimburse half of the price of public transport for staff who commute and renounce the use of the parking facilities. This will represent an increase of 622.2% relative to the minimal spending in this regard in previous budgets. Heading 6 - Compensation 90. The PDB proposes to budget nearly the full amount available, that is EUR 444,6 million out of a total of EUR 445 million. For 2007, Heading 6 covers the Cash-Flow facility and the Schengen facility (for financing control actions at the new external borders of the Union), agreed during the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania. Horizontal issues Agencies 91. PDB 2007 includes appropriations for 23 decentralised agencies European Agency for Reconstruction and EU Translation Centre only have p.m. entries in the PDB 2007 and have been excluded from this comparison for a total amount of EUR 417,6 million which is an increase of nearly 18% as compared to the agencies' budget of 342,7 million in 2006. The vast bulk of expenditure on agencies falls under Heading 1 where around 50% of the total agencies' budget for 2007 is concentrated. 37% of the total amount is planned for agencies under Heading 3, whereas Heading 2, with 8%, and Heading 4, with 5%,
