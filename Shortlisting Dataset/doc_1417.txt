WRITTEN QUESTION E-3245/07 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (28 June 2007) Subject: Leprosy and tuberculosis The media have recently been reporting increasingly frequent cases of leprosy and tuberculosis discovered in EU Member States, with carriers generally coming in from third countries. These diseases had disappeared from our countries a long time ago and seemed to have been conquered definitively. The health authorities claim to have the situation under control, but leprosy and TB arouse fear in people's minds. 1. Does the Commission have data on the incidence of these diseases in the Member States of the Union? 2. If so, can it say what countries the people affected come from? 3. Does it not consider that strict health controls should be introduced at European level for people who come from the areas at risk and travel within Europe? 4. What measures will it take in the context of immigration policies to avoid risks and prevent the spread of these two diseases?
