Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (25 June 2009) 1. The Commission is committed to promoting gender equality in decision-making positions, to raising awareness of the gender gap in this area, in particular by collecting comparable data at EU level through its database on women and men in decision-making. That is why the Commission's Roadmap for Equality between women and men (2006-2010) http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=422&langId=en lists equal participation in decision-making by women and men as one of its priorities. Regular reports analysing the situation and trends in women and men in top decision-making positions are prepared and disseminated widely to stimulate debate on this issue, and a European network to promote women in decision-making was set up in 2008 to act as a European platform for exchange of best practice in this area http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=418&langId=en . Since 2009 is an important year for politics and for women in Europe, in January 2009 the Commission published a report ‘Women in European politics — time for action’ http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/publications/booklets/equality/pdf/ke8109543_en.pdf , covering in particular the gender balance in politics at all levels. The Commission warmly encourages the Member States to promote a gender balance more effectively in decision-making positions, including by appointing more women to the high-profile posts that will need to be filled in the EU institutions. In addition, action has been taken under the Commission's communication policy to target the female electorate: this includes a Eurobarometer special survey http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/index_en.htm on women's perception of the EU, a brochure ‘Europe for Women“ http://ec.europa.eu/publications/booklets/others/80/index_en.htm explaining EU activities of special interest to women, a press pack http://europa.eu/press_room/index_en.htm for journalists, and other information and communication events. 2. Data on women and men in high decision-making positions in the political, public, legal, social and economic fields are available in the Commission's database on women and men in decision-making http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/women_men_stats/measures_in4_en.htm and in the abovementioned reports. Furthermore, the Commission has implemented a policy of equal opportunities for its staff since 1988 through its Action Programmes (AP) for women. In 2004 it adopted the fourth AP for Equal Opportunities for women and men (2004‑08), which aims mainly to improve the gender balance among staff at all levels, to remove barriers to the career development of women and to reconcile work, family and private life. The fourth AP has been extended to the end of 2009; it is currently being evaluated and a fifth AP will be based on it. Since 1995 the Commission has set annual targets, subject to annual monitoring, for the recruitment and appointment of women to management and AD category (non-management) posts with the aim of achieving gender parity at all levels. The targets are applicable to new recruitments and first appointments to management posts within the Commission, including those of heads of delegation. Specific actions have also been implemented to encourage women to apply for management posts, and to develop their management potential, in particular by training. The situation in delegations is more problematic: despite a slight increase over the past few years, only 8.3 % of women currently occupy management posts. The fourth Action Programme explicitly provides
