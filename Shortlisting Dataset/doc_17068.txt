Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision. OJ L 235, 23.9.2003 . requires the protection of scheme members by separating the assets of the sponsoring undertaking from those of the pension fund. This Directive stipulates that the Member State should require that the pension institution has ‘at all times sufficient and appropriate assets to cover the technical provisions in respect of the total range of pension schemes operated’ (Article 16). In case the institutions operating the pension schemes underwrite the liability to cover against biometric risk, or guarantee a given investment performance or a given level of benefits, these institutions should hold on a permanent basis additional assets above the technical provisions to serve as a buffer (Article 17). Competent authorities may restrict or prohibit the free disposal of the institution's assets in case the institutions have failed to establish sufficient technical provisions in respect of the entire business or has insufficient assets to cover the technical provision (Article 14, paragraph 2, under a). Moreover, in case the institution fails to protect adequately the interests of members and beneficiaries, the competent authorities may prohibit or restrict the activities of an institution located in their territories (Article 14, paragraph 4, under a). The Directive has to be implemented by the Member States at the latest by 23 September 2005 and is therefore not yet applicable in the case referred to by the Honourable Member. Finally, the financial liability of holding companies in third countries vis-à-vis their subsidiaries in the European Union will depend on national law.
