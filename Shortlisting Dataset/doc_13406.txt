pre-accession aid, the annual volume of pre-accession assistance to Turkey has been gradually increasing since 2002 (€126 million), and is expected to reach some €500 million by the end of the current financial perspective in 2006. While the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013 still remains to be agreed, the Commission has, in its proposal of 29 September 2004 for a Council Regulation establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance COM(2004) 627 final proposed that future Candidate Countries should be treated broadly the same as past candidate countries. For Turkey, taking into account the size and absorption capacity of the country, it is proposed that there will be a gradual increase in assistance over the period 2007-2013 towards the level of per capita assistance established in the financial perspective 2000-2006, under heading 7, for the 10 Candidate Countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
