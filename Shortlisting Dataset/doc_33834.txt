WRITTEN QUESTION E-2611/07 by Antonio Tajani (PPE‑DE) and Giuseppe Gargani (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 May 2007) Subject: Red coral: protection of workers in the sector At the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) meeting of 24 July 1987, the proposal to restrict the trade in red coral was rejected by 10 votes to 2. The US delegation voted against. From 27 to 30 September 1988 the FAO held a technical consultation on Mediterranean coral, at which it concluded that there was no need for special protectionist measures and merely suggested that the reefs be used on a rotation basis. The current US proposal to include red coral in CITES Annex II runs contrary to the 1987 decision. It is also inappropriate and unclear as regards the arguments used to justify the proposal. It considers that the reduction in red coral fishing since 1994 is due to the alleged suffering of the species, ignoring the basic fact that red coral fishing by trawl-nets was prohibited throughout the Mediterranean following a decision adopted by the European Community in that year. In proposal No 21 of fisheries report No 833 (26-30 March 2007), the FAO concludes that the evidence available does not justify the proposal to include all Corallium species in CITES Annex II, given that the trends identified in the available data do not show any real decline in the species. On the contrary, the FAO has noted that a significant proportion of the Corallium rubrum production is used in international and national trade and that this trade is an important factor in catches of the species. In Torre del Greco (Italy), some 4 000 families work in this sector and the inclusion of this species in Annex II would have extremely serious repercussions on local economic conditions and would deprive the region of one of its long-standing socio-cultural features. How does the Commission intend to protect the rights, interests and jobs of all these European citizens?
