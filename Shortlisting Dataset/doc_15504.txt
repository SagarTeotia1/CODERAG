Source: Council Draft Budget explanatory memorandum 3. The rapporteur highlights that the "difference from 2006 budget %" columns in table 1 are not based on a like-for-like comparison since the DB 2007 is for EU 27 (including Romania and Bulgaria), whereas the 2006 budget is for the current EU 25. This reduces the transparency as regards proposed spending in the 2007 budget. The rapporteur requests that the Commission should present data on the budgetary costs and needs of Bulgaria and Romania separately in order to facilitate fair and accurate comparisons with earlier budgets. 4. In the DB, the Council has reduced the total commitment appropriations to € 125 756 million Taking into account the final draft estimates of the institutions other than the Commission, the rectified PDB amounts to € 126 776 million in commitments and € 116 370 million in payments. . This is a cut of € 1 020 million from € 126 776 million in the updated PDB 2007. As usual in its 1st reading the Council has focused in particular on cutting the payments budget as compared to the PDB. Whereas the revised PDB had total payments at € 116 370 million, in the DB they stand at € 114 613 million. Total payments thus fall by 1,5 % to a level of 0.98% of EU GNI. Given that Annex I of the 17 May 2006 inter-institutional agreement (IIA) sets a ceiling of 1.06 % of EU GNI, there is significant headroom within the payments budget relative to the DB figures. The rapporteur does not consider that the level of payments in the DB will be sufficient to meet the policy challenges that the EU faces. 5. Table 2 compares the margins remaining under the MFF ceilings in light of the DB relative to the margins that were available under the revised PDB. The ceilings are taken from table 2 of the annex to the Commission communication (2006) 327 of 22.6.2006, which updates the MFF figures
