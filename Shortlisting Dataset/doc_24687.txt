establish other particular ways and means of ensuring appropriate information for children-consumers; 14. Stresses that the link between the strategy's integrated monitoring and response system and the proposal for a regulation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals - REACH, ( COM(2003) 644 ), which will provide toxicological and exposure data, needs to be clarified and strengthened in the strategy; points out that current risk assessment methodologies do not specifically consider foetuses, infants and children and the wide range of exposure patterns that exist within this population; 15. Calls on the Commission to request an opinion from its Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment to evaluate whether the current REACH proposal will provide adequate protection for children from exposure to harmful chemicals, in particular from articles; 16. Considers that the anticipated biomonitoring should include certain pesticides as well as certain brominated flame retardants and phthalates so as to cover substances that are not yet adequately regulated; 17. Recommends that the action plan include legislative proposals to reduce the dependency on pesticides in the context of the thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides; 18. Stresses the importance of education about environmental health; calls for the methods and activities to be undertaken for raising awareness to be better defined in the strategy; considers that the objective should be to inform each individual sufficiently so as to enable him or her to make the appropriate choices in relation to his or her own health; emphasises the crucial role of public access to information in this context; calls on the Commission to ensure that all evidence about environmental degradation that could harm health, in particular children's health, be made publicly available; calls specifically for the creation of publicly accessible registers on geographical mapping of major emissions on the one hand, and major diseases on the other hand; 19. Calls for the precautionary principle to be included in the strategy and for the action plan to include a list of environmental contaminants, for which there is a sufficient level of scientific evidence at the effect level (e.g. molecular, cellular, or tissue-related) to show that potentially serious or irreversible health impacts are likely; 20. Calls on the Commission to accelerate the pilot project 'Integrated monitoring of dioxins & PCBs in the Baltic region' and to start to use this integrated information as a basis for developing new policies without delay; 21. Recommends that climate change and its health implications be addressed as a priority issue in the Community action plan and that measures to assess, prevent, reduce and mitigate the health impacts of climate change be proposed, using appropriate EU legislative instruments; 22. 22 Recommends that the Action Plan take into specific consideration the problem of passive smoking, in particular at the work place and in public buildings, and include legislative proposals to restrict smoking to dedicated closed rooms at the work place, as well as conduct an awareness campaign to inform the public of the effects of tobacco pollution on children's health; 23. Underlines that putting in place a Community monitoring
