Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2011) 1. In line with the rules of shared management, as defined in Council Regulation 1083/2006, the monitoring of the implementation of all operational programmes under the Greek National Strategic Reference Framework 2007-2013 (NSRF) is assured by the Greek authorities and the relevant Commission services. For the ‘Human Resources Development’ Operational Programme co-funded by the European Social Fund the relevant Commission service is DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. In the field of Cohesion Policy, the mandate assigned by the President of the Commission to the Task Force for Greece (TFGR) is to recommend legislative, regulatory, administrative and if necessary (re)programming measures for an accelerated take-up of EU funds, in close cooperation with the relevant Commission services, the Greek authorities and the EIB, focusing on competitiveness, growth and employment/training. 2. The TFGR together with the relevant Commission services is working closely with the Greek authorities to identify and agree the measures and support needed to speed up the implementation of high quality projects funded under the NSRF.
