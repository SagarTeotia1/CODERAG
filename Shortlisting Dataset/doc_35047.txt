WRITTEN QUESTION E-6617/09 by Anna Záborská (PPE) to the Commission (13 January 2010) Subject: Irregularities relating to the recognised geographical indications for Tokaj in the E-Bacchus database, affecting Slovak wine producers Examination of the E-Bacchus database, which has been available to the public on the Internet since 1 August 2009, reveals a number of irregularities relating to the recognised geographical indications for Tokaj (in Slovakia, ‘Tokaj’; in Hungary, ‘Tokaji’. Can the Commission: 1. clarify to what extent the Slovak national classification, as laid down in national law No 182‑2005 (in force up to 31 July 2009) authorising the designation ‘Tokaj’ for wines of recognised geographical origin in Slovakia, has been recognised as the national basis for the creation of E-Bacchus; 2. summarise the course of the negotiations on assigning the recognised geographical indication ‘Tokaj’, especially in the context of the remarks submitted by Hungary and Slovakia; 3. summarise the terms in which the Slovak government has insisted on preserving the recognised geographical indication ‘Tokaj’ for wines produced in Slovakia; 4. indicate the grounds on which it has refused to allow Slovakia to register the term ‘Tokaj’ as a recognised geographical indication, with the result that Tokaj wine is now classified under the heading ‘Tokajská vinohradnícka oblas’ (Tokaj wine-producing region); 5. explain its reasons for recognising the geographical indication ‘Tokaj’ for wines produced in Hungary when these were initially classified under the heading ‘Tokaji, Tokaji borvidék’; 6. confirm that what is involved is a usurpation of a recognised geographical indication and, therefore, a distortion of competition adversely affecting Slovak wine producers?
