WRITTEN QUESTION P-2107/04 by Roberto Musacchio (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 September 2004) Subject: Environmental impact assessment for medium-wave broadcasting station in Blera On 31 May 2004, Rai Way SpA applied to the municipal authorities in Blera (Viterbo) for permission to build a medium-wave broadcasting station with a radiated power of 600 kW on a piece of agricultural land at Civitella Cesi. The project was to involve the construction of a 180 metres high guyed antenna tower and four reinforced concrete buildings to house equipment, with a total volume of 5372 cubic metres. The application covers the purchase of seven hectares of what is designated as agricultural land under the current land-use plan and is subject to hydrogeological restrictions under the terms of Decree 3267/1923 and Decree 1126/1926 as subsequently amended, and the taking out of a building lease on a further 300 hectares in order to ensure that no housing is built in the surrounding area, in compliance with the precautionary limits placed on exposure to electromagnetic fields by Ministerial Decree 381/98. Owing to the power radiated by the guyed tower, which is braced by five rows of metal guys arranged on three levels at a spacing of 120 degrees, no one may remain within a one-kilometre radius of it for more than four hours per day. The Blera municipal authorities have temporarily suspended the processing of Rai Way SpA's application in the absence of the necessary authorisation from the regional water authorities for building work to be carried out in an area subject to hydrogeological restrictions and of the authorisations provided for in Law 349/86 and the land-use plan of 12 April 1996. Given the above and owing to the high levels of electromagnetic pollution generated (which have been acknowledged by the applicants themselves), would the Commission check that this project complies with current EU legislation seeking to protect the public against electromagnetic fields? Would it not agree that a detailed environmental impact assessment should be produced in accordance with Directives 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 . , 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5 . and 2001/42/EC OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p. 30 . ?
