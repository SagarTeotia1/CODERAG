Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2010) The Commission is aware that the current system of ‘cascade’ as defined in Article 11 of Directive 2001/82/EC Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products, OJ L 311, 28.11.2001. may have certain strengths and weaknesses. The Commission is currently preparing an impact assessment to support a legal proposal for amending the legal framework for veterinary medicinal products. In this context, a public consultation was launched with the closing date of 15 July 2010. In the consultation one of the key issues, the subjects on which the Commission specifically invited interested parties to provide a contribution, was the ‘cascade’. A summary of the outcome of the consultation will be published and the input will be utilised for preparing the legal proposal.
