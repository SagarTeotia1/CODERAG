operations and partners. For the Occupied Palestinian Territories OPT (both West Bank and Gaza), in addition to a general evaluation in 2004, the operations of two major partners, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) (2006) and United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) (2008) have been evaluated. — DG ECHO-funded activities implemented by the humanitarian organisations are subject to financial audit. DG ECHO's audit strategy is based on a 2‑track approach: audits are performed both at the DG ECHO partners' headquarters on a cyclical basis for finalised projects and in the field for ongoing projects. In this particular case DG ECHO audited almost one third of the expenditure claims made for humanitarian projects in the OPT. Beside the humanitarian aid provided by DG ECHO, the Commission also funds the supply of important quantities of fuel for the Gaza Power Plant under the PEGASE mechanism, implemented under the responsibility of DG EuropeAid. The invoices for the provision of fuel are settled directly with the Israeli supplier, and this is subject to rigorous checks on quantities delivered at the border crossing point (Nahal Oz) and on arrival at the Gaza Power Plant. In addition, the auditors also verify the consumption of the fuel in the plant itself. Direct payments to the supplier are only made following the reception of the reports from the auditors detailing the results of the abovementioned verifications.
