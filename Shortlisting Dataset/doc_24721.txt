Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (23 July 2007) The Commission would like to recall that, under the terms of the Fisheries partnership agreement between the European Community and Morocco, the Moroccan authorities are responsible for the programming of the financial contribution earmarked under the agreement to support the development of the fisheries sector. Morocco and the Commission will, however, undertake a joint assessment of the multi-annual programming and they will decide together on the indicators for the review of its implementation. As the agreement only entered into force in March 2007, work in this regard is still ongoing. These indicators will be examined during a Joint Committee session to be held in 2008. Support to coastal communities, including those of the Western Sahara, is one of the actions envisaged in the programming of support measures to be implemented under the agreement.
