environment and sustainable development 76. Calls on the Commission to take practical steps for the establishment of a 'European diplomacy on environment and sustainable development', and urges the Commission to put forward a specific strategy in this area; 77. Supports the Commission's aim of maintaining a leading role in building up a strong coalition for further post-Kyoto international commitments beyond 2012, not least because addressing climate change also brings opportunities and incentives for innovation in line with goals set by the Lisbon agenda; stresses the need to give economic decision-makers the opportunity to integrate certain reasonable indications on the likely situation after 2012 into their forward economic planning and to encourage the USA to bring forward its own proposals; Trade policy 78.
