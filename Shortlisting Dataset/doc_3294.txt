Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (2 October 2007) At the present moment, there is no payment due by the Commission to the Spanish authorities in the framework of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) part of the operational programme of Galicia for 1994‑99. The last and definitive payment was made in June 2007 and the ERDF part of the programme is now closed. The resolution of an infraction procedure about a project on the Uma River has allowed the final closure of this operational programme. The Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) Operational Programme for 1994‑99 is a national programme and it covers all Objective 1 regions in Spain. Payments are made to the Ministry of Finance and the Managing Authority of the operational programme (Ministry of Agriculture — Secretariat-General for Fisheries) is responsible for allocating amounts received between the Spanish autonomous communities. The Objective 1 programme has not yet been closed. The Commission and the Spanish national authorities have had a number of exchanges on the final closure of the programme. The Commission hopes to close the programme before the end of 2007. The difference between the net amount of the final request for payment and the amount already paid by the Commission is less than EUR 900000 .
