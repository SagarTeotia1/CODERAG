implementation of the Foundation's budget for the financial year 2005 Text Adopted, P6_TA(2007)0114 . , and in its resolution accompanying the discharge decision inter alia · invited the Foundation to pay greater attention to carry-overs in 2005 with respect to commitments for administrative expenditure (Title II) and operating activities (Title III), which remained high at 37 % and 44 % respectively; · invited the Foundation to present a work programme which expresses its contribution in operational and measurable terms; · expressed concern that there was in 2005 no comprehensive document analysing the risks arising from the financial and operational aspects of the Foundation's activities, nor a validation of procedures introduced by the Authorising Officers in order to ensure the accuracy and exhaustiveness of the financial information they sent to the Accounting Officer, except as regards data-processing aspects, General points which relate to horizontal issues affecting the EU agencies and which therefore also have a bearing on the discharge procedure for each individual agency 1. Notes that the budgets of the 24 agencies and other satellite bodies audited by the Court of Auditors totalled EUR 1 080,5 million in 2006 (the biggest being that of the European Agency for Reconstruction at EUR 271 million and the smallest being that of the European Police College (CEPOL) at EUR 5 million); 2. Points out that the range of external EU bodies subject to audit and discharge now includes not only traditional regulatory agencies but also executive agencies set up to implement specific programmes, and will in the near future also extend to joint undertakings set up as public-private partnerships (joint technology initiatives); 3. Observes as regards the Parliament that the number of agencies subject to the discharge procedure has evolved as follows: financial year 2000: 8; 2001: 10; 2002: 11; 2003: 14; 2004: 14; 2005: 16; 2006: 20 regulatory agencies and 2 executive agencies (not including 2 agencies which are audited by the Court of Auditors but subject to an internal discharge process); 4. Concludes therefore that the auditing / discharge process has become cumbersome and disproportionate compared to the relative size of the agencies' / satellite bodies' budgets; instructs its competent committee to undertake a wide-ranging review of the discharge process as regards agencies and satellite bodies with a view to devising a simpler and more rational approach, bearing in mind the ever-growing number of bodies each requiring a separate discharge report in future years; Fundamental considerations 5. Requests that the Commission provide clear explanations regarding the following elements before the creation of a new agency or reform of an existing agency: agency type, objectives of the agency, internal governance structure, products, services, key procedures, target group, clients and stakeholders of the agency, formal relationship with external actors, budget responsibility, financial planning, and personnel and staffing policy; 6. Requests that each agency be governed by a yearly performance agreement which is formulated by the agency and the responsible DG and which should contain the main objectives for the coming year, a financial framework and clear indicators to measure performance; 7. Requests that the performance
