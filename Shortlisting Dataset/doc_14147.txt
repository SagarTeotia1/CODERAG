Answer given by Mr Patten on behalf of the Commission (16 January 2003) China has traditionally used bear bile for medical purposes. Since the 1980's commercial bear farming has been used to obtain bile for traditional Chinese medicines. The Commission is aware that this practice arose because of increasing conservation concerns about the killing of wild bears for this purpose. Nevertheless, the Commission also shares the Honourable Member's concern over the possible implications of such a practice for animal welfare. The Union has one of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and public awareness regarding animal welfare is high. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of legislation has been adopted that covers a wide range of issues relating to animal well being. The Commission's policies promote the improved protection and respect for the welfare of animals as sentient beings, both internally and internationally, since it is of the opinion that high animal welfare standards must be ensured globally. The Community will continue to actively pursue substantive negotiations on animal welfare and is co-operating at the international level in order to improve animal welfare policies world-wide. To do so, it seeks to develop high multilateral standards within the framework of specific international conventions, mainly within the framework of the Council of Europe and the World Organisation for Animal Health.
