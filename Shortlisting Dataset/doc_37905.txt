Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (29 February 2008) As the Honourable Member correctly states, Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 OJ L 210, 31.7.2006. on a European grouping of territorial cooperation (EGTC) creates a new Community legal framework to promote cross-border, transnational and/or interregional cooperation involving the Member States with the aim of increasing economic and social cohesion. This regulation requires in its Article 16(1) Member States to take the necessary implementation measures and make such provisions as are appropriate to ensure the effective application of the regulation. The regulation entered into force on 1 August 2006, but applies only by 1 August 2007 (Article 18). Member States had until the latter date to inform the Commission and the other Member States of any provisions adopted under Article 16. Regrettably, many Member States have not yet complied with their obligations under the regulation. By 1 August 2007, only Germany had officially informed the Commission about some aspects of its provisions on national and Länder level. Two other Member States had their national provisions adopted by this date, without formally informing the Commission: Hungary (Act XCIX of 2007 adopted on 25 June 2007 by Parliament) and the United Kingdom (Statutory Instrument 2007 No 1949 which entered into force on 1 August 2007). As of today (7 February 2008), five other Member States have adopted their national provisions: Bulgaria (Decree No 199 of 29 August 2007 which entered into force on 4 September 2007), Portugal (Decreto-Lei No 376/200 which entered into force on 9 November 2007), Romania (Ordonanta de urgenta 127/2007 adopted by the Government on 12 November 2007, in the meantime confirmed by Parliament), Greece (a basic legislative act was adopted by Parliament and entered into force on 23 November 2007; however, an administrative decree with further details has still to be adopted later on) and Spain (Real Decreto 37/2008 of 18 January 2008, entered into force on 20 January 2008). A series of other Member States are quite advanced in the legislative process. The Commission has reminded all Member States to adopt their national provisions and signalled that these provisions will be examined in order to confirm that they respect the regulation. Concerning a central register of these groupings, Article 5(1) of the EGTC‑Regulation foresees that the members of an EGTC shall inform the Member States concerned and the Committee of the Regions of the convention and the registration and/or publication of the statutes. Further details are available on European grouping of territorial cooperation website of the Committee: http://www.cor.europa.eu/pages/EventTemplate.aspx?view=folder&id=1ae87373-d198-4bf5-b26c-7e9930fb813e&sm=1ae87373-d198-4bf5-b26c-7e9930fb813e Since 1 August 2007 the regulation is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. Consequently EGCT's can in principle be set up even without previous adoption of national provisions. This direct application enabled the setting-up on 28 January 2008 of the first European grouping of territorial cooperation ever, the ‘Eurométropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai’. This EGTC was formally set up by 14 partner institutions from parts of the French Département ‘Nord’ and parts of the Belgian regions of ‘West-Vlaanderen’ and ‘Hainaut’. The ‘Eurométropole’ will develop projects in the field
