Question for written answer P-4064/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Gianluca Susta (S&D) (3 June 2010) Subject: Request for derogation under Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 OJ L 409, 30.12.2006, p. 11. (known as the Mediterranean Regulation) is giving rise to serious concern about the future of thousands of small and medium-sized fishing enterprises in Italy. The justified desire to protect fish reserves is being thwarted by unfair competition from non-EU fishing boats operating in international waters off the coasts of Member States. Under the current rules, the use of trawl nets is prohibited within 1.5 nautical miles of the coast, but, by way of derogation, the use of such nets between 0.7 and 1.5 nautical miles off the coast may be authorised. Applying the 1.5 nautical mile rule in Liguria (Italy) means losing 798 km² out of a total of 1 100 km² of fishing grounds. However, if the derogation were to be applied, fishing would remain virtually unaffected. Liguria’s fisheries are already disadvantaged compared to other areas of the Mediterranean (one sixth of the size of the Adriatic’s fishing grounds). Would the Commission agree that this derogation should be granted at the earliest opportunity? The request was submitted some time ago and in accordance with the applicable rules.
