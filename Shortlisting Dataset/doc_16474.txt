independence, the Director General should be appointed for a term of five years, renewable once. "The Director General shall neither seek nor take instructions from any government or any institution, body, office or agency in the performance of his duties with regard to the opening and carrying out of external and internal investigations or to the drafting of reports following such investigations," the report says. Member States and EU institutions should report regularly to OLAF To improve the operational, legal and administrative framework for combating fraud, the Committee on Budgetary Control proposes that the competent authorities of Member States and the European institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should be required to report regularly to OLAF on progress made as regards action taken in response to the final investigation report issued by OLAF. Freedom of the press to be guaranteed To make it possible to provide objective information to European taxpayers and in order to guarantee freedom of the press, the report asks that "all EU bodies involved in the investigation respect the principle of protecting journalists' sources in accordance with national legislation". This amendment is made with reference to the "Tillack Affair", in which judicial abuses were committed against a German journalist who had revealed corruption in the operations of an EU agency. Respect for people's rights The report mentions the fundamental rights of the persons concerned by investigations, stating that they "should be respected at all times, particularly when providing information. There is a need to clarify the basic principles of OLAF's information policy.

The report from the Economics Committee gives Parliament’s views on the ECB, the Lisbon Strategy, the Stability and Growth Pact, external representation for the eurozone and financial services supervision, among other issues. The committee’s report, drawn up by Pervenche Berès (PES, FR, Chair of the Committee) and Werner Langen (EPP-ED, DE) stresses that euro has helped economic stability, but that more needs to be done to get most from the Economic and Monetary Union, including coordinated economic reforms as set out in the Lisbon Strategy. They stress the need to need to stick closely to the Stability and Growth Pact, and argue for more budgetary consolidation - but also efficient public spending. Price stability and inflation targeting MEPs in the committee say wage moderation should not be seen as the exclusive way to achieve price stability – in fact, real wages should rise in line with productivity levels. They strongly back the independence of the European Central Bank. When
