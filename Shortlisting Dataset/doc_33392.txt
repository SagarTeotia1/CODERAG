Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (23 January 2012) At the G20 summit in Cannes, G20 leaders agreed they will ensure that the IMF continues to have resources to play its systemic role to the benefit of its whole membership, and asked Finance Ministers to explore a range of various options. EU Member States support a substantial increase in the IMF's resources. These resources will enhance the IMF's capacity to fulfil its systemic responsibilities in support of its global membership, which is especially important given the ongoing economic slowdown and financial market tensions. Discussions on the increase in IMF resources have proved to be complex and various options have met with reservations from Members. The development of options to strengthen or maximise the capacity of the EFSF has, therefore, continued without assuming IMF participation. On 29 November 2011, the Eurogroup endorsed terms of reference for two options by which the capacity of the existing EFSF could be maximised. One of these two options entails the creation of one or more co-investment funds that would combine public and private funds; it was not, however, developed envisioning the participation of the IMF. On 19 December 2011, euro area Member States agreed, as part of a broader international effort to improve the adequacy of IMF resources to provide EUR 150 billion of additional resources through bilateral loans to the Fund's General Resources Account. The Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, and Sweden also indicated their willingness to take part in the process of reinforcing IMF resources. The UK indicated that it will define its contribution early in 2012 in the framework of the G20.
