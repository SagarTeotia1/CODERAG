Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (11 April 2008) The Commission is aware of the existence of the Valencia Wind Farm Plan and has requested information relating to its development from the Spanish authorities. According to the information available, the plan was subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment. The 15 zones into which it is divided were or will be submitted to an Environmental Impact Assessment procedure and a favourable Environmental Impact Declaration is needed before the wind farm projects approval. None of the wind farm projects will be located in any of the special protection areas for birds (SPAs) designated in the Autonomous Community of Valencia. Concerning the execution of the Judgment of the Court of Justice of 28 June 2007, in case C‑235/04, the Commission will verify the sufficiency of the designations and that the new SPAs perimeters are not illegally altered.
