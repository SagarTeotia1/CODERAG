Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) Article 17 of the Treaty on the European Union states the following: ‘The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide.’ While it is of course not for the Commission to respond to the substance of the statement referred to in the question the Commision notes that the statement seems to indicate that at least one Member State would not be ready to approve such a decision by the European Council.
