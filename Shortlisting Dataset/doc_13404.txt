9999/C Q999 E/105 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2163/03 by Joan Vallvé (ELDR) to the Commission (19 June 2003) Subject: European Union-Iraq relations The Catalan Football Federation had planned to hold a friendly international match on 25 June in Barcelona between the Catalan and Iraqi teams. The purpose of the match, as stated by the Federation President, was to help raise funds for the reconstruction of a country – Iraq – which has been devastated by war. According to media reports, the Spanish Foreign Ministry did not grant visas to the Iraqi players who were to take part in this match in Barcelona. Will the Commission look into the Spanish Government's reasons for preventing this football match between Catalunya and Iraq, which would doubtless have helped to improve relations and foster greater understanding between European citizens and the Iraqi people?
