Reply (10 October 2011) On 19 July 2011 the Council adopted 13055/11. the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of the fibre composition of textile products and repealing Council Directive 73/44/EEC and Directives 96/73/EC and 2008/121/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council PE-CONS 21/11. , as amended by the European Parliament at second reading. Concerning the indication of non-textile parts of animal origin pursuant to the new Article 12, which was raised in the Honourable Member's question, it should be pointed out that this amendment replicates an amendment already voted on by the European Parliament at its first reading. Any questions regarding an impact assessment or contact with interested parties should therefore be addressed to the European Parliament which is the source of this specific amendment. It is not for the Council to notify the World Trade Organisation of these measures, should that be considered necessary.
