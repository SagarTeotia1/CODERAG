Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (18 April 2008) Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) OJ L 105, 13.4.2006. establishes rules governing border control of persons crossing the external borders of Member States. As far as checks on the sea borders and in particular the ferry connections are concerned, the Schengen Borders Code in its Annex VI provides for the possibility of random searches on the means of transport used by the passengers and, where applicable, on the loads and other goods stowed in the means of transport in an effort to detect illegal immigrants. On the strength of the current legal Community Framework, Member States are thus not obliged to carry out either searches of this kind systematically or to use specific means of search, such as X-rays. Moreover, the Euratom provision, which concerns the protection of people against radiological risks, has to be taken into account when introducing such X-rays checks. Council Directive 96/29/Euratom Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation, OJ L 159, 29.6.1996. , the Basic Safety Standards, requires that Member States ensure that all types of practices resulting in exposure to ionizing radiation are justified in advance of their introduction. This means that an analysis is made of the societal benefit generated by the practice, and it is demonstrated that the net benefit is positive. The decision on whether a practice is justified, however, lies within the jurisdiction of national governments.
