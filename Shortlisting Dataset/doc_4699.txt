WRITTEN QUESTION E-1085/06 by Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE) to the Commission (17 March 2006) Subject: Nitrates Directive Is the Commission entirely satisfied that the provisions of the Nitrates Directive, passed so many years ago, are still up‑to‑date and relevant in the light of the latest scientific knowledge? Is the Commission aware that the severe financial burdens entailed by measures such as a reduction of whole-farm loading rate for manure and the current grassland derogation being withdrawn, the extension of areas affected by closed periods for slurry and poultry manure, and the lengthening of the closed periods from the current 2‑3 months to 3.5‑6 months with a consequent expense in increased storage capacities, will be a further deep nail in the coffin of hard‑pressed farmers, particularly hill-farmers in the region which I represent, the UK's East Midlands?
