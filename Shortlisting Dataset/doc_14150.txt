Question for written answer E-012121/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Zigmantas Balčytis (S&D) (20 December 2011) Subject: Assessing the impact of the risks posed by chemicals in the Baltic Sea There is a high concentration of dangerous chemicals in the Baltic Sea, including heavy metals, synthetic chemicals, organic pollutants, etc. Data from Helcom shows that there has been a significant reduction in emissions of certain chemicals over the last 20 to 30 years, but that the concentration of chemicals in the Baltic is still 20 times higher than it is in the North Atlantic. One of the key projects under the third pillar of the strategy for the Baltic Sea Region is to develop methods and indicators to assess the biological impact of the risks posed by anthropogenic chemicals in the Baltic Sea. What progress has been made on research into the causal link between chemical risks and biological effects on the various levels of the biological system? What recommendations are currently being drawn up with a view to monitoring toxins throughout the Baltic Sea region? How will the practice of dumping dangerous chemicals in the Baltic Sea be reduced and perhaps restricted or banned? Which countries are involved in carrying out the project? How much funding is required to carry out the project? How much funding is currently earmarked for the implementation of the project?
