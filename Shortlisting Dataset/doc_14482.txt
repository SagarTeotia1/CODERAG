Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (28 April 2009) The Commission is well aware of the case of Pastor Reyes, and has been following the developments after his disappearance very attentively (cf. reply to Written Question E‑0621/09 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp ). Unfortunately, there has not been any news on the whereabouts of Mr Reyes since September 2008. FRAME over the past year has indeed been the recipient of repeated threats, probably due to its engagement in favour of the victims of past paramilitary and guerrilla violence in the region. The EU regularly raises cases such as the one of Pastor Reyes with the Colombian Government, which it is consistently urging to step up efforts to protect the most vulnerable population groups and to investigate and punish all human rights violations. These demarches will continue as part of the human rights dialogue between the EU Troika and the Colombian Government, whose establishment has just been agreed between the two sides. The Commission shares the Honourable Members' concern about the continued threat to Colombia’s stability constituted by the continued presence and activities of both the left-wing guerrilla groups FARC and ELN, both of which have been designated by the EU as terrorist organisations, and of new groupings of a narco-criminal and/or paramilitary nature, such as the Aguilas Negras, that have emerged in recent times. It fully agrees with the Honourable Members' view that the combat against them required the concerted effort of the whole international community, not least in view of their massive involvement in the international drugs trade. The EC, on its part, supports this effort i.a. through its cooperation programme in Colombia, which — through programmes such as the Peace Laboratories — is aimed at assisting conflict resolution and at addressing the root causes of the conflict, notably drugs and the lack of (alternative) economic opportunities.
