Question for written answer E-009410/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (20 October 2011) Subject: Network against extremism The European Commission recently launched a network for the purpose of raising awareness of extremism and radicalism. The Internet and social networking sites play a significant part in this problem. Through this move the Commission is trying to support the Member States in measures designed to forestall activities linked with violent radicalisation and the recruitment of individuals to diverse extremist groups with links to terrorist activity, because according to the latest Europol reports it is individuals who are increasingly responsible for crimes of this type. In what specific ways does the Commission propose to monitor the activities of right-wing radical and extremist groups before they result in violent extremism?
