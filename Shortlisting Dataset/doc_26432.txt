WRITTEN QUESTION P-2654/07 by Stavros Arnaoutakis (PSE) to the Commission (14 May 2007) Subject: Divergence between producer and consumer prices for agricultural produce in Greece A special survey carried out on behalf of the Pan Hellenic Confederation of Unions of Agricultural Cooperatives (PASEGES), which compares the incomes of agricultural producers with the average monthly expenditure of Greek households on food, establishes that producers in Greece receive only 29 cents for each euro which consumers spend per month on the family food bill. Moreover, on some types of basic foods, the losses suffered by producers are very high. In particular, producers of cereals, flour and bread receive only 7 % of the corresponding monthly expenditure by consumers, wine producers 14 %, juice producers 17 %, sugar and honey producers 24 %, meat producers 27.4 % and fish producers 29.5 %. The figures which emerge from this and other studies show that agricultural income is constantly on the decline without consumers deriving any benefit. The objective of the common agricultural policy, which is also set out in the Treaty on the European Constitution (Article III‑227), is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture, stock farming and fishing and to ensure that supplies reach customers at reasonable prices. 1. What is the Commission's position on the gap between producer and consumer prices? In the Commission's view, what percentage of the final retail price constitutes a reasonable return for the middlemen? Is any comparative data on this percentage available for Member States of the EU? What are those percentages and what do they indicate? 2. Does the Commission intend to take initiatives and promote measures and policies to close the gap between producer and consumer prices in order to benefit producers and consumers?
