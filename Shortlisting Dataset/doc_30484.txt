2004/C 84 E/013 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1974/03 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE-DE) to the Commission (5 June 2003) Subject: Rehabilitation of earthquake victims in Attica There are serious social problems in the areas of Attica affected by the earthquakes of 1999, in particular housing and unemployment. The National Action Plan for social integration incorporates retraining schemes to promote the employment of earthquake victims who were unemployed or lost their jobs owing to the damage caused by the 1999 earthquake. Moreover, unemployed earthquake victims were entitled to places on the new jobs programme with higher benefit. What is the take-up rate for the above programmes and how effective have the measures been? Does the Commission know how many participants managed to obtain employment after training? Is it satisfied with the policy pursued by the Greek Government?
