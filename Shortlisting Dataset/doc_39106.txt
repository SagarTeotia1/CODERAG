WRITTEN QUESTION E-0235/10 by Aldo Patriciello (PPE) to the Commission (2 February 2010) Subject: Measures to combat violence against women As the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said: ‘Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human right violation, and it is perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth. As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equality, development and peace.’ The 1995 Peking Platform for Action, adopted by the United Nations, defined violence against women as any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual and psychological harm or suffering, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Violence against women is a serious breach of human rights and is an obstacle to the participation of women in social activities and in the labour market. Moreover, the statistics concerning episodes of violence are increasingly discouraging. It should also be pointed out that in its Resolution 54/134 of 17 December 1999, the General Assembly of the United Nations designated 25 November as the ‘International Day for the elimination of violence against women’ and called on governments, international organisations and NGOs to organise activities designed to raise public awareness of the problem on that day. In addition, for the ten-year anniversary of that resolution, on 24 September a motion for a resolution was submitted to the Committee on Women's Rights and adopted by Parliament at its plenary sitting of 25 November, urging Member States to improve their national laws and policies to eliminate violence against women by adopting a range of concrete measures. In the light of the above, does the Commission not consider it advisable to take action to encourage the Member States to frame national policies to combat violence against women?
