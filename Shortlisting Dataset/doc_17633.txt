Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (21 February 2006) Directive 95/46/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in its Article 8 paragraph 1, requires Member States to prohibit the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. The directive, in its Article 8 paragraph 2(a) and (e) stipulates that this prohibition is not applied where the data subject has given his or her explicit consent to the processing of those data or the processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data subject. The Hellenic Data Protection Authority is responsible for monitoring the application of the provisions adopted pursuant to the directive in Greece. The Commission will raise this issue with the Hellenic Data Protection Authority, which will be able to assess whether the abovementioned conditions are fulfilled and in particular whether the publication of Mr Alexiou’s name in the list of heresies was in breach of the Greek law on data protection adopted pursuant to the directive.
