agricultural markets (chapter 02) is very significant between B2006 and PDB 2007: a reduction of almost one-third from EUR 8 508 million to EUR 5 698 million. The Commission states in the PDB that this is mainly due to changes in the market arrangements for milk and sugar. However, this reduction is more or less exactly offset in terms of absolute amounts by the increase in direct aids (chapter 03): from EUR 34 817 million to EUR 37 661 million, which is an increase of just over 8%. This is due mainly to the continued phasing in of payments to the newest member states (EU-10). 44. Modulation is being applied at a rate of 4% (compared to 3% in 2006) to all direct aid in the EU 15 with the exception of aid granted to ultra-peripheral regions. The net modulation amount is EUR 984 million. 45. The main point to note regarding rural development (Title 05, chapter 04) is that spending across 2007 - 2013 will be financed by one single fund: the check European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). The Commission states that this is a simplification relative to earlier arrangements. Fisheries 46. In the financial perspective, the fisheries policy was a classical example of an activity which was spread out over nearly all headings. In the new MFF, the fisheries policy is almost entirely included under heading 2, the exception being a small amount (30 million) which is spent under the CAP. The structure has been rationalised into two main instruments, The European Fisheries Fund (EFF), replacing the former FIFG (Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance), and a second instrument covering all other areas of the fisheries policy, including the international fisheries agreements. 47. Overall, the fisheries policy is proposed at an amount of EUR 955 million in the PDB, representing a decrease of 10% compared to the EUR 1 062 million in B2006. This decrease is essentially due to a smaller amount foreseen for the EFF compared to 2006. The commitments proposed for the EFF are EUR 571 million (-18%), which corresponds to the advances on new programmes foreseen in this new Regulation. 48. There is an increase of 3,8 % (commitments) for International Fisheries Agreements. The amounts entered in the reserve reflect that agreements are under negotiation for renewal or that new ones are being prepared (this is normal budgetary practice for agreements not yet signed).

The rapporteur recalls that the Commission will update these figures in the traditional autumn Letter of Amendment, reflecting the state-of-play of ongoing negotiations over these agreements. Environment 50. The four key expenditure items in this area are: climate change; nature and bio-diversity; sustainable management and use of resources; environment and health. 51.
