constitutes the first initiative in moving away from a sector-specific regulatory approach in order to tackle the challenges raised by financial conglomerates, for example, by requiring the establishment of proper lines of communication between supervisory authorities responsible for different financial industries. · Directive 2005/1/EC on a new organisational structure for financial services committee (the so-called 'Lamfalussy committees '). Amongst other things, this law sets up CEIOPS, the European Committee of Insurance and Pensions Supervisors. The 'Lamfalussy process' consists of four levels: - Level 1: The EP and Council adopt legislation in co-decision, determining framework principles and guidelines on implementing powers - Level 2: Technical implementing measures taking the form of further directives and/or regulations, adopted under powers delegated at level one - Level 3: Networking between regulators with a view to producing joint interpretative recommendations, consistent guidelines and common standards, peer review, and comparisons between regulatory practice to ensure consistent implementation and application - Level 4: Monitoring by the European Commission of Member State compliance with EU legislation and enforcement action where necessary. · Directive 2005/68/EC on reinsurance activities. As reinsurance activities conducted by specialised reinsurance undertakings were not subject to EU law at the time, a specialized directive was adopted, to establish a legal framework for this activity and address the weaknesses in existing provisions, which had resulted in significant differences in the level of supervision of reinsurance undertakings in the EU, in turn creating barriers to the pursuit of reinsurance business. · The future Solvency II Directive, a second reform of the solvency margins of insurance companies. This project has been in the pipeline for several years and is expected to be presented by the Commission in July 2007. The main elements of the proposal are to harmonise capital adequacy standards and develop more risk-based rules, in an effort to match solvency requirements more closely to the true risk encountered by an insurance undertaking, as well as enhancing the powers of intervention of insurance regulators.
