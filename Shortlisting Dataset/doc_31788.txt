WRITTEN QUESTION E-1861/06 by Mary McDonald (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (3 May 2006) Subject: EU policy on gender equality Does the Commission accept that in order to realise its commitment to gender equality, the EU must develop a coherent policy response that includes macroeconomic policy, employment policy, social protection and issues of childcare? With regard to this, what steps has the Commission taken to develop EU macroeconomic policies to ensure that these support greater gender equality and the further development of the European social model, including public services and civil society participation? What further initiatives are planned?
