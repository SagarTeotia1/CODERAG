18 March 2003 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION pursuant to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure by Ilda Figueiredo and Jonas Sjöstedt on the impact of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on organic/conventional farming Motion for a European Parliament resolution on the impact of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on organic/conventional farming The European Parliament, A. whereas the precautionary principle must prevail and whereas scientific research offers no guarantees regarding the introduction of GMOs into the food chain and the implications thereof for the environment and the health of either humans or animals, B. whereas releasing GMOs into the environment constitutes an irreversible and uncontrollable act whose effects on eco-systems and biodiversity are incalculable, C. whereas the introduction of GMO crops makes it highly likely that organic/conventional crops will be polluted and that organic/conventional farmers will consequently be deprived of any freedom of choice, D. whereas, in view of the risks which GMOs represent, there are no grounds for lifting the de facto moratorium on GMO authorisation, especially since no labelling and tracing system has been introduced and no assessment has been carried out of the impact which GMOs may have on organic/conventional farming, E. whereas 70% of the EU population is against GMOs and countless farmers', environmentalists' and consumers' associations are calling for the current moratorium to remain in force, 1. Urges the Council and the Commission to continue the moratorium and to launch a broad public debate on the impact of GMOs on organic/conventional farming; 2. Calls upon the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection to draw up own-initiative reports on the impact of GMOs on organic/conventional farming.
