Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (11 May 2010) The Commission takes note of the doubts raised by the Honourable Member on the compatibility of the Italian Government’s Legislative Decree No 169 on an advertising ceiling for pay TV with Directive 89/552/EC Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, OJ L 298, 17.10.1989. , as amended by Audiovisual Media Service Directive 2007/65/EC (hereinafter: AVMS Directive). Despite the 19 December 2009 deadline for transposing the AVMS Directive, the Commission has, at this stage, neither been notified of this Decree, nor been informally consulted by the Italian Government on its content. The Commission therefore launched infringement proceedings against Italy on 28 January 2010 for non-communication of implementing measures. Given that the national legislation process has not been completed yet and that the Italian authorities still have to notify their finalised legislation to the Commission — possibly with other pieces of legislation — it is too early for the Commission to give its assessment. For these reasons, the Commission cannot reply in substance to the questions raised by the Honourable Member. However, the Commission would like to stress that the objective of the AVMS Directive is to lay down the minimum rules needed to guarantee the freedom of movement of audiovisual media services within the European Union, for example in relation to advertising, and, as noted in Recital 19 of the consolidated version of the directive Amended former Recital 13 of Directive 89/552/EC. , it does not affect the responsibility of the Member States with regard to the organisation and financing of these services.
