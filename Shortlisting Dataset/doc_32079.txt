Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (9 January 2006) Under Regulation No 1408/71 Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of the Council of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community, OJ L 149, 5.7.1971. (Article 13(2)(a)), the social security scheme applicable to employed persons who for reasons of work, move from one Member State to another is, generally speaking, that established by the legislation of the Member State of new employment. In order to avoid unnecessary and costly administrative complications for workers, companies and administrations, the Community provisions provide for certain exceptions to the general principle mentioned above. The main exception is laid down in Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 which stipulates that a person who is normally employed by an undertaking in a Member State (posting State) and is sent by this undertaking to another Member State (State of employment) to perform work for that undertaking, continues to be subject to the social security scheme of the Member State in which the undertaking normally operates (the posting State) provided that the duration of that work does not exceed 12 months (which may be extended by another 12 months). In December 2000, the Administrative Commission adopted an interpretative Decision concerning the interpretation of the posting provisions contained in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 Decision No 181 of 13 December 2000 concerning the interpretation of Articles 14 (1), 14a(1) and 14b(1) and (2) of Council Regulation No 1408/71 on the legislation applicable to posted workers and self-employed workers temporarily working outside the competent State, OJ L 329, 14.12.2001. . According to point 4 of this decision, the provisions of Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 do not apply if the worker is recruited in a Member State in order to be sent by an undertaking situated in a second Member State to an undertaking in a third Member State. The reasons which prompted stringent exclusion of the applicability of posting in this case are that the complexity of the relations stemming from this situation which offers no guarantee as to the existence of a direct relationship between worker and posting undertaking, contrast with the objective of avoiding administrative complications and fragmentation of the existing insurance history which is the raison d’être of the provisions governing posting. According to Point 10 of this Decision, the Administrative Commission has adopted for the benefit of the administrative authorities, undertakings and workers a practical guide for the posting of workers in the Member States and the European Economic Area and in Switzerland. This code of good practice is available on the Europa Plus server at the following URL: http://europa.eu.int/comm/employment_social/social_security_schemes/docs_en.htm The Commission has contacted the Dutch authorities to obtain information on the conditions subject to which they issue E101 forms to temporary employment agencies based in the Netherlands. They will inform the Honourable Member of the outcome of this request.
