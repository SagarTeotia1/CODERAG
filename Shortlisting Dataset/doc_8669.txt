ORAL QUESTION H-0523/04 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Ignasi Guardans Cambó to the Commission Subject: Terrorism In the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the fight against terrorism, the Member States were required to pass legislation in a number of areas related to combating terrorism, with a view to establishing common definitions in the face of the threats in question. Article 11 of this framework decision called on the Commission and Council to make an assessment by the end of 2003 of the forms of implementation by the Member States of specific anti-terrorism measures. These texts were finally submitted by the Commission (8 June 2004 - COM(2004)0409 /final) and the Council (12 October 2004 - 11687/2/04-rev-2). Both reports stress, in clear and objective fashion, the passivity of the Member States and their failure to comply with the objectives set out in the Council framework decision. The Commission does not possess binding legal instruments to oblige the Member States to comply with framework decisions. Despite this and with a view to ensuring the EU's credibility in the fight against terrorism, can the Commission state how it intends to promote and obtain a genuine anti-terrorist policy at Union level and ensure that the Member States act on their promises regarding legislative action?
