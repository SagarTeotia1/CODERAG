the absence of patent access facilities for very small businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), could stifle further innovation, Ac. whereas the likely convergence of nanotechnology with biotechnology, biology, cognitive sciences and information technology raises serious questions relating to ethics, safety, security and respect for fundamental rights that need to be analysed by a new opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, Ad. whereas the Code of Conduct is an essential instrument for safe, integrated and responsible research in nanomaterials; whereas the Code of Conduct must be adopted and respected by all producers intending to manufacture or place goods on the market, Ae. whereas the precautionary principle, the polluter-pays principle and sustainability objectives should form the basis of the regulatory and guidance framework for nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, and these principles and objectives should help steer the development of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials towards uses that are of greatest benefit to society, 1. Is convinced that the use of nanomaterials should respond to the real needs of citizens and that their benefits can only be realised in a safe and responsible manner within a clear regulatory and policy framework (legislative and other provisions) that explicitly addresses existing and expected applications of nanomaterials as well as the very nature of potential health, environmental and safety problems over their life cycle; 2. Deplores the absence of a proper evaluation of the de facto application of the general provisions of Community law in the light of the actual nature of nanomaterials; 3. Does not agree, in the absence of any nano-specific provisions in Community law, with the Commission's conclusion that current legislation covers in principle the relevant risks relating to nanomaterials, when due to the lack of appropriate data and methods to assess the risks relating to nanomaterials it is effectively unable to address their risks; 4. Considers that as long as current legislation does not contain any nano-specific provisions, and as long as data and methods to adequately assess the risks of nanomaterials are missing, better implementation of current law alone cannot bring about the necessary level of protection; 5. Considers that the concept of the "safe, responsible and integrated approach" to nanotechnologies advocated by the European Union, is jeopardised by the lack of information on the use and on the safety of nanomaterials that are already on the market, particularly in sensitive applications with direct exposure of consumers; 6. Draws attention to the fact that different categories of people might be at risk at different stages of the product lifecycle: in the production and handling stages, in packaging, transport and maintenance, during disposal and demolition, and where secondary and end-users, and consumers are concerned; recalls that risk assessment has to be based on normal use and accidents, as well as the fact that the features are inhalation, dermal and other routes of exposure; stresses that the relevant legislation has to take into account the categories of people at risk as well as the risks related to these categories; 7. ¨Calls on the Commission to review all relevant legislation within
