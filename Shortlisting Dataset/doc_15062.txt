Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2005) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for drawing its attention to the state of play concerning the physical demarcation of the international border between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro on its Kosovo part. The Commission is aware that the physical demarcation of the Northern border of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been started by the national authorities and would like to inform the Honourable Member that these operations have been supported by the 2001 CARDS programme. As regards the Kosovo section of the border, the 2001 CARDS programme had foreseen funding for demarcation subject to the meeting of certain conditions. In consultation with the Government, the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the Commission has decided not to support that part of the operation at this stage and to consider such a possibility, in the context of the CARDS Integrated Border Management programme, when the political conditions are met. The Commission is encouraging all parties concerned to make all possible efforts to find a negotiated solution which contributes to the long term stability of the whole region and facilitates its approximation to the European Union.
