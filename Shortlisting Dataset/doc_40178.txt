Question for written answer E-6604/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE) (19 August 2010) Subject: Management of funds for the reconstruction of Afghanistan The recent international conference on Afghanistan (20.7.2010) agreed, inter alia, to transfer a greater share of international development aid to be managed by the state budget of Afghanistan: 50% over the next two years compared to the 20% at present. However, development and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan’s budget continue to be the subject of strong criticism both within and outside the country owing to widespread corruption. In view of the above, will the Commission say: What is its position as regards the ability of the relevant Afghan services to manage international development aid? Where does it believe the management problems lie? Which development projects are funded from EU funds, how close to completion are they and what is their impact on development? What is being done to ensure the proper use of European funding?
