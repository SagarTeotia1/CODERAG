Question for written answer E-011574/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jean-Luc Bennahmias (ALDE) (8 December 2011) Subject: Practical achievements arising from the EU Forum for University-Business Dialogue Following its communication of 2 April 2009 entitled ‘A new partnership for the modernisation of universities: the EU Forum for University Business Dialogue’, the Commission undertook to draw up a future work programme for the forum and a series of specific initiatives to respond to the most urgent issues at hand, in particular regarding employability. The purpose of the Forum for University-Business Dialogue was to establish closer links between businesses and universities, not least in order to address effectively the issues of unemployment and the lack of entrepreneurial skills among young people, as well as the gap between the skills needed on the labour market and those acquired during education. What type of initiatives is the Commission currently considering with a view to making good on the progress made at the University-Business Forum, particularly with regard to combating youth unemployment in Europe? How does the Commission specifically intend to actively encourage the national authorities to set up bodies to encourage university-business cooperation at national level? What instruments does the Commission intend to put in place to encourage businesses to invest in universities?
