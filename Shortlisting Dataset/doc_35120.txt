Incidentally, this is one of the main reasons why the competent authorities proposed the modification approved by Decision C(2006)6739. Regarding the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑3141/07 , and because the competent authorities considered that they would not be able to comply with the conditions set in Decision C(2003)5311, they have set up a Technical Group, in 2005, which provided to the Spanish Ministry of Environment the results of more or less 500 simulations examined over the possibilities to transfer excess water from the River Júcar to the River Vinalopó and the consequences to areas dependent on the ceding basin, including the wetland of La Albufera. These simulations made it obvious that the change of the water intake from the point called Cortes de Pallás to the River Estuary (Azud de la Marquesa) was the most viable solution. Regarding the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑3142/07 , the Commission cannot provide any further information, as for the moment it has not received any new certification of costs for the operational programme for the Valencia Community (2000‑06).
