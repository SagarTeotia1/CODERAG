ORAL QUESTION H-0873/08 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Hans-Peter Martin to the Council Subject: Democratisation of the ESDP by the Lisbon Treaty The democratic legitimacy of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is based on four pillars: first, the agreement of Europe’s citizens; second, the assent and oversight of the national parliaments; third, the assent and oversight of the European Parliament. Unlike other policy fields, legitimation of the ESDP is also based – fourthly – on the connection to international law. Wolfgang Wagner, in his study for the Hessische Stiftung Friedens- und Konflitkforschung (Hessen Peace and Conflict Research Institute) on the democratic legitimacy of the ESDP, comes to the conclusion that ‘none of the four pillars of democratic legitimisation is particularly robust or, in the event of a difficult military operation, sufficiently resilient’. What concrete measures were agreed in the Lisbon Treaty, in the view of the Council, and in which of its articles, to enable the legitimacy of these four pillars of the ESDP to be strengthened?
