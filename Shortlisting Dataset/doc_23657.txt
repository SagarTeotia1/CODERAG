Regulation as last amended by Commission Decision 2004/232/EC (OJ L 71, 10.3.2004, p. 28). , HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Scope This Regulation shall apply to the containment, the use and the recovery of fluorinated greenhouse gases, including hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride as listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, to the placing on the market and use of products and equipment containing those gases and to the reporting of data on those gases. An indicative list of the gases covered by this Regulation is given in Annex I. This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to Directives 75/442/EEC, 96/61/EC, 2000/53/EC and 2002/96/EC. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply: a) "producer" means any natural or legal person manufacturing fluorinated greenhouse gases within the Community; ( b ) "placing on the market" means the supplying or making available to third parties, against payment or free of charge, of fluorinated greenhouse gases governed by this Regulation, or of products and equipment containing such gases or requiring them for their operation. With regard to vehicles, "placing on the market" relates to new vehicle types; ( c ) "receptacle" means transportable pressure equipment, as defined in Article 2(1) of Council Directive 1999/36/EC of 29 April 1999 OJ L 138, 1.6.1999, p. 20. , for the supply of fluorinated greenhouse gases. This definition does not cover containers used in laboratories for analytical purposes and metered dose inhalers; ( d ) "recovery" means the collection and storage of fluorinated greenhouse gases from, for example, machinery, equipment and containment vessels during their servicing or disposal ; ( e ) "recycling" means the reuse of a recovered fluorinated greenhouse gas following a basic cleaning process such as filtering and drying. For refrigerants, recycling normally involves recharge back into equipment as is often carried out on site; ( f ) "reclamation" means the reprocessing and upgrading of a recovered fluorinated greenhouse gas through such processes as filtering, drying, distillation and chemical treatment in order to restore the substance to a specified standard of performance, which often involves processing off site at a central facility; g) "destruction " means the irreversible transformation of the chemical nature of a substance; ( h ) "vehicles" means any motor vehicle of categories M1 and class I of N1, as defined in Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (OJ L 42, 23.2.1970, p. 1).
