10%. Up to 70% of the anti-malaria drugs available in Cameroon are counterfeit. In 2003 the WHO corroborated this figure for six other African countries. Of the medicinal products consumed in poor countries, 25% are allegedly counterfeit. The EU is a late entrant to the international fight against counterfeiting. - What action (in addition to publishing the Commission Communication entitled 'Strategy for the enforcement of intellectual-property rights in third countries') has the EU taken and is it intending to take in order to combat the scourge of counterfeit medicines on its territory? There are many reasons accounting for such a huge presence of counterfeit medicinal products in developing countries. - What action does the EU intend to take in order to help poor countries to regulate and monitor the quality of medical products and equipment placed on the market? - Should the EU not play an active role in the promotion of an International Convention designed to ensure that each country makes the counterfeiting of medicinal products (or the handling thereof) a specific crime or offence under its law?

There are over 40 million immigrants in the European Union today and they might be seen as the 26th Member State, says the report. Integration of immigrants is not just a local matter but one of EU-wide importance, since successful integration will strengthen the Union’s economy. The EU should therefore make an effort to integrate this population equivalent to that it has made to integrate accession countries. The committee essentially welcomes a Commission proposal to establish a European fund for the integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007-2013, while making some suggestions as to the fund's strategy. It also calls for monitoring mechanisms to evaluate integration programmes in the Member States. It encourages the Commission to consult migrant communities in defining and implementing European aid and development policies in their home countries. The report urges Member States " to establish transparent, humane, fast and reasonable procedures for the granting of long-term resident status, for family reunification and for the naturalisation of long-term resident immigrants and their children ". At the same time, the committee expresses approval for the integration programmes of certain Member States involving a mutual commitment by the host country and immigrants.
