Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (27 April 2009) According to the information provided by the Honourable Member, in the UK, concessionary tickets for access to monuments are offered to all EU citizens aged over 60, whereas concessionary tickets for Greek monuments are only available to EU citizens aged over 65. The European Court of Justice has held that national legislation concerning admission to museums which entails discrimination of nationals of other Member States is prohibited by Articles 12 and 49 of the EC Treaty Case C-45/93 Commission v Spain [1994] ECR I-911. . Nevertheless, in the present case, the reduction of admission prices is apparently granted to all nationals of any EU Member State who fulfil the same objective age requirement, i.e. are aged over 65. Therefore, based on the currently available information, the Commission considers that there are no elements indicating a violation of Articles 12 and 49 of the EC Treaty, as there seems to be no discrimination between Greek citizens and citizens of other Member States.
