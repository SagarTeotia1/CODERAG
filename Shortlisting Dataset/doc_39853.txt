million; notes furthermore that an amount of EUR 16,2 million has been carried forward by the Centre; recalls in this context of the principle of annuality as laid down in the Financial Regulation applicable to all bodies of the European Community; 3.

Notes the efforts made to implement the authorised establishment plan of 130 posts in 2008; welcomes the recruitment of 54 additional staff (temporary agents, contract agents and seconded national experts), ending up with 101 occupied posts by the end of 2008, which will help to ensure the operability of the Centre and enable it to achieve the tasks assigned to it; regrets the fact that 16 recruitment procedures needed to be re-advertised; supports the Centre’s measures to improve the situation; welcomes the ECDC's revision of its internal organisation; 5.
