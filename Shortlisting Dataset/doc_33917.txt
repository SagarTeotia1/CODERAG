WRITTEN QUESTION E-6635/09 by Diogo Feio (PPE) to the Commission (13 January 2010) Subject: Outermost regions: study and crisis response The recent events in the Azores — torrential rain and high winds which drove about a hundred people from their homes and caused landslides and serious damage to property — have demonstrated once again that the outermost regions are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. In its resolution of 20 May 2008 on ‘the strategy for the outermost regions: achievements and future prospects’ Parliament took the view (in paragraph 23) that ‘the ORs provide the Union with an opportunity in its current reflection on climate distortion with regard to trend observation, damage prevention, disaster response and the protection of ecosystems’ and in that connection called on the Council ‘to adopt without delay the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund, which is specifically aimed at the special position of outermost regions’; it also considered that ‘the Commission’s proposals to strengthen the Union’s disaster response capacity should make full use of expertise relating to the geographical location of these regions’. 1. Does the Commission believe that the EU has properly capitalised on the opportunity afforded by the ORs as regards the climate change debate, trend spotting, damage prevention, disaster response, and the conservation of ecosystems? 2. Does it consider that the specific nature of the outermost regions, resulting from their location, has received the necessary attention in the Council, especially where the Solidarity Fund is concerned? 3. Is it willing to strengthen Europe’s disaster response capacity by expressly taking into account both expertise related to the geographical location of the ORs and the fact that they are highly prone to disasters and particularly vulnerable when they strike?
