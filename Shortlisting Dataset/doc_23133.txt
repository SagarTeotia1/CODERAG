2004/C 78 E/090 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2206/03 by Gerhard Schmid (PSE) to the Commission (2 July 2003) Subject: Action to confine marketing of specified products to the Czech Republic Appendix A to Annex V to the Accession Act lists establishments in the Czech Republic that are permitted to delay until 31 December 2006 their compliance, in the area of veterinary legislation, with the structural requirements of the directives applicable respectively to fresh meat, fresh poultry meat, meat products, egg products and milk. Products originating from those establishments may, during that period, only be placed on the domestic market or used for further processing in domestic establishments. I therefore ask the Commission what action can be taken, short of border checks on products, to ensure that the above products originating from the Czech establishments concerned have in fact been placed or processed only on the domestic market?
