WRITTEN QUESTION E-0239/10 by Nessa Childers (S&D) to the Commission (2 February 2010) Subject: 600 million euro fund for cycling In an answer to a recent Parliamentary Question (E‑5281/09), I was informed that ‘For the period 2007‑13, the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds provide an estimated budget of over EUR 600 million, which will be used for the implementation of investment in cycle infrastructure in eligible regions across the EU.’ Is it possible for the Commission to inform me what this 600 million euro will be spent on exactly? Have the funds been specifically earmarked yet? Would cycling projects in Dublin, or any other parts of Ireland be eligible to qualify for funding under this proposal? Is there any specific department or agency in Ireland which is charged with allocating these funds?
