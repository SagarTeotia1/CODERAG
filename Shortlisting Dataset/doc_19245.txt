Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (28 November 2011) The Commission is fully informed of the current progress of the Wendelstein 7-X project. This project is implemented by the Institut für Plasmaphysik (IPP) in Greifswald and the Commission is regularly informed within the framework of the Contract of Association Euratom-IPP. The project is now progressing satisfactorily and there has been no slippage in its time table or budget overrun for some three years, with construction due to end in mid‑2014. Wendelstein 7-X, like all existing fusion devices today, is an experimental facility and will not produce any electricity for the grid. Currently, the main line of research in magnetic confinement fusion is focused on the so-called ‘tokamak’ configuration, e.g. ITER http://www.iter.org/ , whilst Wendelstein 7-X exploits an alternative configuration called ‘stellarator’. The development of this alternative configuration, which has the potential to show characteristics favourable for actual fusion power plants, also forms an integral part of the Euratom fusion research programme, and the Wendelstein 7-X will be operated by IPP in collaboration with other European research institutes and as part of the future Euratom research effort. However, whether they involve ‘tokamak’ or ‘stellarator’ configurations, fusion power plants that produce electricity for the grid, starting with a demonstration facility and followed by commercial plants, will not be constructed until after ITER.
