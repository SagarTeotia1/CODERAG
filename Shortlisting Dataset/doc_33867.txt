ORAL QUESTION H-0119/09 for Question Time at the part-session in March I 2009 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Commission Subject: Environmental disaster affecting wetlands in Greece The competent authorities and environmental organisations condemn the fact that wetlands in Greece have long been subjected to criminal treatment. They claim that, unless measures are taken to protect them, the wetlands are at risk of being irreparably destroyed by industrial activities, illegal waste, intensive tourist development and large-scale installations, lack of essential infrastructure and absence of integrated management. The 10 most important Greek wetlands, such as the deltas of the rivers Evros, Axios, Nestos, Aliakmonas, lakes Vistonida, Volvi and Kerkini, gulfs and lagoons designated of international importance present a lamentable picture of dereliction. Lake Koronia, for example, is considered to be ecologically dead and the situation is far worse for those not covered by the Montreux and Ramsar conventions. What measures have been taken to put an end to this outrage against the environment and biodiversity, to protect Greek wetlands effectively, and to repair the serious ecological damage inflicted and prevent its recurrence?
