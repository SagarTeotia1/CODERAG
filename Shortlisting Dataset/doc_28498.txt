Question for written answer E-002648/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Emilie Turunen (Verts/ALE) (22 March 2011) Subject: Swim vests and lifejackets A group of schoolchildren in Denmark was recently involved in an accident in which a boat capsized. This incident gave rise to a debate on how the scale of the accident could have been reduced. It transpires that there are differing requirements regarding lifejackets and swim vests when used on smaller recreational craft. This field is regulated by Council Directive 2003/44/EC and Directive 89/686/EEC on protective equipment. The directives state that lifejackets should comply with CE standards (DS/EN ISO 12402 parts 2-4) and thus be in highly visible red-yellow colours, whereas swim vests under the applicable EU standard (DS/EN 12402 Part 5) can be any colour whatsoever. Can the Commission confirm that it is not currently possible for an individual Member State to have stricter standards on lifejackets and swim vests than the EU rules? Does the Commission plan to review Directive 89/686/EEC on protective equipment? Will the Commission also work to ensure it is possible for individual Member States to apply the provisions of the directives more strictly than is currently the case, so that they can stipulate that swim vests must be in the same conspicuous colours as lifejackets?
