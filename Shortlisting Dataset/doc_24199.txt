Reply (4 March 2004) The Honourable Parliamentarian of the European Parliament is informed that the Council can not take a position in respect of an ongoing criminal procedure. As the Honourable Parliamentarian are certainly aware, the EU is pressing for reform of the judiciary in Romania in view of EU accession. The EU has continuously stressed that the establishment of an independent, reliable and efficient judiciary is of paramount importance for Romania and has strongly invited Romania to strengthen the independence of the judiciary vis-à-vis the executive.
