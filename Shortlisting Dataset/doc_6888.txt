Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (12 July 2005) 1. As regards the protection of the health and safety of workers at work, the Council Framework Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 OJ L 183, 29.6.1989 . introduces measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work and, as such, it confers rights and obligations on workers and employers. According to the definition given in Article 3 a) of the directive, a worker is any person employed by an employer, including trainees and apprentices but excluding domestic servants. Thus, the framework directive does not apply to schoolchildren (unless they are apprentices) but will apply in the case of teachers who are employed at the school as workers. It should also be underlined that as far as the teachers are concerned, individual health and safety directives under the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC may be applicable, in particular: (i) In relation to the alleged exposure to chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and solvents Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 OJ L 131, 5.5.1998 . on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work which introduces minimum requirements for the protection of workers from risks to their health and safety from the effects of chemical agents that are present at the workplace or as a result of any activity involving chemical agents; and (ii) In relation to the alleged exposure to asbestos the Directive 83/477/EEC OJ L 263, 24.9.1983 . , (as last amended by Directive 2003/18/EC OJ L 97, 15.4.2003 . ) on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work may also be applicable. This directive prohibits activities which expose workers to asbestos fibres, with the exception of the treatment and disposal of products resulting from demolition and asbestos removal. The latest amendment of this Directive reduces the worker's exposure limit value for asbestos. Instead of the two limit values established by Directive 83/477/EEC, one unique limit value is fixed: 0.1 fibres per cm3, in air, as an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA). According to article 2 of Directive 2003/18/EC, Member States shall comply with the directive by 15 April 2006 at the latest. It should be noted that the health and safety directives need to be transposed by Member States into their national laws. As far as the protection of children's health and safety is concerned, it should be mentioned that there is no relevant community legislation covering this issue, With regard to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the EC is not a party to that Convention. 2. As regards the pollutant complex volatile organic compound (VOC), the health and safety directives that could be relevant are the abovementioned Directives 89/391/EEC and 98/24/EC, for which Germany has communicated to the Commission national transposing measures. In implementation of Directive 98/24/EC, the Commission has adopted Directive 2000/39/EC of 8 June 2000 establishing a first list of indicative occupational exposure limit values OJ L 142, 16.6.2000 . .
