as easy as possible. As the Commissioner rightly said, liquid explosives can be disguised as very innocuous substances, and a patchwork of 27 separate regulations would have been unacceptable. I therefore support the initiative he took in introducing these measures but, as he rightly says, these measures can be improved and need to be examined in the light of experience."

Boguslaw Liberadzki (PES, PL) says that the new proposal integrates the existing rules into one piece of EU law which will cover the land transport modes road and rail and include inland waterway transport as well. It is expected that this report at first reading in co-decision may lead to a direct agreement with Council. The House also adopted an amendment which stipulates that Member States may still lay down specific requirements for the national and international transport of dangerous goods within their territory as regards vehicles, wagons and inland waterway vessels not covered by the new directive, where specified, the use of prescribed routes, including the use of prescribed modes of transport and special rules for the transport of dangerous goods in passenger trains. A broad majority of MEPs believe that the proposals will contribute to the objective of legislative simplification and that these simpler rules would also mean safer transport. The current EU laws on the transport of dangerous goods already covers road and rail transport but these rules are complicated and difficult to implement for citizens, transport operators and national authorities. In including inland waterways as well, the new legislative format will be much easier to understand and apply than the current legislation. So far, no EU rules for inland waterways exist. Taking into consideration that the impact of this sector is growing, it is felt that an accident in inland waterways might have serious consequences and that one single set of rules would reduce this risk. The total amount of dangerous goods transport in the EU is about 110 billion tonne/kms a year, of which 58% by road, 25% by rail and 17% by inland waterway. The share of dangerous goods transport in total freight transport is 8%. The current international agreements regulating international transport of dangerous goods are based on UN Recommendations, which have been implemented in the inland transport sector in Europe by means of three instruments: - European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road (ADR); - Regulations concerning international carriage of dangerous goods by rail (RID); - European Agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by inland waterways (ADN) ADN
