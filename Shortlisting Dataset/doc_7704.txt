sites taking full advantage of their economic and social potential. Participants have proposed 186 emblematic sites to be considered under the programme of which 26 have been pre-selected as ‘Consolidated Projects’ for immediate action. The Commission has funded several of these 26 consolidated projects, paving the way for other public and private donors. Furthermore, according to a ministerial statement adopted in Ljubljana on 6 November 2009, the Commission envisages funding the next phase of the Ljubljana Process after 2010. Together with the Council of Europe and the Regional Cooperation Council the Commission will help to extend the ongoing rehabilitation process for cultural heritage monuments and sites to the region. Complementing the Ljubljana Process, specific funds (EUR 6.0 million) were allocated by the European Parliament in 2008 and 2009 for a pilot project for preserving and restoring cultural heritage in post-conflict areas. Projects will be implemented in Bosnia-and-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia. In order to ensure full coherence of the EU’s policies in the heritage sector, Commission services work closely with EU Special Representatives. The most striking example is Kosovo where the EC and EUSR launched a Technical Forum on Cultural Heritage to improve coordination of local and international stakeholders. The transfer of experience and know-how acquired during this successful Ljubljana Process will benefit a new pilot project on urban rehabilitation and management in the Council of Europe's Kyiv Initiative regional programme for the Black Sea and the south Caucasus region.
