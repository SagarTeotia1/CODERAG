by road users. The House makes a number of other recommendations: - an EU-wide zero alcohol limit should be introduced for new drivers as well as for bus drivers and professional commercial drivers involved in the transport of hazardous goods; - the Commission should conduct a study on harmonising road signs and rules in Europe to reduce unnecessary risks; at present, for example, differing priority rules at roundabouts can cause accidents; - the Commission should consider creating a common minimum standard for driving instructors with test and certification; - given the large number of accidents and deaths at road work zones, common guidelines should be devised for such areas; - Member States should make hands-free mobile telephone systems compulsory for car, bus and commercial drivers; - Member States should step up their efforts to increase the use of seat belts in all vehicles, especially buses; - the Commission should launch a European-wide information campaign advocating breaks in driving every two hours to combat tiredness in drivers; - the Commission should impose a general ban on overtaking for vehicles weighing more than 12 tonnes on one- and two-lane roads; - more attention should be devoted to promoting technologies such as seat belt reminders and advanced restraint systems; Electronic Stability Control; speed limitation systems; alcohol interlocks; predictive safety systems and the eCall system, which could reduce accident response times considerably; - legislation is needed on cross-border enforcement of penalties for driving offences (so that these are punished even if committed outside the offender's home country), daytime-running lights, the use of rear reflector strips to indicate the outlines of lorries and the use of installed and retro-fitted blind-spot mirrors; - the Commission and Member States should promote "awareness of the single European emergency call number 112". -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070112BRI01902 FULL-TEXT DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070112BRI01902 ITEM-009-EN DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070112BRI01902 ITEM-011-EN DOC XML V0//EN Women's rights/Equal opportunities Implementation of gender mainstreaming in the work of EP committees 2007-01-22 - 12:29 The implementation of gender mainstreaming in the work of EP committee is examined in a report put forward by the Women's Rights Committee.
