support employment preservation measures via training schemes; 9. Believes that the economic crisis requires the strengthening of EU measures to deal with restructuring, in particular the strengthening of information and consultation rights; 10. Believes that the next reform of the EU Structural Funds should focus their objectives more closely on the creation of sustainable, high-quality employment; 11. Stresses, moreover, the importance of education not only to increase workers’ employability but also to improve their mobility, which is important for the functioning of the internal market; emphasises, therefore, the importance of validation of formally and non-formally obtained skills; 12. Underlines the importance of guideline 23 and substantial investments in lifelong learning in order to lower the unemployment rate as well as achieve the goal of creating better jobs in Europe; stresses in this context the need for all citizens to have equal access to, and opportunity to take part in, lifelong learning programmes while special attention is paid to vulnerable groups; stresses that the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) should be used to finance such actions immediately; 13.

Notes with concern that part-time employment, in which the majority of workers are women, is proving to be particularly susceptible to the economic crisis; 18. Considers that in times of high unemployment, there is an obvious risk that regional and social cohesion will suffer, and therefore underlines the importance of guideline 17 concerning social and territorial cohesion being implemented to prevent deficiencies in this area; 19.
