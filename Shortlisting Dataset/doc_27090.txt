Question for written answer E-011545/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) and Barbara Matera (PPE) (14 December 2011) Subject: Dissolution of consortium managing the fish market in Manfredonia In Manfredonia the town council has approved the dissolution of the consortium which manages the local fish market. The council's decision is endangering 20 jobs. On 30 September 2011 it was announced that the new consortium in Manfredonia was to be closed down because of a debt of around EUR 1 000 000, including EUR 400 000 in rent due to the municipality and EUR 450 000 in debts of some well-known local traders to banks. These debts led to the liquidation of the consortium and to it being placed under receivership, despite the enormous flows of fish and technologically advanced marketing procedures. In the light of the above, can the Commission say: 1. whether it is aware of the dissolution of the consortium managing the fish market in Manfredonia; 2. whether any EU funds are available to reinstate the consortium and protect all the jobs at risk?
