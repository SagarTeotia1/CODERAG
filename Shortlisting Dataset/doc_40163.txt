Question for written answer E-010492/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Michał Tomasz Kamiński (ECR) (15 December 2010) Subject: Aleksandr Litvinenko Four years after the death of former KGB officer Aleksandr Litvinenko — a trenchant critic of the Kremlin — Pravda.ru is acerbically commentating that ‘Litvinenko has apparently left very little memories for those who supported him. Not even an article or a post written by “critics of the Kremlin regime” appeared anywhere on the date commemorating four years since Litvinenko’s death.’ According to media reports, the British police are currently investigating allegations that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) received a container of radioactive polonium less than three months before a dose of the same substance killed Litvinenko in London in 2006. This information comes from documents acquired from an unnamed source by Litvinenko’s widow and appear to show that the FSB obtained polonium from a Russian nuclear power station in 2006. If this information turns out to be legitimate, it would indicate that the FSB was behind the murder of Litvinenko. In 2007, the European Parliament adopted a resolution based on the own-initiative report on the EU’s 2006 Annual Report on Human Rights; in the resolution, MEPs expressed concern about allegations that the Russian government was behind the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. In the EP’s resolution on attacks on human rights defenders in Russia and the Anna Politkovskaya murder trial, MEPs noted that the Russian authorities remained uncooperative in the investigations into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London by poisoning with radioactive polonium. Is the Commission following this matter? How will it raise this issue (and other human rights issues) in context of the Partnership for Modernisation? What is the Commission’s long-term strategy with regard to upholding human rights in Russia?
