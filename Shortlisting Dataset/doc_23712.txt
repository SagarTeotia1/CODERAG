Question for written answer E-9317/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (11 November 2010) Subject: Biofuels and aquaculture It has recently been reported that aquaculturally-produced biofuels, bioplastics and other algo-chemicals produced on the basis of algae (both salt and fresh water) could play a vital role in reducing reliance on oil. The German paper Die Welt recently reported that Europe's largest aeronautics company, EADS, is going to launch a hybrid helicopter whose fuel will come from marine algae. The company's technical director said that ‘We need a paradigm shift in the aviation industry. We need an alternative to kerosene’. How does the Commission view these biofuels? Does it have studies proving their effectiveness in reducing CO 2 emissions? What funding already exists or is planned for research into this fuel?
