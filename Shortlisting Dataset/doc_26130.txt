Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2008) Infringement 2001/5176 arose out a complaint about damage to Clara Bog, County Offaly, Ireland, a site of Community importance (SCI) under Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . However, the procedure is now chiefly about the conformity of the implementing legislation used by Ireland to give effect to this directive. The directive, inter alia , sets out rules for the protection of SCIs and the Commission considers that the relevant Irish legislation has a number of shortcomings. As of 31 July 2008, the status of the procedure was that the Commission had decided to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice.
