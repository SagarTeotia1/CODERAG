WRITTEN QUESTION P-2661/05 by Fiona Hall (ALDE) to the Commission (12 July 2005) Subject: Effects of discriminatory healthcare on persons suffering from multiple sclerosis in the Union On 18 December 2003, the European Parliament adopted the resolution on the effects of discriminatory healthcare on persons with multiple sclerosis in the Union (P5_TA(2003)0601), in response to a petition by an MS sufferer, Louise McVay, which highlighted the unequal level of care afforded to sufferers in different Member States. The resolution recognised that the treatment of MS sufferers was not consistent across the Union and that this was not acceptable; MEPs recommended that the EU, in conjunction with the World Health Organisation, should draw up programmes to guarantee equal access to therapies across the Union. The resolution called for the Commission to table a discussion on the report at a forthcoming meeting of the Ministers of Health with a view to developing a ‘code of best practice’ in the Union. Does the Commission intend to promote a debate on MS in the Council? In addition, will the Commission be increasing funding for research into the causes of and therapies for MS? How does the Commission plan to increase the awareness of MS across Member States, thereby supporting moves for equal standards of treatment across the Union?
