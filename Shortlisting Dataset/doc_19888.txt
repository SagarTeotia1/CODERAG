WRITTEN QUESTION E-2971/07 by Mary Lou McDonald (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (14 June 2007) Subject: Employee pension rights on transfer of undertakings The EU Regulation on Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings 2003 (TUPE) should ensure that employees are entitled to the same terms and conditions of employment in the event of a new owner taking over a business. However, pension arrangements do not have to be continued by the new employer. Is the Commission aware that this regulation, which was introduced to protect workers, is being abused by employers? Is the Commission aware that Diageo (using this regulation) is currently threatening to outsource permanent employees in Kilkenny and Dundalk, thus having an adverse affect on their pensions? Does the Commission plan to propose a revision of the regulation to close this loophole?
