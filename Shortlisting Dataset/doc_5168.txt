WRITTEN QUESTION E-1811/05 by Mogens Camre (UEN) to the Commission (23 May 2005) Subject: Concentration of Turkish troops along the border with Iraq An article dated 5 May 2005 on the homepage of the Arab television station Aljazeera reports that Turkey has deployed several thousand troops close to its border with Iraq. The troop concentration is taking place in the Kurdish areas of south-eastern Turkey. So far units from two Turkish commando brigades have been identified. According to the article, these troop concentrations are part of preparations for operations against Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq. This article is available at the following website: http://www.aljazeera.com/me.asp?service_ID=8434. The EU is expected to start accession negotiations with Turkey on 3 October 2005 despite Turkey's failure to comply with the most basic human rights. Political opponents are imprisoned without trial. Discrimination against women is so widespread that there is no prospect of Turkey being able to satisfy the EU's requirements on equal treatment. The level of corruption in Turkey is so widespread that it poses a threat both to the economy and to democracy in the country. Will the Commission state whether it can confirm Aljazeera's reports that Turkey is in the process of gathering troops along the border with Iraq and, if so, what initiatives will it be recommending in connection with the accession negotiations which the EU is expected to start with Turkey in October 2005 in the event of Turkish military units crossing the border with Iraq in order to combat Kurdish separatists?
