Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (23 February 2012) Payments to the United Kingdom (UK) have not been suspended. With regard to the Interreg IV B ‘North Sea Region’ programme, payment claims from the programme currently do not include expenditure from UK partners. For the Interreg IV A ‘Two Seas’ programme, the payment deadline for processing payments incurred by UK partners has been interrupted. In both cases, Commission audits have identified that the management and control systems in the UK require substantial improvement. The UK authorities are working on action plans to address these weaknesses, and the Commission is assisting with this work. The Commission is currently assessing the outcome of the North Sea Region action plan and awaits the submission of the work being carried out on the Two Seas programme.
