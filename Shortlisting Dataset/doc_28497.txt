2004/C 783 E/206 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3982/03 by Miquel Mayol i Raynal (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (6 January 2004) Subject: Political rights of the Macedonian minority in Greece The Macedonian minority in Greece is represented within the European Free Alliance by the Rainbow Party (Ouranio Toxo). Following repeated unlawful acts and threats, this party was physically prevented from holding a conference in preparation for the European elections by Greek fascist-inspired organisations. Despite numerous appeals to the Greek authorities at both local and national level, the authorities have taken no action against these organisations. The party conference, originally scheduled for 30 November and subsequently put back to 7 December, has been postponed indefinitely because of the risks involved. Is the Commission aware of this attack on the political rights of minorities? Does the Commission know the reasons for the Greek authorities' inaction on the matter?
