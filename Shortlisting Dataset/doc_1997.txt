Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (31 January 2012) The Commission has already recognised standards as voluntary documents Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee, COM(2011)311final. resulting from cooperation of interested parties collaborating within a system founded on openness and consensus. Contrary to legislation, however, standards are not compulsory and there are no mechanisms to enforce them, nor to require application of terminology definitions set out therein. Although the Commission is committed to ensuring the effectiveness of its standardisation policy, in view of the voluntary and consensual nature of standards, it is for the stakeholders involved in the standard elaboration process to consolidate the requisite level of consensus in the industry that would ensure voluntary compliance. A requirement of an area-specific qualification might create obstacles to the free movement of professionals providing cross-border services on a temporary basis in the internal market of the European Union. Such a requirement would not be in line with the legal framework established by the Professional Qualifications Directive Directive 2005/36/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, OJ L 255, 30.9.2005. and relevant jurisprudence of the European Courts. The Commission would therefore not support requirements which would make qualifications specific to a geographical area or other national requirements limiting consumer choice as to the tourism-sector professionals whose services they would be able to hire.
