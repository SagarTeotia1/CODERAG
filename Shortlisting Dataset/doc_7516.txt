Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (30 August 2010) The specific risks mentioned by the Honourable Member are covered by both general and specific provisions, such as Framework Directive 89/391/EEC Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1. , which lays down the general principles for the prevention of and protection from occupational risks, and the two individual Directives 98/24/EC Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work, OJ L 131, 5.5.1998, p. 11. A number of Commission Directives, i.e. Directive 2000/39/EC (OJ L 142, 16.6.2000, p. 47), Directive 2006/15/EC (OJ L 38, 9.2.2006, p. 36) and Directive 2009/161/EU (OJ L 338, 19.12.2009, p. 87) establish lists of indicative exposure limit values in implementation of Directive 98/24/EC. and 2004/37/EC Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work, OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 50. , which specifically address work-related cancers and genotoxic risks. The psychosocial risks are also mentioned in certain specific Directives, for example Directive 90/270/EEC Council Directive 90/270/EEC of 29 May 1990 on the minimum safety and health requirements for work with display screen equipment, OJ L 156, 21.6.1990, p. 14. . Explicit reference to psychosocial problems is also made in recent legislative acts, such as Directive 2010/32/EU Council Directive 2010/32/EU of 10 May 2010 implementing the framework Agreement on prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector concluded by HOSPEEM and EPSU, OJ L 134, 1.6.2010, p. 66. . Two framework agreements by the European social partners cover some of the psychosocial risks linked to stress (2004) and to harassment and violence in the workplace (2007). Finally, a conference on mental health in the workplace will take place in March 2011. The prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) is currently covered by various individual directives, such as Directives 2002/44/EC Directive 2002/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (vibration), OJ L 177, 6.7.2002, p. 13. , 90/269/EEC Council Directive 90/269/EEC of 29 May 1990 on the minimum safety and health requirements for the manual handling of loads where there is a risk particularly of back injury to workers, OJ L 156, 21.6.1990, p. 9. and 90/270/EEC Council Directive 90/270/EEC of 29 May 1990 on the minimum safety and health requirements for work with display screen equipment, OJ L 156, 21.6.1990, p. 14. , and by the general provisions of Framework Directive 89/391/EEC. Data available from recent EU surveys show, however, that WRMSDs are on the increase in most Member States. The Commission has, therefore, decided to evaluate the necessity of new EU‑level initiatives in this area of
