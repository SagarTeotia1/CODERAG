Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (16 May 2006) As part of the EU Troika, the delegation of the Commission in Jakarta has also been invited by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry to Papua. The visit did not take place, for a number of reasons, mostly linked to accommodating other pressing issues like the preparation of the Aceh Monitoring Mission and the parallel Support Package. In the light of recent developments, a new date for the visit will need to be agreed with the Indonesian authorities, and the terms of reference for this visit shall be established accordingly in agreement with the Indonesian authorities. The Commission and the EU Member States fully support and respect Indonesia’s territorial integrity. Furthermore, the Commission has expressed its support for the full implementation of the Special Autonomy Law of 2001 for Papua Province. This law has on various occasions been the subject of discussions between the Commission and the Government of Indonesia. In this context, in 2002, the Commission presented a project — funded under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism — to strengthen the local administration. Most recently, the EU‑Troika at ministerial level, specifically discussed autonomy issues in Papua and other provinces with the Indonesian Foreign Minister in Vienna on 27 March 2006.
