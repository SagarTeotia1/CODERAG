Reply (8 November 2005) 1. In its proposal of 23 July 2003 for a directive on reduced rates of value-added tax (COM(2003)397 final), the European Commission did not include bicycles, bicycle components and related products in the new Annex H listing goods and services to which reduced VAT rates may be applied. 2. The Council is continuing its consideration of the Commission proposal. At its meeting on 7 June 2005 the Council discussed reduced rates without reaching agreement on the subject. 3. As long as this work has not been completed the Council is unable to comment on the question asked by the Honourable Member.
