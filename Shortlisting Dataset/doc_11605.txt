Question for written answer E-008639/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (29 September 2011) Subject: Progress regarding relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation In view of Europe’s energy needs, the future is clearly pointing eastwards, while the prospect of a Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals must also be seen in cultural, economic and energy terms. While no mention has yet been made on either side of Russian accession to the EU, there can be no doubt of the need for constant improvement in relations between the two. This is not to deny the obvious fact that the political differences between them are very wide. However, in 2008 over half of Russian imports came from the European Union, while three‑quarters of direct foreign investment in Russia came from European companies and it seems clear that stronger economic ties will in due course result in political convergence. 1. Are negotiations continuing with a view to replacing the clearly obsolete Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1997 with a new framework agreement or, following the creation of four ‘common spaces’ for cooperation purposes, will it be necessary to establish a further common space? 2. If a further common space is necessary, what are the fundamental problems arising between the two parties and is it possible to indicate those areas in which reforms have been sought in Russia with a view to reaching agreement? 3. Has a request been made to the Russian Federation for further improvement of the investment climate in that country and what view does it take of current investment conditions? 4. Does the Commission consider that there will be any further developments regarding the mutual abolition of visa restrictions? 5. What measures has it taken or projected concerning the readmission of Russian nationals illegally resident within EU borders?
