WRITTEN QUESTION E-5280/09 by Charles Tannock (ECR) to the Commission (26 October 2009) Subject: The independence of regulatory bodies One of the more interesting facts to emerge from the current financial crisis was that over 70 % of those working for the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) had previously worked for the banking industry which they were supposed to be regulating. As a result, it is alleged by some, they found it all too easy to buy into the Greenspan doctrine that regulatory agencies should not concern themselves unduly with the rises in asset prices or with the exponential increase in the size of the derivatives market, since this, far from imperilling the international financial system, represented a healthy ‘diversification of risk’. Despite the concerns of the FSA's new chairman, Lord Turner, the UK Conservative Party has recently announced that, if returned to government, it will transform the FSA into a consumer protection agency and, wisely, transfer its banking oversight functions back to the Bank of England. The FSA, for all its abject failures, has not been alone amongst UK regulatory agencies in receiving criticism for having been ‘captured’ by the industry it is supposed to be regulating. Such criticisms are increasingly made in the UK about advertising, energy and telecommunications regulators. Does the Commission believe that much tighter restrictions, or even prohibitions, should be placed on the ability of individuals to work in industries which they have previously been regulating, and, if so, does the Commission have any legal competence in this area and is it planning any such measures?
