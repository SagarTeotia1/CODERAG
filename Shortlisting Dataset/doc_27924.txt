WRITTEN QUESTION P-4619/09 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (2 October 2009) Subject: Bluefin tuna fleet capacity and subsidies The Community fleets prosecuting the bluefin tuna fishery have far too much capacity and are to be reduced. Could the Commission please provide data on the current and recent size of the fleets? In particular, for each Member State, I would request data on the number of vessels of each gear type (purse seiner, trawler, etc.) that have been licensed to catch bluefin tuna for each year from 2002 up to and including 2009. In order to understand how the fleet capacity has evolved, could the Commission please include the total tonnage of each fleet sector in each year? The bluefin fleets have been the beneficiaries of subsidies over the years. For the vessels operating in the fishery in 2008, how many of them had ever received public funds, either from the Community budget or the national budget? Please provide the data by the number of vessels in each sector that received aid, with the total monies received by each fleet sector (not per vessel), by Member State and by year of the grant of aid.
