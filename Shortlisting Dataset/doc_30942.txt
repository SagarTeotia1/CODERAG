The letter seeks information on a number of points, enquiring as to whether local producers have in fact been receiving illegal subsidies, and what checks have been carried out and what action taken by the Greek authorities. Can the Commission indicate what answers were given by the Greek authorities to the queries from the European Anti-Fraud Office? If it transpires that local producers have in fact been receiving illegal subsidies, what will the consequences be?
