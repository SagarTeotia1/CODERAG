WRITTEN QUESTION E-1928/04 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) to the Council (8 September 2004) Subject: Growing lack of understanding among the people of Iraq about the contribution made by troops from EU Member States to the rebuilding of the country and the guarantee of a pluralist democracy 1. Is the Council aware of the views expressed by the Dutch union for defence personnel/officers' association (VBM/NOV) on the problems surrounding Dutch military involvement in Iraq, saying that Moqtada al Sadr's ability to attract support has less to do with unemployment or the economic situation than with Iraqi hatred of foreign troops? 2. Is the Council aware that Iraqi public opinion sees the presence of foreign soldiers, including European troops, less and less as a contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq and a guarantee of a pluralist democracy and increasingly as a contribution to continuing US interference and confrontation, even since the hand-over of sovereignty in June, and that as a result there have now been violent incidents in areas that had been quiet so far, such as Al-Muthanna province? 3, Given that a number of EU Member States have sent troops to Iraq, how can the EU help to prevent a violent polarisation of the political forces in Iraq, which mostly seems to arouse even more sympathy and support for the movement or movements that are the victims of that polarisation? 4. Is the Council taking steps to draw a clear distinction between the military involvement of EU Member States and the American approach, and making it clear to all the forces in Iraq that European involvement is confined to facilitating free elections and will continue only as long as it enjoys the support of the Iraqi people?
