policy of the alliance as a whole so as to reach the objective of a world without nuclear weapons; whereas under NATO nuclear-sharing or bilateral arrangements, an estimated 150 to 200 tactical nuclear weapons continue to be deployed in five NATO non‑nuclear states (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey); whereas forward-deployed US nuclear weapons are no longer essential to preserving the security of the NATO Alliance, F. whereas Iran missed the end-of-year deadline for complying with calls to open its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors; whereas Iran has so far done nothing to rebuild the confidence of the international community in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, 1. Stresses the need to further reinforce all three pillars of the NPT: non‑proliferation, disarmament and cooperation on the civilian use of nuclear energy; calls upon the EU and its Member States to come forward with a strong common position at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, and to work actively for a successful outcome; 2. Recalls the EU’s commitment to make use of all instruments at its disposal to prevent, deter, halt and if possible eliminate proliferation programmes causing concern at global level, as clearly expressed in the EU Strategy against Proliferation of WMD, adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003; 3. Greatly welcomes US President Barack Obama’s speech in Prague on 5 April 2009 expressing his commitment to taking nuclear disarmament forward and his vision of a world without nuclear weapons, calls on the Council to express its explicit support for this commitment and asks the two European nuclear powers, specifically, to come forward with new measures designed to achieve it; 4. Applauds the convening of the 2010 Global Summit on Nuclear Security, recognising that the unauthorised trade in, and use of, nuclear materials is an immediate and serious threat to global security; 5. Welcomes the commitment of the Russian Federation and the United States to the further reduction and limitation of their strategic offensive arms and to concluding, as soon as possible, a new, comprehensive, legally binding agreement to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which expired in December 2009; 6. Stresses the importance of the earliest possible entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); welcomes in this context the US Administration’s intention to secure the Treaty’s ratification; asks the Council to give its full support to the negotiation of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear devices as soon as possible; 7. Draws attention to the strategic anachronism of tactical nuclear weapons and the need for Europe to contribute to their reduction and to eliminate them from European soil in the context of a broader dialogue with Russia; against this background, notes the German coalition agreement of 24 October 2009 to work towards the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Germany; encourages other Member States with US nuclear weapons on their soil to make a similar clear commitment; welcomes the letter sent on 26 February 2010 by the Foreign Ministers of Germany,
