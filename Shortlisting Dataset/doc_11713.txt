Reiterates its view that the European Union and its Member States should again play a leading role in the work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and halt climate change; 2. Notes with concern the number of outstanding problems which the Parties were not able to solve at the preparatory meetings, and which will have to be addressed at The Hague Conference itself; 3. Strongly urges all COP-6 negotiators to approach the negotiations with a high degree of ambition instead of contenting themselves with the lowest common denominator, since only a set of substantive measures will have a long-term beneficial impact on global climate change; 4. Emphasises that the industrialised countries should take the lead in the work to halt climate change, not least by adopting and implementing domestic policies and measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions; encourages the Annex I Parties to strengthen the dialogue with and assistance to the developing countries; 5. Stresses the fact that many of the countries worst affected by climate change will be among the world’s poorest; insists therefore that provision be made through Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol as well as through capacity-building and technology transfer for full assistance to be given to these least developed countries to adapt to the effects of climate change and develop sustainably their economies; 6. Considers that a legally binding global emissions ceiling should be agreed in distributing the total amount of available emission rights; in the long term the principle of equal rights per world
