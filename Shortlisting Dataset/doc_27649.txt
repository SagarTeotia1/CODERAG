WRITTEN QUESTION E-5736/08 by Maria Matsouka (PSE) to the Commission (22 October 2008) Subject: International economic crisis and pension insurance funds It has been reported that over the last fifteen months American pension funds have sustained losses amounting to USD 2 trillion as a result of the international crisis on the stock market. Not even the traditional ‘defined pension benefit’ plans, which were considered to be the most secure, have been spared, registering a 15 % fall in value over the last year. Finally, the current climate in the USA is highlighted by the USD 300 billion loss in value sustained by federal government pension schemes between the second quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008, 60 % of public sector pension reserve funds having been invested on the stock market, 30 % in domestic bonds, 5 % in property and the remaining 5 % elsewhere. Given the devastating impact which this will have on wage earners and households in the USA and its implications for the European economy, can the Commission provide the following information: (a) Does it have information concerning the impact of the international economic crisis on public and private pension schemes in the 27 EU Member States? (b) Does it intend to consult the Member States on a possible plan of averting the crisis or containing the impact thereof on the pension funds in question? (c) Is it aware of the situation confronting pension funds in Greece following a recent decision by pension fund managers to channel a large percentage of reserve capital into risky investment schemes without informing workers?
