ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0013/06 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by István Szent-Iványi , Graham Watson and Ignasi Guardans Cambó , on behalf of the ALDE Group to the Commission Subject: Freedom of movement of workers and transition periods Free movement of persons is one of the most fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Community law. It includes the right for EU nationals to move to another EU Member State to take up employment. The Accession Treaty provides for a transitional period whereby Community law on free movement of workers may be deferred for a maximum period of 7 years in the enlarged EU. According to Council Directive 2003/109/EC Member States are required to ensure equal treatment between long-term third-country residents and nationals as regards access to employment and self-employed activity as of 23 January 2006. Thus the situation from that date contravenes the provisions of the Accession Treaty stipulating that the present Member States shall, during any period when national measures or those resulting from bilateral agreements are applied, give preference to workers who are nationals of the Member States over workers who are nationals of third countries as regards access to their labour market. Does the Commission intend to submit proposals to remedy the situation as regards unequal treatment on the labour market of third-country nationals and citizens of the Member States that joined on 1 May 2004?
