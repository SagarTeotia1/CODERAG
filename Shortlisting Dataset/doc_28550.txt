Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (15 September 2006) The rejected proposal for a directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions aimed at harmonising substantive patent law within the European Community for dealing with inventions which make use of software. It was a proposal for a legislative instrument meant to clarify and codify the legal situation in that particular field. The draft EPLA, on the other hand, is a draft agreement prepared within the European Patent Organisation on an integrated judicial system for the settlement of litigation concerning European patents. Such a system aims at a unified interpretation of substantive rules of existing patent law through a unitary jurisdiction, but does not change these rules. The Commission is therefore of the view that these two instruments are not comparable.
