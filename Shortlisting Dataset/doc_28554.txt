PECH Can overfishing trigger shifts in marine ecosystems? On 20 December (9.00-11.00), an interesting PECH workshop will be dedicated to the subject of " Regime shifts in marine ecosystems ". Marine scientists from Europe and Canada will present their studies on ecosystem shifts that happened in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, and debate possible management responses to such events. One session will look specifically at causal links between overfishing and the recurrence of algal blooms. Note © European Parliament 20111216CAN34389 Workshop programme
