WRITTEN QUESTION E-1252/09 by Rosa Miguélez Ramos (PSE) to the Commission (26 February 2009) Subject: Mushroom imports from China: irregularities Recent news reports indicate that the EU has begun investigating illegal imports of pickled mushrooms from China that are not covered by the authorised quota. Apparently, according to the information available to the Community mushroom production sector, the ‘non-quota’ mushrooms, labelled as mushrooms in vinegar and therefore both duty- and quota-free, are coming into the EU via Italy, and from there being distributed to the Member States. The production sector, which uncovered this practice years ago, recently sent the Commission a detailed report of its own investigations into these illegal operations. The Commission has forwarded this report to OLAF as a basis for investigations. What other steps has the Commission taken, over and above launching the investigation? Does the Commission intend to take precautionary measures while the investigation is in progress?
