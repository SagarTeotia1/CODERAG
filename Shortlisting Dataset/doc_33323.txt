WRITTEN QUESTION E-5733/07 by Philip Claeys (ITS) to the Commission (20 November 2007) Subject: Use of EU citizens in illegal operations by the Turkish army The Turkish army is involved in various operations which both the EU and other international bodies regard as illegal under international law. As well as the occupation of Northern Cyprus, these include the recent artillery bombardments of Northern Iraq, and the possible prospect of an imminent large-scale military intervention in that country. Due to current nationality legislation, there are thousands of EU citizens in a good many EU Member States who also possess Turkish nationality. Turkish nationals are required to perform national service in the army. In connection with the riots involving young Turks in Brussels in October 2007, one of the reasons indicated was 'that many of them will soon have to do their national service in Turkey'. 1. How many people per EU Member State are there who simultaneously have both Turkish nationality and the nationality of an EU Member State? 2. How many of these people are aged under 25? 3. How many EU citizens performed their military service in Turkey in 2006? 4. Are EU citizens permitted to serve in the army of a non-member state of the EU? If so, does this not cause serious problems of loyalty and reliability? 5. Are EU citizens permitted to participate in illegal operations with the Turkish army, for example the military occupation of part of Cyprus or operations in Iraq? If not, what measures will be taken against this? 6. Is the Commission aware of any measures or prosecutions by Member States against EU citizens participating in illegal operations, such as the occupation of Northern Cyprus, as soldiers in the Turkish army? If not, will the Commission urge Member States to make good the omission?
