WRITTEN QUESTION E-3509/07 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 July 2007) Subject: Obstacles to the conclusion of loan contracts for small and medium-sized enterprises A recent study by the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry shows that small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the commercial and processing sector and firms employing a small number of staff encounter difficulties when seeking to conclude loan contracts with Greek credit institutions. According to these enterprises, banks grant loans on more favourable terms to large undertakings, who are offered contracts with lower rates of interest and lower charges, whilst also being required to produce fewer guarantees. 1. Do the procedures for obtaining loans and the obstacles with which Greek credit establishments hinder SMEs' access to loans tally with the EU strategy for supporting SMEs? 2. What is the situation in other Member States? Is there any Community instrument for evaluating the amount of assistance granted to SMEs in the Member States by government bodies, financial institutions etc.?
