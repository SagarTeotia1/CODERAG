15.2.2006 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION pursuant to Rule 113 of the Rules of Procedure by Cristiana Muscardini on biofuels Motion for a European Parliament resolution on biofuels The European Parliament , – having regard to its earlier resolutions on alternative sources of energy, – having regard to Rule 113 of its Rules of Procedure, A. having regard to the risk of dependence stemming from the predominant use of petroleum for energy production within the EU, B. whereas there is a risk of dependence as regards the gas supply as well, C. whereas very little energy is currently produced from alternative sources, D. having regard to the advantages offered by ethanol (a green fuel) as a means of solving the problems of atmospheric pollution and reducing the western world's dependence on the Middle East's oil wells, E. having regard to the successful results obtained by Brazil, which - thanks to the use of ethanol - achieved self-sufficiency in 2005 (at least from the point of view of motorists' needs), F. whereas, however, the total quantity of alternative fuel used in other parts of the world does not represent even 1% of the world's energy requirements, 1. Calls upon the Commission and the Council to consider the merits of increasing ethanol production - using (as in the USA) wood shavings and reeds, in addition to other raw materials - in order to reduce both dependence on oil and atmospheric pollution; 2. Urges the Commission and the Council to reconsider the proposal put to the Commission in 1985 by the Italian entrepreneur Raul Gardini, which pursued similar objectives.
