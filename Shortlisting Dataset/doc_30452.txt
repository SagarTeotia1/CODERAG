Question for Question Time H-0274/2010 to the Commission Part-session: June 2010 Rule 116 Zigmantas Balčytis (S&D) Subject: Regulation of the labelling and control of GMOs on EU territory A survey on GMOs conducted recently in Lithuania made the alarming finding that as many as 42% of people did not know that they had bought food products containing GMOs until after they had taken them home. This shows that GMO labelling is inadequate and that consumers are not being provided with necessary and comprehensive information on food products. How is the issue of the labelling of products made with or containing GMOs and of public information on the matter currently regulated? How does the Commission intend to tackle the problem of the labelling and control of products containing GMOs, which should be obligatory in all Member States?
