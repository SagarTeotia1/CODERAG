WRITTEN QUESTION E-3950/07 by Teresa Riera Madurell (PSE) , Inés Ayala Sender (PSE) and Rosa Miguélez Ramos (PSE) to the Commission (1 August 2007) Subject: EMSA's role in the sinking of a merchant ship in Ibiza The merchant vessel Don Pedro sank a few days ago one mile off Ibiza, after striking a rock due to human error. The hull was so badly holed that it was impossible to recover and tow the vessel, although the 18 crew were rescued from the water unharmed. The vessel itself, with 150 tonnes of fuel in its hold, sank in a mere half hour and is lying at a depth of 50 metres. Vessels from the Spanish Maritime Rescue Service (Salvamento Marítimo) put mechanical and chemical barriers in place immediately, to check the spreading of possible pollution from oil spillages. ‘Cleanseanet’, the early warning system set up by the European Maritime Safety Agency, which has been in operation since April 2007, was able right from the very moment of impact, and thanks to the daily contact system, first-rate cooperation between the European Agency and the Spanish Government's Maritime Emergency and Rescue Services (SASEMAR), a collaboration which EMSA itself has been highlighting for some time. The monitoring of the accident by satellite, and the satellite images thus obtained by the Agency, proved particularly useful in the operation implemented by SASEMAR, with a view to minimising damage along an extremely sensitive coastline whose many beaches are heavily crowded at this time of year, and which is also home to posidonia beds of great ecological value. Only 5 kilometres of coastline were affected, and the oil spill reached only three beaches, two of which have already been cleaned up, while the third will shortly be reopened to the public, thanks to the fact that right from the outset, steps were taken to protect them from the oil spill by every possible means, and particularly by absorbent barriers. Given the manifest usefulness of the ‘Cleanseanet’ programme, thanks to the regular exchange of information it provides for, and the way in which it contributed to solving the problem and minimising the consequences, What does the Commission intend to do to strengthen ‘Cleanseanet’ still further? Given the fact that the general public is increasingly concerned about environmental issues, has the Commission considered taking steps to publicise ‘Cleanseanet’ and make the public aware of the advantages offered by the programme?
