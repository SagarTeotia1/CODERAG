the development of intelligent buildings, street lighting and transmission and distribution networks and through the real-time organisation of transport; 8. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the use of financial incentives for smart grid technologies; calls, further, on the Member States to encourage the use of the most advanced remote sensing technologies, which will help to reduce energy losses by identifying leakages, blockages or other problems in major energy infrastructures; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the testing, validation, introduction and further dissemination of computer- and ICT-based methods to improve energy efficiency, particularly improved electricity networks, energy-efficient buildings, smart lighting, industrial process automation, virtualisation, dematerialisation and the replacement of physical travel with tele- and videoconferencing, in cooperation with industry, consumers, public authorities, universities and research institutions; 10. Calls on the Member States to use the potential of ICTs to enable new business models, in particular within the energy market and in connection with electronic trading in energy, but also across the economy as a whole, in order to boost green innovation and entrepreneurship; 11. Urges those Member States which have not yet introduced adequate incentives to meet the 2006 requirements laid down in Directive 2006/32/EC relating to the installation of intelligent electricity metering in businesses, public services and households to do so as quickly as possible; to that end, calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that, through proper investment, automated consumer ICTs (intelligent metering and systems providing an overview of immediate energy requirements, including those of households) achieve 100% penetration by 2019; 12. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and regional and local authorities to invest substantially in ICT-enabled decentralised energy-production systems (including the use of combined heat and power generation advantageously hybridised with renewables such as solar energy-based technologies, with the emphasis on intelligent solar-tracking technologies, and wind technologies), and calls for Community legislation and Member State laws to be amended accordingly; calls on the Commission, the Member States and regional and local authorities always to consider ICTs in tandem with decentralised energy production and distribution; 13. Calls on the Member States to create better conditions for the use of ICTs in energy-intensive industries, and in particular in the construction industry (for example through the deployment of advanced embedded monitoring and control technologies on production lines), since 10% of global CO2 emissions stem from the manufacture of construction materials; 14. Calls on the Commission and the Member States also to focus on the energy efficiency of existing houses and buildings, as 40% of total energy use is accounted for by buildings; calls, in that connection, for the creation of better conditions for the uptake of ICTs for intelligent buildings; encourages Member States to offer incentives for the restoration of older buildings and the construction of passive houses and zero-emission houses; 15. Welcomes the launch of the consultation and partnership process on ICTs; calls on the Commission and the Member States to support closer cooperation amongst all the partners in the construction, energy-efficiency and ICT sector, in particular
