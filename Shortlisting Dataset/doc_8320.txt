women and men principles at all stage of the implementation of the measures but also an analysis of which measures promoted especially the equality of men and women with regard to the integration in the labour market 9. Notes the new chapter on "Alternative sources of payment appropriations" but underlines that the financing of the EGF from unused ESF funds continues to fuel discussions about the effectiveness of the fund and overshadows the valuable specific contribution of the EGF as a flexible intervention instrument. 10. Reiterates in this respect its request to the Commission to include into their annual reports comprehensive information about the complementarity of the EGF with the measures supported by other Structural Funds in compliance with Article 6 of the EGF regulation to enhance the visibility of the added value of the EGF.
