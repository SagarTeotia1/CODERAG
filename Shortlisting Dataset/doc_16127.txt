Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (22 March 2011) The Commission has responded to the request of the European Parliament for reliable models for estimating cormorants' populations. After a consultation with stakeholders and the Member States, the Commission is establishing, under the Call for Tenders mentioned by the Honourable Member, an EU cormorant platform acting as resource centre, helpdesk, dissemination of scientific information, best practice guidance and benchmarking. The same contract allows also for funding activities to estimate cormorant's populations using the recognised approach of Wetlands International. The decision of supporting a well established, recognised, and widely accepted method to estimate cormorant populations, as it is the case of the one of Wetlands International, by no means implies denying the value of other well developed methods or models to estimate population sizes or to forecast their evolution. The Commission considers that both censuses and theoretical model estimates are complementary approaches, and that statistically sound models can be useful in situations where total counts of the population are not possible or predictions of future population size and trends are required. From a wider perspective, the present action of the Commission should be seen as a starting point aiming at providing a comprehensive database that will allow not only to develop new population models but also to further check the validity of existing ones.
