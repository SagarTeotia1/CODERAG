Basque separatist terrorist group ETA for many years. Those killers threaten any person who doesn't want to dance to their tune, especially those who are against the independence of the Basque country and their criminal methods. They don't want to hear about democracy, freedom and human rights; therefore we're their targets," says MEP Carlos José Iturgaiz . "I have been living with bodyguards for 15 years, since I was Secretary General of the EPP in the Basque Country. Any person belonging to a party who's against ETA can be a target of terrorists. I realised it when I saw that my name was written in the streets of the country in rifle sights. Then the Interior Ministry confirmed it to me," he says. "They tried to kill me several times, I know of two. Once during a demonstration against an ETA kidnapping, I was in their sights but someone stood in their way and they didn't shoot. The second time, they put a bomb in a cemetery where we used to go every year to commemorate 7 EPP colleagues killed by ETA. They put the bomb in a flowerpot, but one of my escorts had a security device that detected it. The police couldn't find the bomb, because it was hidden, and ETA made it explode later. It was a 'Dantesque' image, with all the bones flying in the air," he explains. "You can't live in a castle surrounded by crocodiles" He says, "I know that I will always be in ETA's sights. Even if now I'm an MEP, ETA doesn't forgive. And we don't forgive them either. But you can't live in a castle surrounded by crocodiles. You have to change your habits: you can't always go to the same bars, you have to be careful when choosing your place in a restaurant, you cannot leave at the same hour every day and you have to alternate your routes." He describes the impact it has had on his family life: "Your life and that of your family changes completely. For example I remember that when my son was born, the first people to congratulate my wife were the bodyguards, because they accompanied her to the hospital! In a normal family, parents go to the park with their children or pick them up from the bus stop. I couldn't. I couldn't put my sons and other children in danger." When my son was born, the first people to congratulate my wife were the bodyguards Carlos José Iturgaiz MEP 20091110STO64162 Rosario Crocetta Marietta Giannakou Carlos José Iturgaiz EN 1 DIAPOPHOTO 20091109PHT64030.jpg EN 2 DIAPOPHOTO 20091109PHT64042.jpg EN 3 DIAPOPHOTO 20091109PHT64028.jpg EN 4 DIAPOPHOTO 20091109PHT64040.jpg EN 5 LINK /members/expert/searchForm/view.do?partNumber=1&name=Crocetta&language=EN&id=96886 EN 6 LINK /members/expert/searchForm/view.do?partNumber=1&name=Giannakou&language=EN&id=1431 EN 7 LINK /members/expert/groupAndCountry/view.do?group=2952&country=ES&partNumber=1&language=EN&id=28398 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN
