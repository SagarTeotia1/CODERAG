Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (19 November 2010) At present, Croatia has provisionally closed 25 out of 35 negotiating chapters. The chapters that are yet to be closed are: Free Movement of Capitals, Competition, Agriculture, Fisheries, Transport, Regional Policy, Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, Justice, Freedom and Security, Environment, FSDP, Budget, Institutions, and Others. The main challenges are to demonstrate its ability to effectively implement reforms, notably in the area of the judiciary and fundamental rights, as well as to build the necessary administrative capacity to manage EU funds and prepare a plan to restructure its shipbuilding sector. The closure of the negotiations will depend on Croatia's ability to deliver on the above challenges. The accession date will be defined by the Member States.
