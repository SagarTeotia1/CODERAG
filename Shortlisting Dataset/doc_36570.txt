WRITTEN QUESTION E-1730/07 by José Ribeiro e Castro (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (2 April 2007) Subject: Zimbabwe — government attacks on the opposition The media report that on 11 March the Zimbabwean opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, was brutally attacked by the police, as were 49 others. This violence followed the arrest of this group of individuals as a result of their involvement in a prayer meeting. Mr Tsvangirai, chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change, the country's largest opposition party, suffered a skull fracture and had to be given two intravenous units of blood as a result of his ill-treatment. Furthermore, he refused to be assisted as long as the 31 other victims who needed attention remained untreated. Under these circumstances, Tsvangirai appeared in court, with the other detainees, so as to answer accusations concerning his arrest. Even the numerous victims who were not able to appear in minimally acceptable physical condition were, even so, brought before the judge. These attitudes derive from President Mugabe's policy of repressing the opposition, which has already drawn criticism from various world leaders. — Is the Commission aware of these facts? How does it view them? — Has it maintained regular contact with victims of this type of violence, and particularly those referred to above? — Can it confirm reports that there are increasing instances of violence and intimidation on the part of the authorities and by groups attached to the Zimbabwean government? — What measures has it taken or does it intend to take?
