Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2012) The Commission is well aware of the fact that many online creative content services are territorially limited (e.g. through geo-blocking), although technology would allow a wider, cross-border reception. These limitations result typically from copyright licensing agreements between online service providers and respective copyright holders. Union law currently does not ban the use of geolocation tools. However, the recent Premier League ruling (Cases C-403/08 and C-429/08) of the European Court of Justice states that ‘national legislation which prohibits the import, sale or use of foreign decoder cards is contrary to the freedom to provide services and cannot be justified either in light of the objective of protecting intellectual property rights or by the objective of encouraging the public to attend football stadiums’. The ruling can be read as an invitation to creative content services to rethink their distribution models by giving priority to legitimate cross-border consumer access over strict adherence to territorial limitations. It does not go as far as declaring all copyright-based territorial limitations — which are in most cases the underlying reason for geo-restricted offers — contrary to EC law. The Commission is consistently pursuing the objective of creating a true digital single market. In particular, in July 2011 the Commission published a Green Paper on ‘the online distribution of audiovisual works in the European Union: opportunities and challenges towards a digital single market’. One of the main aims was to gather ideas how to make policy framework more supportive of multi-territory distribution of audiovisual works. Moreover, in 2012 the Commission will propose a legislative instrument on collective rights management, specifically in order to pave the way for pan-European online music services.
