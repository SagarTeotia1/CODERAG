Question for oral answer O-0156/2010 to the Commission Rule 115 Csaba Sándor Tabajdi , Linda McAvan , Judith A. Merkies , Hannes Swoboda , Jo Leinen on behalf of the S&D Group Subject: Toxic red sludge disaster in Hungary Following the 'red sludge' disaster, and in view of the forthcoming legislative proposal on the coherence/simplification of the waste acquis, what changes to the European Union's waste legislation does the Commission regard as necessary? Does the Commission believe that it would be appropriate for the European Union Solidarity Fund to intervene? With what administrative and financial tools can the European Union support the disaster relief efforts related to the 'red sludge' disaster which happened on 4 October 2010 in Hungary? What will the Commission do to improve the implementation of (industrial) waste directives? How can the monitoring of their implementation be improved? What instruments can the Commission use to encourage improved reuse and recycling of industrial waste in the Member States? Do the planned revision of the Seveso II Directive and the legislative proposals on the renewal of the Civil Protection Mechanism and the Civil Protection Financial Instrument provide an opportunity to reduce the likelihood of such industrial accidents in the future?
