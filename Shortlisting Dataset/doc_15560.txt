on the Commission, therefore, to report every six months to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the execution of EARDF-related expenditure, broken down by Member State and by category; 10. Rejects the Commission proposal allowing Member States to use up to 20% of the first-pillar amount to finance rural development, since this breaches the Parliament's budgetary prerogatives and could mean the beginning of the renationalisation of the CAP; is also concerned over the implementing arrangements for such a measure, which could escape the co-financing rules established for rural development expenditure; therefore asks the Commission to communicate to Parliament between the 1st and the 2nd reading how it intends to cater for breaches of Parliament's budgetary prerogatives when laying down annual budgets, and whether this current proposal on voluntary modulation has consequences for the classification of expenditure as defined in Annex III of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1 since it implies a reduction of compulsory expenditure and constitutes an increase of non-compulsory expenditure; points out that this could have a possible impact on the calculation of the Maximum Rate of Increase (MRI), which calculates and secures the level of non-compulsory expenditure in annual budgets, on which Parliament normally has the final say; 11. Points out that, through the new setup of the financial framework for the period 2007-2013, the first and second pillars, formerly Headings 1A and 1B, ceased to exist and are now grouped under Heading 2; notes that this opens up the possibility for transfers between, on the one hand, direct aid and market related expenditure and, on the other, rural development measures; takes the view that there is now nothing to stop amounts unspent under the former first pillar being transferred to the former second pillar, and calls, accordingly, for such a transfer to be made after the end of the 2007 budget year; 12. Believes that, as a matter of coherence and consistency with health campaigns and, in particular, action against obesity, a particular effort needs to be made for the genuine promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption; calls, again from the viewpoint of consistency with health policy, for greater efforts to encourage milk and honey consumption, especially among schoolchildren; deplores therefore the Commission and Council cuts in the school milk programme as proposed in the preliminary draft budget and draft budget for 2007, and considers that heading 05 02 12 08 should be brought up to the same level as in the 2006 budget; 13. Deplores the cuts in the budget headings for promotion, given that this activity, especially for quality products, is becoming essential for retaining or regaining market share and given that promotion activities should be given a more central role in the reformed CAP, which places greater importance on market orientation; calls, therefore, for the amounts allocated to those headings to be maintained at least at their 2006 levels; 14. Calls, in view of the new rules concerning exceptional
