Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (11 May 2011) The recently adopted Commission communication on the review of the Small Business Act for Europe COM(2011)78 final, 23.2.2011, text available here: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/small-business-act/index_en.htm confirmed that reducing red tape for SMEs is a key priority. While specific information on the jobs and growth lost in SMEs in the EU due to red tape is not available, estimations show that the 25 % reduction of the administrative burden by 2012 could increase the EU GDP by 1.4 % http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/better-regulation/files/com_2007_23_en.pdf . In parallel, it is worth mentioning that since 2007 there has been a significant reduction of the start-up time from 12 days and EUR 485 to 7 days and EUR 399 in 2010. Further, the adopted amendment of the Late Payments Directive requiring public authorities to pay within 30 days is expected to tackle one of the most severe SME problems — the late payments by public authorities. Concerning statistical data on SMEs, the available data show that the number of SMEs in the EU rose from 18.7 million in 2003 to 21.4 million in 2008. The figure is expected to have decreased slightly in the crisis years of 2009 and 2010 and is expected to reach pre-crisis levels again by around 2012. The same is true for employment. SMEs employed about 82 million people in 2003 and increased that number to almost 91 million in 2008 at the outset of the crisis. Since then, the numbers are estimated to have fallen considerably and may only recover to pre-crisis levels after 2012. During the period of 2002-08, SMEs created a significantly higher number of new jobs than large enterprises.
