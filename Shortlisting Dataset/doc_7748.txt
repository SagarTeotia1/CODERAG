Agreement can be supplemented with a committee of the supreme audit institutions; 17. Calls on the Commission also to propose a corresponding amendment to the Financial Regulation of 16 June 1998; 18. Notes that the audits carried out or supervised by the Commission are not sufficiently followed-up; calls therefore on the Commission to play a more active role both in organising and supervising the audits and in following up their recommendations; 19. Reaffirms its view Recital G of the resolution of 30.11.2000 on relations between the EU and developing countries, see Part II of the Minutes of 30.11.2000. that reform of Community policy in the area of external aid should include the following elements: - a new definition of development aid policies and priorities, taking into account the aims of eradicating poverty established at international summit meetings, - improved coordination between the Commission and the Community's external policies, resulting in a clear outline of operational coordination and political coherence, - stricter application of Article 177 of the EC Treaty regarding the complementarity of development aid policies between the Member States on the one hand and the Commission on the other, - making the staff numbers and volume of financial resources available to the Commission adequate to realise development policy objectives effectively, - reorganisation of the management of aid both on the ground and in Brussels headquarters, envisaging: a simplification of procedures, the integration of the cooperation cycle, and a structure striking a balance between the Commission's external relations departments, in which one person would have political responsibility for development policy and its management would be more transparent; Budget support within the framework of structural adjustment aid 20. Notes the Court of Auditors' finding that rules on targeting the resources made available for budget aid did not help to prevent mismanagement and abuses; therefore endorses the proposal that the granting of further aid should be made conditional upon the submission and effective implementation of reform programmes to improve the quality of public financial management in the beneficiary countries; 21. Supports the seven recommendations made by the Court of Auditors See paragraphs 62 to 68 of the European Court of Auditors Special Report No 5/2001, OJ C 257, 14.9.2001. on new arrangements for the monitoring and coordination of aid with other donors; calls on the Commission to implement these recommendations in full; welcomes the steps already taken in this direction and highlights the importance of the following aspects: (a) ongoing assessment of implementation of the measures designed to reform the public administration, (b) monitoring of the progress achieved in key sectors (health and education) with the aid of meaningful indicators (e.g. increase in the number of teachers or doctors), (c) annual audit of accounting and sound management of resources on the basis of samples, (d) clearly defined sanctions (reduction or suspension of payments) in cases where the agreed reform measures are not complied with; 22. Makes its approval of the proposed new arrangements conditional upon the relevant criteria and procedures being transparent and understandable not only for the public in the European Union but
