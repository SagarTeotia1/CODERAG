ORAL QUESTION H-0481/06 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Commission Subject: Urgent need for financial assistance for fishing fleets Having been driven to the wall financially by the surge in the price of oil, which accounts for 30-45% of their operations costs, the smaller fishing fleets are now facing the immediate prospect of being wiped out completely, something which would also have a heavy impact on consumers. Will the Commission increase from € 3 000 to € 100 000 the sectoral aid which may be accorded by EU Member States to fishermen in response to major increases (exceeding 30%) in operating costs and subsidise the purchase of new and more economical engines? Will it also provide subsidies for the renovation of fishing gear and introduce new fishing methods involving lower fuel consumption?
