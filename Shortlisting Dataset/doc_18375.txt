Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (27 July 2007) The Commission shares the view of the Honourable Member that rail noise is a European concern and that noise reduction requires appropriate action. This problem is particularly acute along major freight corridors, where international traffic develops. Its cross-border nature stems from the fact that a significant fleet of wagons move across all over Europe. Several existing Community legal instrument are relevant in this context. Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise Directive 2002/49/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 on the assessment and management of environmental noise, OJ L 189, 18.7.2002. is intended to define a common approach in order to avoid, prevent or reduce the harmful effects due to exposure to environmental noise in general. As far as the railway sector is concerned, the Commission adopted in December 2005 a Decision on technical specifications for interoperability relating to the subsystem ‘rolling stock — noise’ (Noise TSI) Commission Decision 2006/66/EC of 23 December 2005 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the subsystem "rolling stock — noise" of the trans-European conventional rail system (notified under document number C(2005) 5666), OJ L 37, 8.2.2006. . This decision introduced the first noise limits for new rolling stock put into service in the European Union. The Commission is currently preparing a Communication on rail noise abatement measures with regard to the existing fleet. The intention is to adopt the communication by the end of 2007. A public consultation is ongoing until 31 July 2007 http://ec.europa.eu/transport/rail/consultation/2007_rail_noise_en.htm . This initiative aims at proposing a set of measures to support the replacing of cast-iron brake blocks by composite blocks. Various measures are being examined, including differentiated track access charges, bonus-malus systems and/or direct subsidies. Once the most suitable solutions will have been identified, the Commission will consider ways to promote their timely implementation. Directive 2001/14/EC Directive 2001/14/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification, OJ L 75, 15.3.200. (the railway infrastructure Directive) already allows differentiated track access charges to take account of the environmental impact. However, an increase in the overall revenue accruing to the infrastructure manager is not allowed (unless there are similar charges for competing modes of transport).
