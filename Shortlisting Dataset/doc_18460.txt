ORAL QUESTION H-0393/09 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2009 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Justas Vincas Paleckis to the Commission Subject: Safeguarding jobs in the industrial sector Experts state that Lithuania is now over the worst of the economic recession. In September, the Commission gave a positive evaluation of the economic recovery measures taken in Lithuania. However, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) fell in the third quarter of this year by a further 14.3% compared with the third quarter of last year. It is predicted that Lithuania’s GDP will fall by 20% this year. Thus we are not seeing the same evidence of economic stabilisation in Lithuania as in the rest of Europe. How could the Commission help EU countries shaken by the crisis, including Lithuania? What additional measures does the Commission propose to take with a view to safeguarding and creating jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sector?
