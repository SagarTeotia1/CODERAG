WRITTEN QUESTION E-2525/05 by Hélène Goudin (IND/DEM) to the Council (12 July 2005) Subject: EU sugar sector The UK Presidency has stressed that it will endeavour to reform the EU's current sugar sector. In its answer to my previous written question concerning reform of the sugar sector (P‑1740/05), the Commission indicated that a political agreement on the sugar reform should be achieved with the Member States before the WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in mid-December 2005. How will the Presidency endeavour to achieve agreement among the Member States as to how the sugar sector should be reformed? What practical reforms will the UK Presidency propose?
