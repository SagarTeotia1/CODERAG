Answer given by Mr Monti on behalf of the Commission (27 April 1999) Article 227(4) of the EC Treaty provides that the Treaty applies to Gibraltar except as specified in Article 28 of the 1972 Act of Accession - direct taxation is not among the listed exceptions. 434343/EEC of 23 July 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, division, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States therefore applies to Gibraltar in full.
