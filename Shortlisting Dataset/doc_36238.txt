WRITTEN QUESTION P-5526/08 by Mario Borghezio (UEN) to the Commission (7 October 2008) Subject: Financial crisis in Europe Were the recent massive liquidity injections by the ECB charged to the market and if so, to whom? If not, what did the ECB gain by this enormous largesse? In the current evidently deflationary circumstances (with the ECB pumping in new liquidity), what are the grounds for increasing rates, which will inevitably exacerbate loan repayment difficulties? What action is envisaged to bring the workings of the private banking and financial sector under the control of legitimate political authorities? What action is envisaged to prevent the injection of liquidity from spreading debt?
