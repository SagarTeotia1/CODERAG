themselves or from other tissue donors”. MEPs in the committee support reinforced cooperation between Member States leading to increased organ sharing between EU Member States. In particular small Member States with a limited donor pool could clearly benefit from European co-operation, says the report. The Commission should, therefore, facilitate alliances between national transplantation organisations in Member States. Transplant hotline for better information Committee members stress that “a very effective way of increasing organ availability is to provide more information to the public”. They propose establishing a transplant "hotline" with a single telephone number managed by a national transplantation organisation and manned 24 hours/day, which can rapidly provide relevant and accurate information. Reduce transplant risks Finally, MEPs in the committee recognise that it is “vitally important to improve the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation” to reduce transplant risks. Hence, the committee looks forward to the Commission’s proposal for a directive setting requirements to assure the quality and safety for organ donation across the EU. However, the forthcoming legislative framework should not create an additional administrative burden nor should it jeopardise the use of existing good practices or lead to a decrease in the number of potential and actual donors, stress MEPs in the committee.

A new regulation lays down security requirements for Galileo and the European Geostationary Satellite Navigation Service (EGNOS), to be managed by the Commission and the European Global Navigation Satellite System Supervisory Authority. Galileo infrastructure contracts will be put out to competitive tender. The deployment phase, in which all space and ground-based infrastructure is to be established, will run from 2008 to 2013. The exploitation phase will follow. The compromise text, negotiated with Council and Commission in informal meetings, took on board most of the amendments proposed by the committee on 29 January. Controlled access to security technologies The amended regulation asks the European Commission to lay down the main technical requirements for controlling access to the technologies that provide security to Galileo and EGNOS. Member States should adopt national security regulations that guarantee at least the same level of protection for EU classified information on the two programmes as is required for the industrial security of EURATOM, says the new text. If the operation of the systems should pose a risk to the security of the EU or the Member States, joint action should be taken under the Common Foreign and Security Policy. European GNSS
