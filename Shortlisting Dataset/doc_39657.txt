WRITTEN QUESTION E-0057/10 by Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 January 2010) Subject: Construction of a coke plant in Muskiz (Vizcaya, Spain) A refinery belonging to the Petronur company is operational in Muskiz (Vizcaya, Spain). The inhabitants of that municipality have to live alongside its installations, which are situated in the town centre and generate considerable inconvenience and damage. The local population suffers from well above average rates of respiratory illnesses and cancer deaths. It is now planned to extend the refinery by building a coke plant. This would result in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide, vanadium, sulphur dioxide, etc. The environmental impact assessment for this extension appeared at the same time as the integrated environmental authorisation was granted. In that assessment: — no account is taken of the effect of the extension on the SCI ‘Ría del Barbadum’ ES2130003, only a few metres away from the refinery, despite the advice of the national authorities responsible for biodiversity and in breach of Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7. on the conservation of habitats; — no account is taken of the public health consequences of the extension, despite the evidence existing on the matter and in breach of Directive 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5. on project EIAs; — no account is taken of the impact of the waste from the refinery on the coastal waters, despite their current ‘defective state’ and in breach of the framework directive on water (Directive 2000/60/EC) OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 1. ; — no evidence is given of compliance with the requirements of Directive 2001/80/EC OJ L 309, 27.11.2001, p. 1. on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants or of Directive 2008/1/EC OJ L 24, 29.1.2008, p. 8. concerning integrated pollution prevention and control. There have been repeated complaints from the public, including one to the Commission which has been under consideration for more than fourteen months (Ref. 288/08/ENVI) and another to the European Investment Bank regarding a loan granted by it for the extension amounting to one-half of its budget (EUR 400 million — Ref. 012521). Is the Commission aware of these facts? What actions has it taken to ensure compliance in this case with the abovementioned environmental directives? Does the Commission consider that the authorities have followed the correct procedures for the environmental impact assessment and the integrated environmental authorisation, in line with the Community legislation on integrated pollution prevention and control? What is the Commission's position regarding the possible breach of the Community directives concerned?
