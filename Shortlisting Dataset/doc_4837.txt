of how these shortfalls and barriers can be overcome; 11. Notes in particular the widespread lack of simple, immediate information and organisational support on energy efficiency at the point of need, which may arise suddenly (e.g. when a domestic appliance or other equipment breaks down) or be connected with particular events (e.g. moving house); believes that a lack of attention to the practical needs of citizens is undermining many energy efficiency schemes and therefore stresses the importance of practical help and up-front funding; 12. Emphasises that information and communication technologies (ICTs) should be promoted as a key element in driving forward energy saving in various sectors such as transport, construction, energy and manufacturing; in this context, welcomes the Commission's study to assess the potential contribution of various leading-edge technologies based on ICTs to improving the energy efficiency of the EU economy and reducing green house gas emissions by 2020; urges the Commission to include intelligent management systems in general, and smart grid technologies and embedded systems in particular, in the matters covered by that study; Equipment and appliances 13. Welcomes the strategy of adopting minimum energy performance standards and calls on the Commission to establish and apply them by 2008 for air conditioning and all types of television set-top boxes; urges that this be done in conjunction with a dynamic revision of labelling and notes that the CE marking can support the enforcement of minimum energy performance standards; calls on the Member States to devote more resources to market surveillance; 14. Approves the adding of domestic lighting to the list of priority product groups and stresses the importance of the Commission's keeping to the proposed timetable for the withdrawal of the most inefficient lightbulbs from the market, in line with the European Council conclusions of March 2007; 15. Notes recent progress in LED lamp technology; calls on the Commission to explore ways of advancing research into LED lamps and of increasing their use; 16. Urges the Commission to establish timetables for the withdrawal from the market of all the least energy-efficient items of equipment, appliances and other energy-using products, such as patio heaters; 17. Welcomes the emphasis on stand-by loss reduction and on the increasing availability of products and technologies which ensure that energy-using goods and appliances use energy only when it is actually needed; calls on the Commission to come forward with a 'one watt' stand-by performance requirement and an analysis of the potential energy savings to be made from both minimising and eliminating non-essential stand-by mode consumption, particularly passive stand-by; 18. Welcomes the signing of a new Energy Star Agreement with the United States establishing common energy efficiency standards for office equipment, and particularly the inclusion in the implementing regulation of a mandatory public procurement provision; urges the Commission to take forward negotiations on extending the scope of EU-US Energy Star cooperation to other products, in line with the commitment made at the EU-US summit of 30 April 2007; 19. Welcomes the proposal to establish by 2010 minimum performance standards for all other significant energy-using appliances and equipment; calls on
