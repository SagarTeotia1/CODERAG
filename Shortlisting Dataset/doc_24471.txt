D. whereas the 2002 recommendations on the Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States and the Community have to take fully into consideration the European Council conclusions of Barcelona and its responsibility for comprehensive guidance on sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion in Europe; 1. Welcomes in general the Commission recommendation for the 2002 Broad Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States and the Community, but considers that the coordinated strategy framework for the economic and social policies of the eurozone countries has to be strengthened so that the EU is capable of resisting effectively the trend towards recession, above all, in the area of an active and coherent investment policy, and, in particular, within the fields of research and innovation, lifelong learning and communication networks; 2.
