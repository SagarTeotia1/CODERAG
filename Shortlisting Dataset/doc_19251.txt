Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (18 October 2011) The primary principles that drove Member States and the Commission to work on establishing the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) were those of solidarity and a shared goal to address the risk of further contagion during a period characterised by exceptional market and economic circumstances. The EFSF and the ESM have been developed and agreed to by all euro-area Member States, as a key to addressing broader problems generated by the sovereign debt crisis. The EFSF key is based on the ECB paid-in capital key. A temporary correction of this contribution key is foreseen in the ESM Treaty for a 12-year period for the euro area countries whose GDP in the year preceding their accession to the ESM is less than 75 % of the EU average.
