Question for written answer E-000137/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Berlato (PPE) (19 January 2011) Subject: Dead birds falling to earth in various parts of the world A mysterious bird plague has in recent weeks been striking various parts of the world. After Sweden and the United States, with thousands of dead crows in Arkansas, around a hundred turtle doves have been reported as ‘raining down’ dead from the sky onto the main road in Faenza, Italy. The situation, especially in America, is continuing to deteriorate; officers of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources have reported the discovery of hundreds of dead blackbirds in the north-west of the state, near Murray. Department spokesman Mark Marraccini said that there were scientific explanations for the phenomenon. The most likely causes, according to the vets, were the weather conditions and natural events. Given the above, — Should the Commission not conduct a study on the bird death phenomenon in order to improve understanding of its causes? — Since there is currently no available data on scientific tests carried out on the birds to rule out the possibility of the spread of disease or some form of poisoning, what action will the Commission take to protect the bird species in question and, more generally, the interest of EU citizens?
