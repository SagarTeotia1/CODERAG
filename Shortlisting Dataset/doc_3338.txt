Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (3 June 2008) As the Commission operates as a College, the fact that one Commissioner is designated as first responsible for an issue, or that one Directorate-General (DG) is the lead department, does not mean that other Commissioners or other Directorates-General are not involved. In fact, the Commissioner and the Directorate-General responsible for Trade (DG TRADE) have conducted the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations in very close cooperation with the Commissioner and Directorate-General for Development (DG DEV). The development objectives of the EPAs made this a logical decision and the Commissioner and Directorate-General for Development remained responsible for related items vital to the success of the negotiations such as accompanying development support. However, EPAs belong to the pillar of the Cotonou Agreement dealing with economic and trade cooperation. As such they contain very specific and technical trade issues that require expertise and experience available in DG TRADE. This is why the Commission decided that DG TRADE would lead the EPA negotiations, with due involvement by DG DEV and of course other interested DGs.
