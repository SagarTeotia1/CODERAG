Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (16 June 2009) In addition to its right of initiative on environmental matters, the Commission also undertakes a general coordination role between Member States, with the aim of optimising policy outcomes. This coordination is particularly apparent where the implementation by the Member States of EC policies and legislation is concerned. The coordination referred to here is pursuant to the Commission's duty as guardian of the Treaties, which extends to providing reasonable assurance of the effective and diligent implementation and enforcement of EU environmental legislation in the Member States. In the areas where EC legislation does not exist but where there is a common European interest or an international commitment either in existence or being negotiated (e.g. on adaptation to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, or on efforts to curtail trade in endangered species), the Commission aims to encourage a consistent approach towards design and development of national policies, in particular by facilitating exchanges of information and best practices. The Commission also chairs a number of ad hoc coordination groups and Member States' Networks, and provides guidance and orientation on how to tackle certain environmental challenges. Further examples of coordination in the environment policy field include the Commission's work to ensure consistency of the different national strategies of the Member States to address the adverse impacts of Climate Change; and the establishment of a series of groups at senior management level on specific areas of environment policy, such as water, waste management and nature; and an Environmental Policy Review Group (at senior civil servants level). The Commission is working to establish a clearing house mechanism to exchange information between Member States on the risks and impacts of Climate Change and a Steering Group of Member States' representatives which should ensure that national adaptation strategies are compatible and consistent. Methods and facilitation of coordination between Member States alter from time to time, to accommodate emerging policy priorities.
