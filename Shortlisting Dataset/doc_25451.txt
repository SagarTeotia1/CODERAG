Question for written answer E-011916/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Iva Zanicchi (PPE) (15 December 2011) Subject: Serious political and social situation in Uganda In the last few months, President Museveni of Uganda has continued to follow the path of violence and repression. Although the inflation rate rose to around 11 % last April, sparking protests right across the country, President Museveni invested around USD 740 million in new fighter aircraft. By last August inflation had soared to 21 %, triggering a series of strikes and protests. President Museveni’s reaction was to threaten striking workers with dismissal. In view of this political and social situation, and Uganda’s continually rising unemployment rate, does the Commission intend to take any action in respect of the government of Uganda?
