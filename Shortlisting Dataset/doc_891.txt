valuing the amount of the liabilities are set out in Regulation 64, which provides as follows: “The determination of the amount of long-term liabilities (other than liabilities which have fallen due for payment before the valuation date) shall be made on actuarial principles which have due regard to the reasonable expectations of policy holders and shall make proper provision for all liabilities on prudent assumptions that shall include appropriate margins for adverse deviation of the relevant factors. The determination shall take account of all prospective liabilities as determined by the policy conditions for each existing contract, taking credit for premiums payable after the valuation date. (3) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1) above, the amount of the long-term liabilities shall be determined in compliance with each of regulations 65 to 75 below and shall take into account, inter alia, the following factors: all guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed surrender values; vested, declared or allotted bonuses to which policyholders are already either collectively or individually contractually entitled; all options available to the policyholder under the terms of the contract; expenses, including commissions; any rights under contracts of reinsurance in respect of long-term business; discretionary charges and deductions, in so far as they do not exceed the reasonable expectations of policyholders”. The principles referred to in Regulation 64 appear to be in line with those prescribed by the Directive, with an additional reference, not mentioned by the Directive, to pay due regard to the reasonable expectations of policyholders. The “actuarial principles” are set out in two Guidance Notes prepared by the Faculty and the Institute, GN1 and GN8, which are designated as “practice standard”, meaning they are in effect mandatory for Appointed Actuaries. Both the Directive and UK legislation explicitly mention that a prudent prospective actuarial valuation of an assurance’s liabilities must take into account all future liabilities as determined by the policy conditions for each existing contract, including guaranteed benefits, bonuses and contractual options for policyholders. In turn, the Directive further specifies that, where the surrender value of a contract is guaranteed, the amount of the mathematical provision for the contract at any time must be as great as the value guaranteed at that time. UK legislation does not replicate this provision but includes a specific Regulation on reserves for policyholders’ options, which provides as follows: “(1) Provision shall be made on prudent assumptions to cover any increase in liabilities caused by policyholders exercising options under their contracts. (2) Where a contract includes an option whereby the policyholder could secure a guaranteed cash payment within twelve months following the valuation date, the provision for that option shall be such as to ensure that the value placed on the contract is not less than the amount required to provide for the payments that would have to be made if the option were exercised.” Regulations 65 to 75 prescribe more specific criteria on the determination of the amount of liabilities: Regulation 65 prescribes, in line with the 3LD that, in principle, long-term liabilities must be determined separately for each contract by a prospective calculation.
