Reply (18 May 2009) The Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the European Council conclusions of 19-20 March which point out that by continuing to work in a coordinated manner within the framework of the Single Market and EMU, the EU will overcome the crisis and emerge stronger. At that meeting the European Council also adopted the EU position in advance of the London Summit including the EU views on ‘Leading the international action necessary to promote a swift return to sustainable economic growth’, ‘Strengthening our ability to manage and prevent crises at the global level’, ‘Better regulation of financial markets’ and ‘Supporting developing countries in responding to the effects of the crisis’. The Berlin meeting mentioned by the Honourable Member was convened by the German Government and brought together all the EU participants who had been invited by the G20 Presidency to attend the London Summit. Its outcome was communicated to all EU Heads of State or Government during their informal meeting of 1 March and provided useful input to the preparation of the EU position. Finally, the Honourable Member is informed that no proposal for the amendment of the current Treaties has been submitted to the Council.
