WRITTEN QUESTION P-5234/06 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (28 November 2006) Subject: Volkswagen redundancies On 21 November 2006, the German company Volkswagen presented a restructuring plan for its plant in Brussels, under which 4000 workers will lose their jobs. This restructuring is based on economic analyses and the company's recent decision to invest in a production plant in India which will employ 2500 workers. What are the Commission's views on this social tragedy? What measures does it propose to take? Could the workers receive assistance from the European Globalisation Fund?
