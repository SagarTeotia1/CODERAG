WRITTEN QUESTION E-2358/04 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE-DE) to the Commission (7 October 2004) Subject: Relocation of companies outside the EU There has been a perceptible trend recently for companies to relocate from Member States of the Union to countries outside the EU, while many companies use relocation as a means of coercing their workers into longer working hours and lower wages. Clearly, such practices increase unemployment and appreciably reduce productivity in the Member States. Recently, the Portuguese Government decided to institute legal proceedings against companies which had decided to relocate their factories outside the EU. What policy does the EU intend to pursue to restrict relocations? Is the possibility being examined of providing incentives for companies planning to relocate to countries with cheaper labour and more favourable tax conditions to remain in the EU and, if so, what are those incentives?
