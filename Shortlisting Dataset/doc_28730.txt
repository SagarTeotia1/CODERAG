Answer given by Mr Monti on behalf of the Commission (19 February 2004) As the Honourable Member mentions, on 6 January 2004, the Court of Justice dismissed the Commission's appeal in the Bayer (Adalat) case Joined Cases C-2/01 P and C-3/01 P. . While it must be noted that the issue at stake in this case was a narrow one (i.e. the concrete proof of an agreement within the meaning of Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty), the outcome has a direct impact on the assessment of the supply quota systems under Article 81 of the EC Treaty. However, the case-law of the Court of Justice does not seem to rule out the possibility that there might be grounds for challenging supply quota systems in the pharmaceutical sector pursuant to Article 82 of the EC Treaty which prohibits companies from abusing their dominant position. In this respect, the Commission informs the Honourable Member that in the course of 2003 it has filed an amicus brief in the preliminary ruling case which is currently pending before the Court of Justice and which concerns the question of whether supply quota systems, such as the one implemented by GSK in Greece, may infringe Article 82 EC Treaty Case C-53/03, Syfait, OJ C 101, 26.4.2003 . . In the Commission's view, supply quotas which are designed to impede parallel trade and affect competition may indeed infringe Article 82 unless there is a clear objective justification. However, this preliminary ruling case does not address questions related to the definition of the relevant market or the finding of dominance. These are the issues that the Commission is examining at present. A definitive finding of abuse requires indeed that the Commission establishes — in line with the required standard of proof — that the pharmaceutical companies are dominant for at least some of the products which are subject to supply quotas.
