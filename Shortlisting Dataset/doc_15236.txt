WRITTEN QUESTION E-4863/05 by Emilio Menéndez del Valle (PSE) to the Council (3 January 2006) Subject: Accusations that the EU is breaking international law Israel accuses the EU of breaking international law with regard to terrorism because, as it claims, the Union maintains contacts with Hamas and Hezbollah. In view of these bold accusations, does the Council not believe that Israel should be reminded of its own permanent breaking of international law, including numerous UN resolutions?
