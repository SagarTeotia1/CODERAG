Question for written answer P-9665/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Morten Messerschmidt (EFD) (23 November 2010) Subject: Widespread fraud with EU funds An article on the website of ‘TheParliament.com’ reports that the amount of EU funding lost each year through fraud and irregular payments has doubled to 1.3 billion euro per annum. These are sums which disappear without a trace for funding imaginary orange and lemon orchards in Spain and fictitious cattle stocks in Slovenia. Six Member States — Bulgaria, Romania, Spain, Italy, Poland and Greece — account for two thirds of the abovementioned amount, and the article indicates that, in reality, the EU ‘buys’ itself support in those countries by failing to investigate whether the funds paid out actually reach entitled beneficiaries. Does the Commission share the view that the EU pays out funds in order to be popular? If not, will the Commission introduce a more comprehensive system of analysing and evaluating the payments made, including an investigation into where the money actually ends up, and launch an inquiry into the funds which disappear without trace each year? Will the Commission also assess the impact which the EU's squandering of money has on the EU's public image, particularly in those countries which are net contributors of aid? The Commission is referred to the article entitled ‘New report reveals full scale of EU fraud and waste’ (TheParliament.com, 1 November 2010), http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/new-report-reveals-full-scale-of-eu-fraud-and-waste/
