Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (12 January 2006) The Commission's proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, which is currently undergoing its first reading in the Parliament and at Council, does not contain any specific provisions aimed at regulating the liability of services providers at Community level. As the Honourable Member has recalled, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on this subject in 1990. However, this proposal did not gain sufficient support from the Parliament and the Council and was eventually withdrawn. The Commission has no plans to bring forward a new legislative initiative in this area at this stage. The Commission is available to consider any further information with regard to the liability of services providers and its impact on the functioning of the internal market.
