Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (15 January 2008) The Commission has not received information indicating that organic farmers have used pesticides not allowed according to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs, OJ L 198, 22.7.1991. in order to protect their crops from a higher pressure of pest and disease due to poor summer weather. A derogation allowing the use of a plant protection product not listed in Annex II is not foreseen in the regulation. Inspections on the practices used by organic farmers are carried out by official inspection authorities or by inspection bodies officially recognised by Member States competent authorities. According to Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, products not grown in accordance with the rules of production set out in this regulation, cannot be labelled or marketed as organic. Finally, Council Directive 91/414/EEC Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, OJ L 230, 19.8.1991. on placing on the market of plant protection products lays down provisions regarding the evaluation and potential approval of active substances and authorisations of plant protection products to ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health, groundwater and the environment. Such provisions are independent from the agricultural production technique applied.
