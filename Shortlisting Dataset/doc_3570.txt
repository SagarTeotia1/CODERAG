States. -Adjustment of the UK correction to enlargement. The UK rebate shall remain in full except for enlargement-related expenditure. Expenditure in the new Member States, with the exception of CAP market expenditure, shall therefore be excluded from total allocated expenditure for the purpose of calculating the UK correction. This reduction of total allocated expenditure shall be progressively phased-in and shall cease to apply as from the 2013 correction to be budgeted for the first time in 2014. The European Council also concluded that during the 2007–2013 period, the total adjustment of the amount of the UK correction resulting from this reduction of allocated expenditure shall not exceed €10.5 billion, in 2004 prices (to be adjusted upwards in case of any other enlargement than for Romania and Bulgaria before 2013). This decision will enter into force in 2009.

They propose ways to change this, including promoting entrepreneurship, providing adequate research funding and pooling existing knowledge. Other demands of the report include: stronger support for European researchers, especially at the start of their careers, the creation of a single market for scientists, improved employment conditions for scientists, measures to stem the brain drain and to foster a culture which celebrates innovation, European prizes for innovation, regional zones of innovation and networking of zones in different regions and countries. MEPs also call for sweeping reform of the EU's state aid rules, shifting subsidies from big, ailing companies to small and innovative businesses. And they propose the implementation of a tax credit system to encourage the service sector to take an interest in research findings and their utilisation. The report was drafted by Pilar del CASTILLO VERA (EPP-ED, ES) and adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy by 40 votes to 2.
