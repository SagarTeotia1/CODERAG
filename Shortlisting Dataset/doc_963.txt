GAD also appears to reject my view that the papers disclosed important changes to the Society's bonus system ... I do not accept GAD's view of the papers' contents or their significance, or the basis upon which they were withheld from the regulators . The 1990 scrutiny report was sent to DTI on 20 November 1991. At a page and a half it was typical of the period, but given the concerns existing at the time, it appears totally inadequate ... The papers which Ranson passed to Pickford disclosed an approach to the 1990 bonus allotment that should have raised serious questions amongst the regulators. Having received them, Pickford appears to have made little of them ... He did not pass them to DTI . " (Ch.16-46, 47 and 52) "Roberts (DTI) commented on 4 November 1992: “ This paints a worrying picture. Over-distribution by a company with a (deliberately) short coverage of its RMM and a (continuing) policy of high equity exposure. I think we should ask GAD for a better assessment of the position and of the options available to the company in the event of a significant further downturn in the market ... How long could it continue with present bonuses in the face of a zero yield?” These comments do not seem to have been passed on to John Rathbone, who had taken over from Burt as principal actuary, until 14 January 1993 ." (Ch.16-86) "The priority rating for the Society' regulatory returns for 1992 had again been 3. The scrutiny report for 1992 was not completed until 28 March 1994 and ran to only two pages. In general the points were favourable." (Ch.16-124) "The regulators failed to respond to the existence of the guaranteed annuity rates and the Society's proposed solution, as revealed (albeit opaquely) in the returns and at the November 1993 meeting. Nowhere in the scrutiny report for 1993 was anything said about the annuity guarantee issue ... There has been no explanation of the failure of those involved to note the importance of this issue ... The regulators also missed an opportunity to make a full assessment of the Society's increased use and presentation of final bonus." (Ch.16-163 and 164) " Each year from 1987... to 2000 aggregate policy values exceeded available assets at market value (albeit by varying amounts and percentages) on a fund basis. The figures for the post-1991 period that would have demonstrated this were never in the possession of the regulators and, until the end of 1997, never requested by them." (Ch.16-173) "Whatever GAD was told about the position as at November 1996, information which would have shown the duration and full extent of the excess seems not to have been requested from the Society. Thus on two important issues (terminal bonus and the excess policy values position) there seems to have been a failure by the regulators to ask for and analyse such further figures or documents as would have enabled them to make a proper assessment of problems that were then being discussed with the company ."
