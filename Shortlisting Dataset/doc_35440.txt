WRITTEN QUESTION E-6381/07 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (18 December 2007) Subject: A universal voting procedure system in the EU Every time there are elections in Cyprus, Cypriot citizens who find themselves temporarily abroad, if they want to vote, must travel to Cyprus in order to do so. For example, in the forthcoming presidential elections, approximately 20 000 Greek Cypriot students will have to travel to Cyprus in order to be present on two consecutive Sundays in February 2008 (two stage elections), so as to exercise their voting rights. This situation causes these voters a number of problems including: 1. economic burden, 2. loss of valuable time, 3. unnecessary interference in their studies or work. It also, of course, causes overcrowding of airlines during the election period. The big political parties of Cyprus take advantage of the travel needs of students in particular, undertaking to pay in full or partly the air fare of a student voter, expecting of course a favourable vote for their party. This is obviously an unacceptable state of affairs. It would have been much more sensible if voters could vote in the embassies of Cyprus abroad and therefore there was no need to travel all the way to Cyprus in order to vote. Is the Commission aware of how many EU Member States, apart from Cyprus, use this ‘travel to vote’ procedure? Could the Commission, in order to protect the voting rights of EU citizens, advise governments to change their voting procedures so as to make them as easy as possible for the voting public and save money at the same time? Does the Commission feel that the time has come to have a universal voting procedure system in the EU?
