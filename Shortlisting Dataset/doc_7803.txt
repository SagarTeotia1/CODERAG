aimed at citizens , using all communication media, to alert public opinion to the potential dangers of the internet and the risk of criminal penalties being incurred; - the systematic provision of an effective and easy-to-use filtering system for users at the time of subscription to an access provider and developing effective filtering solutions, taking into account technological progress allowing Internet access via mobile telephones ; - serious actions to effectively combat child pornography on the Internet. According to Ms De Sarnez, there were around 260 million pages with pornographic content and information from some Member States had shown that one young person in three taking part in discussion forums was subject to sexual advances; - offering access services intended specifically for children and equipped with an automatic filtering system operated by access providers and by mobile telephone operators; - posting of warning banners on all search engines drawing attention to possible dangers and to the availability of telephone hotlines; It is also essential, say MEPs, to educate teachers and parents and to alert young people to the dangers of the Internet through the school curriculum and media education programmes. Information packs ("How to surf the internet safely", "how to filter unwanted messages") and on the use of hotlines to which reports or complaints concerning harmful or illegal sites are also suggested. Parliament is realistic enough to admit that no method of protection is totally effective on its own. It is therefore essential, say MEPs, to coordinate all protective measures, including parental control, criminal penalties as well as the involvement and accountability of economic operators. It is felt that educators could not solely rely on technology, but also that businesses could not escape their responsibilities under the pretext that parental control would suffice and that governments had a duty to introduce rules that would protect the weakest members of society. Another part of the report concerned the minimum principles for implementation at national level of measures in domestic law so as to ensure the right of reply. Parliament took the view that rules needed to be laid down to ensure that everyone had a right of reply when the media mentioned above presented inaccurate facts about him or her and which affected his or her personal rights. MEPs say that the Member States should examine and, if necessary, introduce in their domestic law or practice, a right of reply or other equivalent remedy, which allows a rapid correction of incorrect facts in audiovisual and on-line information services in accordance with the minimum principles.
