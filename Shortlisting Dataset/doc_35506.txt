Question for written answer E-000276/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (19 January 2012) Subject: Real agricultural income According to initial estimates issued by Eurostat, real agricultural income per worker in 2011 rose by 6.7 %. The authority noted that this increase is due to the increase in real income per agricultural worker (+3.9 %) together with a decrease in labour input in agriculture (‑2.7 %). Real agricultural income per worker in the period 2005-2011 increased by 18.3 %, whilst labour input fell by 15.2 %. A growth in income per worker was reported in 19 EU Member States, and a decrease in eight. Statistics show that the highest increases are expected in Romania (+43.7 %), Hungary (+41.8 %) and Ireland (30.1 %). The most significant declines in earnings were seen in Belgium (-22.5 %), Malta (-21.2 %) and Finland (-9.6 %). In terms of value of agricultural output, there was an increase of 7.5 % in 2011. The value also increased in crop (+ 8 %) and livestock (+7.8 %) production. The growth in the value of crop production is the result of increases in price (+5.4 %) and volume (+2.5 %). Cereals (+ 18.9 %) and oilseeds (+18.4 %) showed the greatest increase. In volume terms, growth was recorded in the case of sugar beet, wine, potatoes and fruit. Farmers produced olive oil and flowers to a lesser extent. The rise in the value of livestock was subject to the same factors as in the case of crops, i.e. increase in prices (+6.7 %) and volume (+1.1 %). Prices are rising particularly in milk, poultry and cattle, but on the other hand the price of eggs is decreasing. Farmers, however, recorded an increase in the cost of agricultural inputs. According to estimates this is an increase of 9.7 %, especially for the increase in the price of feed (+16.8 %), fertilisers (+14.6 %), and energy and oil (+11.8 %). How does the Commission assess this development? Does it see it as desirable, or does it wish to intervene in some way? If so, how?
