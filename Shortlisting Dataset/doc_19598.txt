WRITTEN QUESTION P-0881/05 by Hans-Peter Martin (NI) to the Council (1 March 2005) Subject: Privileges enjoyed by MEPs Is the Council aware that, in addition to the untenable flat‑rate expenses obtainable to date, MEPs continue to enjoy many other privileges, such as lavish free supplementary sickness insurance and free life assurance, extremely generous survivors’ benefits and heavily subsidised language courses? Does the Council deem these privileges to be appropriate? Does the Council consider that these issues of privilege are taken sufficiently into account in the new Statute for Members of the European Parliament?
