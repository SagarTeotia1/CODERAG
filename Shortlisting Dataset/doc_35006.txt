WRITTEN QUESTION E-5880/07 by Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM) to the Commission (29 November 2007) Subject: Pension rights in the European Union In l January 1983 the tax liability in Denmark was extended to cover enterprises and persons engaged in work related to preliminary surveys, exploration, and extraction of hydrocarbons in Denmark. The provisions are found in the Hydrocarbon Tax Act (Act No. 175 of 28.04.1982 with subsequent amendments) and the Act on Assessment and Collection etc. (Act No. 176 of 28.04.1982 with subsequent amendments) Pursuant to this act, foreign employees who work in Denmark for a foreign enterprise carrying on business in connection with the above activities, and who are not liable to tax under the general Danish tax rules, are obliged to pay a final tax of 30 per cent of their income under the Hydrocarbon Tax Act. This tax is paid through the employer who is to calculate and withhold the tax in connection with the payment of wages. However, it has been brought to my attention that employees who are liable to pay this tax do not have access to information regarding any entitlements attached to the payment of this tax. As it stands such employees are not eligible under the pension scheme in their countries of residence as they do not contribute to the tax regime of that country. 1. Could the Commission confirm whether foreign employees who are liable to tax pursuant to the Hydrocarbon Tax Act are in any way entitled to a pension or a part pension from the Danish Government? 2. Could the Commission please specify the entitlements, if any, attached to the payment of the Danish Hydrocarbon Tax?
