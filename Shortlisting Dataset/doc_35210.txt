Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (14 March 2012) 1. The structure of property taxation varies widely across EU Member States, as does the revenue from this area, as shown in the table sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. While some countries rely more on transaction taxes, in the majority of Member States the bulk of the tax taken from property comes from recurrent taxes. As the latter are often administered by the local authorities (e.g. in DE, PL, FR, IT, etc) the relevant rates differ across jurisdictions, although the ceilings might be determined in a centralised (e.g. in PL) or decentralised way (e.g. for the taxe d'habitation and taxe foncière in FR). The Honourable Member may consult the ‘Taxes in Europe’ database http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/gen_info/info_docs/tax_inventory/index_en.htm for detailed information on the design of property taxes in the EU Member States. 2. Provided they observe their Treaty obligations, Member States may design their tax systems (including property taxation) to meet their policy objectives as they see fit. It should be noted that several Member States (e.g. LV, FR, DE, HU) have increased recurrent taxes on immovable property in the past years to consolidate revenues Report on Tax Reforms in the EU Member States, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2011/pdf/ee-2011-5_en.pdf . In times of pressing budgetary needs, such reforms — in the framework of a general shift away from distortionary direct taxes — are desirable also from a growth-enhancing perspective. Indeed, the economic literature finds that property taxes (alongside consumption and environmental taxes) are less detrimental to growth than income and labour taxes.
