ORAL QUESTION H-0409/09 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2009 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Sławomir Witold Nitras to the Council Subject: Changes to the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region I should like to draw the Swedish Presidency's attention to the question of whether changes may be made to the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and the accompanying Action Plan. Would it be possible to depart from the rule that only projects that have already been agreed and commenced may be supported, given that that rule was not agreed with the Strategy's stakeholders? I ask this because the flagship project for transport infrastructure should include the Central European Transport Corridor (CETC) Route 65 from Scandinavia, via the Baltic Sea and the CETC regions of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia, to the Adriatic Sea. Given the above, what is the Presidency's position on including the CETC in the above document? What action does it intend to take in the matter?
