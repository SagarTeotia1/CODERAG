Question for written answer E-3946/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) and Niki Tzavela (EFD) (7 June 2010) Subject: European army The Treaty of Lisbon provides for the existence of a European army. The Common Security and Defence Policy is, of course, chiefly inter-governmental in character. Its development depends therefore to a very great extent on the political will of EU Member States, in particular the larger ones. Despite the significant achievements by the CSDP/ESDP over the last few years, a number of political and economic problems remain which constitute a hindrance to the realisation of its objectives. The European Union lacks an overall strategic concept for crisis management. Its operations are ad hoc and lack clearly defined, long-term geostrategic objectives. Will the Commission say whether there is any provision for the army in question to be used for defence in the event of a crisis? In the event of an attack are the southern borders of Europe covered by the Treaty from both a legal and a defence point of view?
