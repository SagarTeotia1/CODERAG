WRITTEN QUESTION P-3854/07 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (20 July 2007) Subject: Judgment by the Turkish Supreme Court concerning the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople The Turkish Supreme Court in a recent judgment made a statement which casts doubt on the rights of the Ecumenical Patriarch that are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. Particular concern has been aroused by the fact that the Turkish Supreme Court’s statement was not essential for the resolution of the case that was before it. In this way, the Turkish Court has legally confirmed Turkey’s restrictive policy towards non-Muslim communities and the Ecumenical Patriarch. It should be pointed out that all the EU texts establishing the framework for Turkey’s prospects of membership underline the urgent need for successful progress with regard to resolving the severe problems facing the non-Muslim communities and the Ecumenical Patriarch. It is clear that a decision of this kind, particularly by the Turkish Supreme Court, constitutes an undoubted step backwards. How does the Commission explain the fact that its statement on this judgment completely ignores the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, which form part of the Community acquis, and in particular the provisions on the right to religious freedom, and what immediate steps does it intend to take with regard to the Turkish authorities?
