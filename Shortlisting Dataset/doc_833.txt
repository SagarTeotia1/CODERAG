Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (3 August 2010) According to Part IV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the British Indian Ocean Territory is an Overseas Country and Territory (OCT) associated with the European Union (EU). As such, the British Indian Ocean Territory falls under the Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the Overseas Countries and Territories with the European Union OJ L 314, 30.11.2001 ('Overseas Association Decision') and benefits from the association under the same conditions as the other OCTs. Nevertheless, the Commission would like to stress that Article 198 TFEU does not impose a series of absolute and unconditional obligations upon the EU. In the same vein, the Overseas Association Decision 2001/822/EC does not entail an obligation for the EU to undertake specific actions in every area of cooperation mentioned in that Decision with a view to each OCT’s economic and social development. Moreover, the association of the OCTs with the EU does not give rise to a positive obligation for the Member States to which the OCTs are linked to actively promote, at their level, the economic and social development of their own territories. For example, the fact that several OCTs no longer receive individual financial assistance from the related Member State does not constitute a violation of Article 198 TFEU.
