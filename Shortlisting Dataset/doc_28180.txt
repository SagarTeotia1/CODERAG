WRITTEN QUESTION E-4458/09 by Kriton Arsenis (S-D) to the Commission (23 September 2009) Subject: Illegal removal of sand in Achaia Recent inspections carried out by the local authorities in the prefecture of Achaia have found that thousands of cubic metres of sand and gravel have been illegally removed from the Liakatas torrent in Achaia. Local inhabitants have also complained about the opening of work sites and the location of building materials in various areas without prior authorisation and without consulting the local communities. In view of the above will the Commission say: Is it aware of these specific allegations? Is this illegal removal of sand in keeping with the Water Framework Directive (2000/60) and legislation on the protection of the environment and wetlands in general? Does it have any information on the illegal removal of sand, a phenomenon which is widespread in Greece?
