of the Council on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State (COM(2007)873 final of 11.1.2008 – 2007/0299(COD) ) Having regard to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts, and in particular to point 4 thereof, the Consultative Working Party, consisting of the respective legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, met on 24 January 2008 for the purpose of examining, among others, the aforementioned proposal submitted by the Commission. At that meeting The Working Party had 22 language versions of the proposal and worked on the basis of the French version, being the original language version of the working paper. , an examination of the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Directive 93/7/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State resulted in the Consultative Working Party’s establishing, by common accord, as follows: 1. In recital 3, the French word ‘ devant ’ should be replaced by the French word ‘ devrait ’ [This change does not affect the English version]. 2. In Article 16, after the words ‘ every three years ’, the words ‘ and for the first time in February 1996’ , which appear in the current version of Article 16 of Directive 93/7/EEC, should be reintroduced into the text, preceded and followed by commas. In consequence, examination of the proposal has enabled the Consultative Working Party to conclude, without dissent, that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance.
