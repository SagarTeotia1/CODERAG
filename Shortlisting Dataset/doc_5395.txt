On 15 April, new proposals from the US EPA were published, which also clearly point in this direction. Stage IV of these limit values is in line with the USA's endeavours in that it takes a harmonised approach. There is already widespread use of particulate filters which give a realistic indication of the particulate value and the review of the limit values for HGVs has clearly shown that it is possible to establish ambitious NOx limit values with current SCR technology.

On 15 April, new proposals from the US EPA were published, which also clearly point in this direction. Stage IV of these limit values is in line with the USA's endeavours in that it takes a harmonised approach.

Amendment 36 ANNEX I, POINT 1(e), INDENT 2 Annex I, Section 4.1.2.5. (new), new paragraph (Directive 97/68/EC) The following paragraph is added to the new paragraph 4.1.2.5.: Engines for use in inland waterway vessels Category: swept volume/net power (SV/P ) (litres per cylinder/kW) Carbon monoxide (CO) (g/kWh) Sum of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (HC+NOx) (g/kWh) Particulates (PT) (g/kWh) V1:1 SV≤ 0,9 and P>37 kW 5. 0 1. 5 0. 02 V1:2 0,9<SV≤ 1,2 5. 0 1. 5 0. 02 V1:3 1,2<SV≤ 2,5 5. 0 1. 5 0. 02 V1:4 2,5<SV≤ 5 5. 0 1. 5 0. 02 V2:1 5<SV≤ 15 5. 0 1. 5 0. 02 V2:2 15<SV≤ 20 and P ≤3300 kW 5. 0 1. 7 0. 02 V2:3 15<SV≤ 20 and P>3300 kW 5. 0 2. 0 0. 02 V2:4 20<SV≤ 25 5. 0 2. 0 0. 02 V2:5 25<SV≤ 30 5. 0 2. 2 0. 02 Justification There is still very great potential for emission reduction in inland shipping, which must definitely be exploited on environmental grounds! In the Netherlands, for example, inland waterway vessels are responsible for 40% of total NOx emissions. SCR (selective catalytic reduction) technology, enabling 95% NOx reduction is available and is already in use on Swedish Baltic ferries and will be used for HGVs from 2008. A further stage for limit values (Stage IV) is therefore introduced for inland shipping. Amendment 37 ANNEX I, POINT 1(e), INDENT 2 Annex I, Section 4.1.2.5. (new), new paragraph to be added to the tables (Directive 97/68/EC) Under all randomly selected load conditions, the limit values in the above tables may not be exceeded by more than 100%. Justification To ensure that the limit values are not only selectively aligned but are also applicable at randomly selected test points during normal
