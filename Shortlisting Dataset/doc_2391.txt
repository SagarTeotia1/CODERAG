Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (16 May 2006) The Commission is aware of the situation in Greece where two patients were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during blood transfusions with blood from the same donor in August 2005, and has been in contact with the competent authorities. Directive 2002/98/EC OJ L 33, 8.2.2003. of the Parliament and of the Council lays down standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components in order to ensure a high level of human health protection. This Directive and Commission Directive 2004/33/EC Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 implementing Directive 2002/98/EC of the Parliament and of the Council as regards certain technical requirements for blood and blood components, OJ L 91, 30.3.2004. cover the criteria for the testing of blood donations in order to minimise the risk of transmission of infectious diseases. Testing of blood donations for HIV is explicitly mentioned as a requirement, but no molecular testing is required. According to the directive, it is therefore not an obligation for Member States to use the new nucleic acid amplification (NAT) method, rather than standard HIV antibodies detecting tests. Concerning the transposition of Directive 2002/98/EC in Greek law, a new law for the reorganisation of blood transfusion services in Greece, transposing Directive 2002/98/EC was adopted on 13 October 2005 and came into force on 17 October 2005. These national transposition measures were notified to the Commission on 21 November 2005 and are being checked against the provisions of Directive 2002/98/EC and Commission Directive 2004/33/EC.
