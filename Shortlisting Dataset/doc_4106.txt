ORAL QUESTION H-0915/05 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Liam Aylward to the Commission Subject: Manning conditions for ferry and passenger services EU ship owners have a preference for employing Eastern European and third world labour which they remunerate at a cheaper rate than the laws of countries such as Ireland and the UK permit. Under the current EU legal framework, ship owners can avoid national employment and social protection legislation by re-registering their ships in other jurisdictions (e.g. the Bahamas), where international maritime legislation and regulations on the protection of workers are flouted. Furthermore these re-registered vessels are gaining a distinctive competitive advantage over their competitors, but at a stark cost to their employees. In order to tackle this serious problem, does the Commission intend to propose a directive on the manning conditions for passenger and ferry services operating not just between Member States but also with third countries?
