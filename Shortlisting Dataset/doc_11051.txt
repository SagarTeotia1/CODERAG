Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (11 July 2008) Turkish journalists and audiovisual actors receive financial support as part of the pre-accession assistance for Turkey. For example, for the year 2007 and 2008, the EU is funding the Rights Journalism project, which aims at raising and strengthening awareness for rights-based journalism among the journalist community and journalism students in Turkey; to promote quality and coverage of human rights issues, and to enhance journalistic standards and professional ethics. The project with an indicative budget of approximately EUR 192 000 (EU contribution EUR 146 000) started in July 2007 and envisages three concrete outputs: a functioning news and information website with daily updates; trained journalists and training programme; Quarterly Freedom of Expression Monitoring Reports.
