WRITTEN QUESTION P-1678/07 by Filip Kaczmarek (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (26 March 2007) Subject: Breach of competition rules as regards provision of funding under the operational programme for the development of eastern Poland Action 2.2 under Priority 2 of the operational programme for the development of eastern Poland covers aid measures for the construction, extension and fitting-out of buildings that host trade fairs and exhibitions. It is very likely that the aim of this action is to help Targi Kielce, a limited company, to expand. Kielce town council owns 99.63 % of Targi Kielce; the other 0.37 % of the company is owned by individuals and businesses. Targi Kielce is the second-largest company on the Polish trade fairs and exhibitions market, with a market share of around 19 %. Bearing in mind the situation with regard to Poland’s trade fairs and exhibitions market, there are fears that the use of financial aid allocated under the operational programme for the development of eastern Poland to expand Targi Kielce constitutes a breach of competition rules. Logically speaking, the aim of the operational programme for the development of eastern Poland should be to reduce inequalities between Polish regions, not to boost businesses that are already performing well. Under the programme, projects set up by the five provinces in eastern Poland will be able to benefit from funding to the tune of up to 85 % of the capital involved. If Targi Kielce is granted this aid, the other businesses on the Polish trade fairs and exhibitions market will not be able to enjoy the same development opportunities. In these circumstances, could the Commission state whether it believes that the provision of funding to Targi Kielce via the operational programme for the development of eastern Poland complies with the competition rules in force within the European Union?
