much integrated, and the production cycle is particularly short compared with other livestock sectors. Consequently, the European poultry industry can quickly adapt supply to demand and thus avoid building up large stocks if consumption declines. In the event of serious market disturbances directly attributed to a loss in consumer confidence, the Commission would be able to take exceptional measures in accordance with Article 14(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat, OJ L 282, 1.11.1975. . It was this new legal basis, added in April 2006 in order to protect the European poultry industry, which allowed the United Kingdom and Hungary to benefit from exceptional market support measures. As yet, no serious market disturbances have been reported by Member States (including those affected by avian influenza outbreaks) or market operators, and the average poultrymeat price is even exceptionally high for this time of year.
