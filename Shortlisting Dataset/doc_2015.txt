Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (15 March 2006) The site ES1200040 ‘Meandros del Nora’ has been designated by the Spanish authorities as a site of Community importance (SCI) under the Habitats Directive Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. . This site is included in the annex list to the Commission Decision of 7 December 2004 adopting the list of sites of Community importance for the Atlantic bio-geographical region, pursuant to Council Directive 92/43/EEC, with a surface of 62 hectares. As regards to the first and third question, it should be highlighted that Articles 6(3) and 6(4) of the Habitats Directive set out a series of procedural and substantive safeguards governing plans and projects likely to have a significant effect on a Natura 2000 site. The provisions contained in this article constitute a form of development regime, setting out the circumstances within which plans and projects with negative effects may or may not be allowed. Article 6(3) states that ‘any plan or project not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the site but likely to have a significant effect thereon, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects, shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implication for the site in view of the site’s conservation objectives’. Subsequent to the conclusions of such assessment, and subject to the sequential steps provided for in Article 6(4) of the directive, the competent authorities shall agree to the project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned, and, if appropriate, after having obtained the opinion of the general public. In relation to the second question, electricity transmission lines are covered by Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 . on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (the ‘EIA Directive’) as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 . and Directive 2003/35/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 OJ L 156, 25.6.2003 . . Under this directive, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment must be made subject to an assessment of their environmental effects prior to development consent. Under this directive, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is mandatory for new overhead power lines with a voltage of 220 kilovolt (kV) or more, and a length of more than 15 kilometres (km). Other overhead power lines must be subject to an EIA if national authorities determine, in a procedure called ‘screening’, that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment. Under Article 4 of the EIA Directive, screening must be based on a case-by-case examination, and/or thresholds or criteria set by Member States, and must take account of the criteria set in Annex III of the directive. As the Honourable Member does not specify the length of the electricity transmission line which is being constructed by Redesa it is
