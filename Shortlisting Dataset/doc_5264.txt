Question for written answer E-8016/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Fiorello Provera (EFD) (6 October 2010) Subject: UN Millennium Development Goals: Water Access — MDG 7 In September 2010, the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International issued a report entitled ‘The Anti-Corruption Catalyst: Realising the MDGs by 2015’. It warns that the failure by governments to address corruption is threatening the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Chair of Transparency International, Huguette Labelle, said: ‘Governance breakdowns and corruption are significantly slowing down progress towards the MDGs.’ In relation to water access, it states that in ‘developing countries corruption is estimated to raise the price of connecting a household to a water network by as much as 30‑45 %.’ A survey carried out by the organisation discovered that in Kenya, 87 % of respondents in Nairobi had witnessed examples of bribery in order to connect to the city's water network. It concludes that ‘wide-scale corruption in the sector means that achieving the MDG target of improved water access will cost an estimated USD 48 billion more than has been planned.’ An estimated 20‑70 % of lost resources would be saved in the water sector if transparency was widespread and corruption eliminated. The EU provides almost EUR 1.5 billion each year for water and sanitation programmes in developing countries, making it the biggest donor. For example: between 2000 and 2007, the EU gave EUR 475 million to support government water and sanitation programmes in 16 ACP countries. In the light of Transparency International's findings, what oversight measures is the Commission prepared to adopt to ensure the equitable and fair distribution of water and sanitation projects within recipient states?
