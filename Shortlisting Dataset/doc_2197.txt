Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (29 October 2010) Free movement of persons constitutes one of the fundamental freedoms of EU citizens. This right is not unconditional. Chapter VI of Directive 2004/38/EC Directive 2004/38/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, OJ L 158, 30.4.2004. authorises Member States to deny entry or expel EU citizens and their family members but makes this subject to rigorous material and procedural safeguards. The wording of Article 27(2) of the directive develops the wording of previous EC law Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the coordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign nationals which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, OJ L 56, 4.4.1964. in the light of rich case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, starting as early as in the 1960s. It provides a tighter definition of the central notion of conduct of the person concerned respecting the fact that the concept of public policy or public security may vary in Member States and in time. In July 2009, the Commission adopted guidelines COM(2009)313 final. for better application of the directive to offer information and assistance to both Member States and EU citizens on the issues identified as problematic in transposition or application. Section 3(2) of the document provides guidance on Article 27(2) of the directive and the matter raised by Honourable Member and aims to allow Member States to better understand EC law and the case-law and apply it correctly while being able to protect both fundamental rights of EU citizens, on the one hand, and common and country-specific fundamental values on the other.
