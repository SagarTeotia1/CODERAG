WRITTEN QUESTION E-0757/08 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (15 February 2008) Subject: Pollution Residents in Arrifana (Santa Maria da Feira) have reported serious pollution of the air and of the water in the Ribeira da Lage which is caused by two industrial companies involved in the treatment of waste from animal processing, even though they are equipped with the technology to deal with waste water. Two workers at one of those companies recently died and another was seriously injured, owing to (according to the media) a failure to comply with basic safety rules relating to the control of gases inside the equipment in question. In view of the above facts, will the Commission answer the following questions? 1. Is there any programme to support the continuous and systematic monitoring of waste-water treatment systems, including underground water courses in areas regarded as critical? 2. Is there also any support for monitoring the procedures for storing and treating hazardous materials stemming from the operations of factories and their equipment? 3. Has any Community support been made available to the Rogério Leal e Filhos SA and Luís Leal e Filhos SA companies in Arrifana (Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal)? If so, under what terms and conditions? 4. Is any Community support to be made available for the local people affected by this state of affairs?
