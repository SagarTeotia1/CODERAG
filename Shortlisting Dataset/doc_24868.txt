9999/C Q999 E/081 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1430/04 by Paul Lannoye (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (15 April 2004) Subject: Cogema production capacity With a series of decisions taken on 10 January 2003, the French Government authorised an increase in the production capacity of the Cogema plants in La Hague and the reprocessing of new types of fuel, which are richer in plutonium. Articles 20-I and 21-I of the decree of 10 January allow the disposal of large quantities of both chemicals (particularly nitrates) and radionuclides, not only at sea but also in slow-flowing streams and in the atmosphere. Did the French Government provide the Commission with general data relating to this disposal of radioactive waste in line with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty? Article 6 of Directive 96/29/Euratom OJ L 159, 29.6.1996, p. 1 . also requires Member States to ensure that the exposure of individuals to radiation as a result of a new or modified practice is justified. Has any justification been provided and on what is it based? Does the Commission consider that the increase in waste envisaged in La Hague is compatible with the OSPAR Convention, which binds the European Union and France? One of the Convention's aims is in fact a scheduled reduction of all radioactive waste until it is completely eliminated.
