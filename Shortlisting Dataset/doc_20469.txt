Question for written answer E-6140/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) (27 July 2010) Subject: Action taken following the 2009 EU declaration on Palestine In December 2009, in a joint statement issued by the 27 EU countries, the ministers for foreign affairs, meeting in Brussels, expressed serious concern at the lack of progress in the Middle East peace process. The document states that, if there is to be a genuine peace, a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states. More than six months after this statement was issued, can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. What action has the EU taken to support the creation of a Palestinian state, free from Israeli occupation, with its capital in East Jerusalem? 2. Bearing in mind that a significant volume of Israeli exports comes from settlements in the occupied territories, where all the rights of Palestinians are known to be disregarded, is the Commission considering the possibility of blocking the entry into the EU of products from this source?
