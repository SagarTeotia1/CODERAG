Question for written answer E-000185/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kinga Göncz (S&D) (25 January 2011) Subject: Closure of private pension funds in Hungary The Hungarian Government is nationalising the investments in private pension funds of 3 million Hungarian citizens, valued at EUR 10 billion. It is using the invested money to finance the national debt and current expenditure. Those who remain affiliated to private pension funds are being robbed of their state pensions, while employers continue to pay contributions in the same proportion in the form of taxation. 1. Does the State's expropriation of the investments in private pension funds violate the right to property, in that the legislature is failing to give members of private pension schemes any real choice? 2. Does it violate the prohibition on adverse discrimination if the legislature discriminates in the pension entitlements which it vests in people who have made similar contributions to the financing of the pension system? Does the Commission wish to encourage Member States to ensure that their decisions on the pension system are in the interests of medium- and long-term monetary stability and not merely of a one-off reduction in the national budget deficit? If the Commission is noting the decision of the Hungarian Government to nationalise pensions, in what form does it consider that the EUR 10 billion accruing to the State should be accounted for: — as a one-off reduction in the national budget deficit? — as a reduction in the deficit spread over subsequent years in proportion to the actual pension payments made? — as a retrospective reduction in the deficit in those years when the money actually accrued to the [pension] funds?
