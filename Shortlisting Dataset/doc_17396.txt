Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2012) The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that currently the only additional requirement — compared to a normal tyre — a winter tyre has to meet is bearing the sign ‘M+S’ as laid down in Council Directive 92/23/EEC on tyres relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting OJ L 129, 14.5.1992, p. 95. . Preparatory work has already been done at UN-ECE to include functional requirements — such as snow-gripp — into type-approval legislation. The Commission considers that the establishment of functional requirements should be concluded before reflecting on a possible compulsory seasonal use of winter tyres.
