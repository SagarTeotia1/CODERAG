With profound changes in Europe's population structure, demographic change is high on the European policy agenda. Eurostat, the Commission statistical agency, expects the EU population, standing at 495 million on 1 January, 2008, to rise to 521 million in 2035. The UK population is predicted to become the largest in the EU, reaching 77 million by 2060. France and Germany will come second and third with populations reaching 72 million and 71 million respectively by the same year . However, countries facing the largest population increases are Cyprus (+66%), the Irish Republic (+53%), and Luxembourg (+52%). Challenges related to demographic change Problems facing the EU include an ageing population, low fertility rates, and high unemployment levels, according to a 2007 report by the Commission entitled Europe’s demographic future: facts and figures on challenges and opportunities . "Demographic change will gradually limit the scope for future employment growth," the report said . Similarly, Eurostat figures for 2008 to 2060 point to a projected decrease in the number of births, and an increase in those aged between 65 and 80 (from 17.1% to 30%). The agency also predicts that there will be almost three times as many people aged 80 and more in 2060 (4.4% in 2008 to 12.1% in 2060). European Parliament calls for action In 2004, the European Parliament requested that the Commission carry out a "preparatory action to encourage account to be taken of demographic change in European and national policies". On this basis, the Commission commissioned five studies from 2005 to 2006 to examine how current and projected demographic trends are affecting society and to promote pro-active policy responses in a wide range of areas.
