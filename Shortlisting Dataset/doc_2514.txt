Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (2 February 2011) The Honourable Member will find in a table, which is sent directly to him and to Parliament's Secretariat, the structural funds payments and N+2 de-commitments for the 2000‑06 programming period, for the East German Länder (with a breakdown by fund according to Länder ). As the 2000‑06 programmes are in the process of being closed, the final figures for the financial absorption of the Funds are not yet known. Prior to the final closure, interim payments for the programming period are limited at 95 % of the total commitment for each programme; the remaining 5 % are withheld pending closure. N+2 de-commitments correspond to the relevant yearly tranche in total; there is, therefore, no calculation at priority or target level.
