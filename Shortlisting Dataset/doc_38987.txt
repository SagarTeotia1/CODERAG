Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (11 November 2011) The Commission would like to clarify that ‘rescue funds’ or ‘stabilisation mechanisms’ for euro-area Member States have been created already. The Commission has been instrumental in the development and implementation of the two temporary funds created in May 2010 — the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). The Commission has also been instrumental in discussions leading to the development of a permanent fund — the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) — which is intended to take over these responsibilities in mid‑2013 at the latest.
