Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2011) The Commission services have clarified, in a note to the Technical Committee on Motor Vehicles (TCMV) dated April 2009, that as from 1 January 2011 no new type-approval can be granted for vehicles with mobile air-conditioning system using, as a refrigerant, fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150. This should apply irrespective of whether the vehicle air-conditioning system has been type-approved before and the manufacturer has thus presented this system type-approval in his application for a whole vehicle type-approval. This principle should apply irrespective of the procedure to be followed for the whole vehicle type-approval. The information provided above has been communicated by the Commission both to the Member States and stakeholders on several occasions, the latest being the meeting of the TCMV of 8 February 2011. Member States were asked to transmit the information contained in the note to the Technical Committee on Motor Vehicles to their national type-approval authorities. As for the situation with regards to the global warming potential of the actual gases now being used in the air-conditioning systems of new types of motor vehicle, the Commission has no knowledge of any new type approval procedure regarding vehicles with mobile air-conditioning system using an alternative to fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, nor does it possess any data on what that alternative will be. However, the Commission considers this issue to be extremely important and will continue to follow it closely, on the basis of the information gathered from the stakeholders and the Member States, whose competent authorities are responsible for market surveillance.
