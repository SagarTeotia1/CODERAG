Regional Development Fund have targeted in particular the economic diversification of regions by stimulating innovation and sectoral modernisation, in particular through support for SMEs and the promotion of entrepreneurship. Finally, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGAF 2007‑13) is a new instrument which provides support to workers made redundant as a result of serious economic disruption, notably in the event of substantial increase of imports into the EU, a rapid decline of the Community market share in a given sector or a relocation of production to third countries. Up to EUR 500 million will be provided each year to sectors and areas where major structural changes lead to serious economic disruption. EGAF can be activated by a Member State’s request for active labour market measures such as: counselling; job search and mobility allowances; new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills and other forms of training; and entrepreneurial support, including micro-credits. With respect to paragraphs 23 and 45 of the Parliament’s resolution, the Commission does not foresee any specific European textile plan which would introduce specific budget or specific assistance for the textile and clothing sector. The Commission believes that participation of the textile and clothing sector in multisectoral programmes (at national or European level) should provide more adequate and more efficient support than specific sectorial programmes. While applying the horizontal policy, the Commission nonetheless addresses specific needs of an individual industrial sector and deals with specific circumstances under which the sector in question operates. Accordingly, within the Mid-term Review on Industrial Policy, the Commission has addressed specific needs of the textile and clothing sector in the context of horizontal initiatives.
