Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (14 October 2010) The Commission is aware of the issue and its importance for the Greek Orthodox community in Turkey. This issue has been raised consistently with the Turkish authorities at all appropriate levels. The re-opening of the Halki (Heybeliada) Greek Orthodox seminary was, and continues to be, widely debated in Turkey. Recently, there have been positive statements by senior government officials on the possibility of re-opening the seminar. The Commission is indeed hopeful that it will be possible to address the matter sooner rather than later allowing, thus, for the training of clergy of the Greek Orthodox community and will continue to follow the matter closely.
