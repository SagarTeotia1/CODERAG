that the Charter be promoted by a campaign organised jointly at European and national level to publicise the commitments undertaken ; calls for adequate financial resources to be committed also by the Community Institutions and for a strengthened communication strategy to be developed so as to attract the interest of a greater number of players, such as SMEs, and to disseminate best practice in each field; calls for yearly road safety awards to be given to best performers at highly publicised events; invites the Commission to study the possibility of reaching individual citizens by means of personal road safety commitments; 12. Stresses the importance of the buyers of transport services participating actively in the work to improve road safety and calls on the Commission to do everything it can to ensure that buyers of transport services demand that their suppliers meet road safety requirements; calls on the European, national, regional and local bodies responsible to require a plan of action in the area of road safety from the undertakings from which they buy transport services; calls on the Commission to do what it can to ensure that the European road safety charter serve to issue transport undertakings with a certificate certifying that they meet the road safety requirements; 13. Is convinced that only an integrated approach involving all aspects of road safety, namely all road users and all users and purchasers of transport services and especially the driver (physical condition, training, behaviour), the vehicle (its equipment, safety regulations, maintenance) and the infrastructure (condition and maintenance of road networks, the intensity of road use, road building, signs) – together with incentives to make greater use of public transport – and effective legislation in the Member States, can lead to significant and lasting results; 14. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and their regional authorities to focus their road safety education, legislation and control measures on higher-risk groups; 15. Considers that thorough and high-quality training for drivers, instructors and law enforcement officers is of great importance; calls on the Commission to promote training, as early as in primary schools so as to reduce the death rate among the young, as well as life-long driver education with due regard to the needs of specific groups such as the elderly, disabled people or immigrants; supports Community-wide campaigns especially targeting the most frequent offenders and putting emphasis on the most serious causes of death such as speeding, drink-driving or the failure to use seat belts; calls for the rapid introduction of the European driving licence not least with a view to enabling the physical and mental faculties of drivers and their driving skills to be checked over time; 16. Expressly supports the Commission's efforts to investigate, in the area of commercial freight transport, the impact of the increasing use of small commercial vehicles on road safety in connection with training, driving and rest times and speed-limiting devices; calls on the Commission to forward the results of this examination to the European Parliament as quickly as possible, if necessary in conjunction with a legislative proposal; 17.
