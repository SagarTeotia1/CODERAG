ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0003/10 pursuant to Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure by Rolandas Paksas , on behalf of the EFD Group to the Council Subject: New developments in the CIA extraordinary renditions programme and secret prisons on EU soil (Lithuania) The findings of the investigation recently carried out by members of the Lithuanian Parliament show that at the instigation of a special agency of one foreign country, special detention facilities were established in Lithuania to hold detainees, while planes connected to the activities of the US Central Intelligence Agency took off from and landed at Lithuanian airports. Some of these planes were mentioned in the report of the EP Temporary Committee on alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners; however, the Lithuanian Parliament’s commission found out that even more planes connected to the same intelligence agency landed in Lithuania. In the light of these newly uncovered facts, would the Council consider that there is a sufficient legal basis to start a special investigation into the breach of the provisions of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions on the grounds of interference of a foreign country's intelligence agency into the affairs of a sovereign Member State of the European Union?
