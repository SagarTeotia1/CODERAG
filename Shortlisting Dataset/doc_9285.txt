Question for written answer E-6109/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Anna Záborská (PPE) (27 July 2010) Subject: COHOM 162/PESC 804: LGBT Toolkit and respect for national sovereignty On 8 June 2010 the Working Party on Human Rights of the Council adopted the Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of all Human Rights by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) People within its external action. The Council states on page 4 that ‘The EU unanimously supported the December 2008 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, supported by 68 countries from five continents.’ and uses this Statement as a basis for the purpose of the Toolkit. What is the legal value of the ‘Statement’ for EC law? Is a ‘Statement’ legally binding for EU Member States? How many of the 191 UN Member States have already signed the ‘Statement’? Has the ‘Statement’ been officially adopted by the UNGASS? If the ‘Statement’ has not been adopted yet, why does the Council refer to a non-adopted and therefore legally non‑binding document to shape its foreign policy?
