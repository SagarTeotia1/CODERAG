Question for written answer E-7267/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (14 September 2010) Subject: European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and Estonia The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) established by Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 OJ L 406, 30.12.2006, p. 1. is supposed to provide support for workers seriously affected by redundancies arising from the profound changes the European internal market has undergone in the last three years. Would the Commission state how many times the Fund has been mobilised on behalf of Estonia from 2007 to date? What are the sectors concerned? What is the total number of workers involved? What types of project have received support? What is the total amount of funding provided? What is the rate of reintegration into the Estonian employment market of workers who have benefitted from EGF measures?
