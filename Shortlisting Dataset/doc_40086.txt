Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2006) The objective of Directive 2001/77/EC Directive 2001/77/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market. is to promote the increase of the share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the EU. Tallow is included in the definition of a renewable energy source as it is considered biodegradable biomass. It is the view of the Commission that energy recovery from waste should be considered as a renewable energy source if it fulfils the definition of renewable energy sources according to Article 2 in Directive 2001/77/EC. In accordance with Directive 2001/77/EC, it is up to the Member States to decide on which renewable energy sources and which renewable energy technologies they wish to give subsidies to for electricity production. It is desirable that Member States consider, when designing their support mechanisms for renewable electricity production, possible implications on other sectors. The objective of Directive 2001/77/EC has to be seen together with the waste management principles laid down in the Community waste strategy. Recital 8 of Directive 2001/77/EC states that where Member States use waste as an energy source, they must comply with current Community legislation on waste management, notably the waste treatment hierarchy (prevention, recycling, disposal (with or without energy recovery)). However, it should be taken into consideration that under some circumstances, due to technical, economic and/or social constraints, such as transporting waste over a long distance, energy recovery may be considered to be a better solution than recycling. In such cases, supporting waste, which is considered as a renewable energy source, may not be considered to undermine the waste treatment hierarchy.
