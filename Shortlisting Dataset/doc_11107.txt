Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (5 November 2010) Following the establishment of a process of dialogue between the Chilean Government and representatives of the hunger strikers, with the mediation of the Archbishop of Concepción, Ricardo Ezzati, the hunger strike undertaken by a total of 38 Mapuche prisoners ended in early October. The Chilean government has agreed to withdraw charges brought against the detainees under Chile’s anti-terrorist law; and has initiated legal reforms aimed at modifying the anti-terrorist law as well as the legislation that allows trials of civilians by military tribunals. The Commission is aware of the open letter signed by a number of Members of the Parliament and sent to President Piñera and to the Chilean Congress and Senate in September 2010. The Commission notes that the establishment of the abovementioned dialogue, and the agreement by the Chilean Government to withdraw charges brought against under the anti-terrorist law and initiate a series of legal reforms, indicates significant progress on the issues raised in proposals (2) to (5) of the open letter. As regards proposal (1) of the open letter, the Commission believes that International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No. 169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples provides a clear framework within which governments can develop policies to meet the specific needs of their indigenous citizens. The Commission continues to support and promote the rights of indigenous peoples in Chile through two projects aimed at facilitating the implementation of this Convention which was ratified by Chile in 2008 and entered into force there in September 2009.
