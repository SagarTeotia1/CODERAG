Question for written answer E-002776/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antonio Cancian (PPE) (22 March 2011) Subject: Ban on the carriage of goods by road in Austria The road haulage industry is a vital asset to the internal market, since it handles about two thirds of the total tonnage in the trade in goods within the EU. Over 80 % of this trade consists of international transport operations between Member States. That being the case, the EU plainly needs to support this key industry by removing the administrative obstacles that slow down and interfere with its smooth running. National measures imposing weekend vehicle traffic restrictions have a considerable impact on road transport economics. Under the Austrian Highway Code, in conjunction with federal government regulations, vehicles carrying perishable goods through Austria are prohibited from travelling at weekends if their loads also contain non-perishable goods. Market needs are such, however, that loads often have to be mixed. Does the Commission believe that this ban contravenes the right to move goods freely? Will it take steps to lift the ban, which is de facto denying access to the market to haulage operators transporting perishable products?
