decisions on the restructuring, transfer and closure of multinational companies not only lead to job losses, but also generate a climate of growing insecurity amongst workers and the public at large, G. whereas a considerable number of decisions are taken by the governing bodies of companies without prior consultation and thus constitute a breach of the Social Charter, the social protocol, Directive 75/129/EEC, as amended by Directive 92/56/EEC, Directive 94/45/EC, and the OECD and UN codes of conduct, H. mindful of the marked trend that has been observed towards diluting social systems in the race to secure investment from large companies, 1. Believes that the speedier introduction of new technologies and new organisational methods which are less labour-intensive makes restructuring a particular policy challenge, insofar as it compounds still further the huge difficulties already encountered by the EU in bringing down unemployment and fostering economic development; 2. Asserts that, unless they receive political attention, certain restructuring processes will fail to reconcile the three strategic aims of Union policy, in this case structural adjustment (aimed at increasing the overall competitiveness of European undertakings on world markets), social cohesion (aimed at spreading the costs and benefits of economic activity evenly) and sustainable development (Article 6 of the EC Treaty); 3. Notes that harmful fiscal competition amongst EU Member States is a contributory factor in company restructuring, frequently a zero-sum game, and that ever lower taxation of mobile factors of production is eroding national tax bases and thus making it necessary to switch the tax burden to less mobile sectors such as the working population; 4. Considers that aid from public funds ought to be tied to the signing of long-term employment and local development agreements with the management of the undertaking concerned; asks the Commission and Member States to withdraw the subsidies paid under aid programmes and to demand that those companies which fail to honour their obligations repay those subsidies; 5. Requests that the ongoing negotiations between the Commission and the Member States on the Structural Fund programmes for the period 2000-2006 include measures to combat ‘subsidy-shopping’, a process in which the most attractive subsidies are sought, thereby tying Community aid for undertakings to long-term commitments vis-à-vis employment and development in local, regional and outlying areas, and for the enforcement of these provisions to be subject to regular monitoring for which the Commission, the regional and local authorities and social partners should be jointly responsible; 6. Expresses its solidarity with all those workers who face redundancy as a result of restructuring and with the subcontractors concerned; regards as unacceptable the decisions by multinational companies registering substantial profits to close units and sack their workers en masse, whether this occurs in the EU or in third countries; 7. Draws attention to the fact that, in other instances in which collective redundancies appeared to present the sole solution to a company crisis, talks with the workers paved the way for alternative plans to be drawn up and jobs secured; stresses the need for talks with the workers with a view to finding alternative solutions such
