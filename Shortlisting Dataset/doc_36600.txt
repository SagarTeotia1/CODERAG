Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (23 June 2010) A considerable amount of funding is already targeted to the Danube Region via numerous EU programmes funding (e.g. approximately EUR 100 billion by Structural Funds 2007‑13). There are also other funding sources available, e.g. via international financing institutions (e.g. EIB: EUR 30 billion covering the 2007‑09 period), national, regional and local authorities. The EU Strategy for the Danube Region will propose to work towards aligning of this existing funding to the objectives it set out. Regarding the Structural Funds, many of the broad decisions on the programmes have already been taken. However, if agreement on content and approaches is reached in the context of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, existing funding opportunities, including the EU ones, can be better aligned to its actions and projects. Concretely, in many cases a simple modification of the selection criteria could be enough. In other cases a modification of a Priority Axis may be necessary. Given that alignment is the overall aim, coherence between the objectives of the national Strategic Reference Frameworks and the EU Strategy for the Danube Region should be realised.
