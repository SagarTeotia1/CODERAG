WRITTEN QUESTION E-1630/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (28 March 2007) Subject: UN Human Rights Council — Zimbabwe The UK is demanding that the UN Human Rights Council send a team of investigators into Zimbabwe to gather evidence on the ground about the brutality of Robert Mugabe's regime. The Human Rights Council will be asked to put together a team of investigators to visit Zimbabwe, although it is recognised that there is a strong chance that they will be refused entry. The Human Rights Council will also be asked to pass a resolution condemning this week's attack on the opposition party, and the UK will ask the EU to add the names of perpetrators of the violence to the lengthening list of senior Zimbabweans banned from Europe. The decision is a sign that patience with Mugabe across Africa, and particularly in South Africa, is wearing thin. Mr Mugabe remains defiant and has told Western nations to ‘go hang’ after the barrage of criticism that followed the heavy beatings of opposition leaders of the Movement for Democratic Change party. Does the Commission support the UK's proposal for a team of investigators to visit Zimbabwe? Will the Commission be actively lobbying for support for the proposal within the UN Human Rights Council, particularly amongst the African member states? Does the Commission support the UK's proposal for the EU to add the names of perpetrators of the violence to the lengthening list of senior Zimbabweans banned from Europe? What other initiatives is the Commission considering to end the catalogue of human rights violations in Zimbabwe?
