Reply (8 December 2003) The EU strongly supports the diplomatic efforts undertaken by the six parties to achieve a solution to the North Korean proliferation issue. The EU hopes that the process will soon lead to concrete steps to lower tension in the region, including progress towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, a matter of fundamental interest to the whole international community. The EU remains willing to contribute to international efforts to move matters forward, and acts in close consultation with the main players. It is considering how it could give support to the multilateral talks in due course and in co-ordination with the capitals of the six countries involved.
