However, the Commission does not have any information on the proceeding lodged by the petitioner by a court in The Hague related to the custody of O. It seems that The Hague Court has requested to the petitioner a DNA sample in order to verify if he is really the biological father of O. but he has not agreed, having considered this request as an infringement of his human rights. The Commission has already asked the petitioner to provide the acts of the proceeding regarding the custody of O. in order to assess any possible violation of the European Union acquis.
