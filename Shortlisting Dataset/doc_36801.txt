Question for written answer E-009748/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Cecilia Wikström (ALDE) (27 October 2011) Subject: VP/HR — Imprisoned Swedish journalists in Ethiopia Since 1 July, two Swedish journalists, Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson, have been imprisoned in Ethiopia facing terrorism charges. Schibbye and Persson risk up to 20 years in prison if convicted. They have also been accused of entering the country illegally, a crime to which they have pleaded guilty. Ethiopia has the second-highest number of jailed journalists in Africa. The situation in Eritrea is even worse. The Swedish citizen Dawit Isaak has been imprisoned there since 2001. It is also problematic that the judicial process and information on how the trial will be performed in Ethiopia is rather inaccessible. 1. What can the High Representative do to assure that Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson will receive a fair trial in accordance with international standards? 2. What is the High Representative doing to protect journalists from EU Member States, such as Martin Schibbye and Johan Persson, and the possibilities they have to perform their duties and promote the freedom of the press throughout the world?
