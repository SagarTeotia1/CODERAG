House to avoid sloppy language which implies sloppy thinking. Equating fundamentalism automatically with terrorism is sloppy thinking. There are, he said, millions upon millions of Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims who believe literally in the old testament, in the new testament and the Koran, but they are not terrorists. There are a tiny number of people who have a literal reading of their religion who are involved in terrorism. We have, he concluded, to address why that is the case. Council response Summing up, Manuel LOBO ANTUNES sought to reassure MEPs as to the Portuguese Presidency's readiness to co-operate with Parliament in this "difficult and complex debate".The debate had brought forth praise as well as criticism. Some had wanted counter-terrorism policy to advance, others to retreat, but everyone agreed on the need resolutely to fight this scourge. Mr Lobos Antunes also stressed that new threats require willingness to learn, improve counter-terrorism methods, including deeper international co-operation and act to prevent further outrages. But the fight must be fought with full respect for our values and principles. He concluded by reiterating the hope that a new counter-terrorism co-ordinator would be appointed soon.
