Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (5 December 2006) In the framework of the temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry, an amount of at least 10 % of the restructuring aid which is granted to an undertaking producing sugar or inulin syrup has to be given to the growers of beet, cane or chicory and to the machinery contractors having worked for these growers. The aim is to compensate growers as well as machinery contractors for losses resulting from the closure of factories producing sugar or inulin syrup, and, in particular, for the loss of value of investments in specialised machinery. After consultation of the interested parties, the Member State has to determine if the minimum percentage of 10 % should be increased, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, taking into account the losses resulting from the restructuring process. This flexibility was introduced by the Council in order to allow Member States to take structural particularities in the regions concerned by the restructuring process into account, without jeopardising the overall balance of the restructuring plan of the undertaking. Therefore, at this stage, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to set a standard percentage for growers in all Member States.
