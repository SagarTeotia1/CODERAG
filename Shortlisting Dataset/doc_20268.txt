made by the Internal Auditor before Parliament's competent committee on 14 September 2006 that smaller agencies should be authorised to buy in internal audit services from the private sector; Evaluation of agencies 27. Recalls the joint statement by the Parliament, the Council and the Commission Council document DS 605/1/07 Rev1. negotiated at the conciliation before the ECOFIN budget Council of 13 July 2007 calling for (i) a list of agencies which the Commission intends to assess, and (ii) a list of the agencies already assessed, together with a summary of the major findings; Disciplinary procedures 28. Notes that, because of their size, individual agencies have difficulty in setting up ad hoc disciplinary boards composed of staff at the appropriate career grade and that the Commission's IDOC (Investigation and Disciplinary Office) is not competent for agencies; calls on the agencies to consider an inter-agency disciplinary board; Draft interinstitutional agreement 29. Recalls the Commission's draft Interinstitutional agreement on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies ( COM(2005)0059 ), which intended to create a horizontal framework for the creation, structure, operation, evaluation and control of the European regulatory agencies; notes that the draft represents a useful initiative in the effort to rationalise the creation and running of agencies; notes the statement in the Commission's 2006 synthesis report (paragraph 3.1, COM(2007)0274 ) that although progress in negotiations stalled after the proposal's publication, discussions on the substance were relaunched in the Council at the end of 2006; regrets that it has not been possible to make further progress towards adoption; 30.

Notes that for the financial year 2006 the Court of Auditors once again found high carry-over rates (43 % for administrative expenditure (Title II) and 45 % for operating activities (Title III)); 33. Draws attention to the fact that, although the Court of Auditors confirmed that in the financial year 2006 the Foundation complied in all essential respects with the provisions relating to reliability, there were a number of failings, not least as regards the budget annuality rule, the award of two contracts, the fact that amounts to be disbursed in full in 2007 were budgeted for in 2006, and the failure to observe the selection criteria applying to officials, thus raising the suspicion that transparency and non-discrimination may not have been guaranteed while procedures were taking place; 34.
