Reply (8 March 2004) Following the European Union's decision to initiate a renewed political dialogue with the Government of Sudan (GoS) in 1999, meetings take place in Khartoum to assess the progress in the areas of the dialogue (human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the peace process). Recent focus has been on the peace process. The outcome of these discussions is reflected in a joint EU-Sudan communiqué referred to by the Honourable Member of Parliament in his question as the agreement of 10 December 2002. On 3 September the GoS and the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), under the auspices of the Chadian President, agreed on a cease-fire in Darfur. As regards the clashes between rebel forces and the GoS armed forces in Darfur the Council has no information on the use of toxic gases . Nonetheless, the Council is aware that the fighting in this region resulted in humanitarian disaster. Despite interruptions during summer, the peace negotiations have moved forward meanwhile and an agreement on security arrangements was reached between the GoS and the SPLM/A on 24 September. Both parties also agreed to extend the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the cessation of hostilities up to 30 November 2003. The EU encouraged both parties not to lose momentum in order to reach a final and comprehensive agreement as soon as possible. The EU is coordinating its diplomatic activities in particular with IGAD, within the IGAD Partner Forum, the UN and the US according to its approach towards Sudan that all international actors should work together in order to maximise the chances for a comprehensive peace agreement. The Council believes that negotiating a comprehensive peace deal between the GoS and the SPLM/A is the only way to stop the 20-year conflict. It will continue to accompany Sudan on the path of peace building, respect of human rights, democracy and development.
