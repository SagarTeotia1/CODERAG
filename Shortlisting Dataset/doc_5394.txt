below that expected on the applicable emission test procedures'. Justification To ensure that the limit values are not only selectively aligned but are also applicable at randomly selected test points during normal operation. Amendment 31 ANNEX I, POINT 1 (e), INDENT 1 Annex I, Section 4.1.2.4. (new) (Directive 97/68/EC) e) Section 4 is amended as follows: - The following section 4.1.2.4 is added: e) Section 4 is amended as follows: - The following section 4.1.2.4 is added: '4.1.2.4. The emissions of the carbon monoxide, the emissions of the sum of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen and the emissions of particulates obtained shall for stage IIIA not exceed amounts shown in the table below:' '4.1.2.4. The emissions of the carbon monoxide, the emissions of the sum of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen and the emissions of particulates obtained shall for stage III not exceed amounts shown in the table below:' Justification For greater clarity, Stage IIIA becomes Stage III and Stage IIIB becomes Stage IV. This also makes clear that Stage IV is a further genuine reduction stage with new requirements. Amendment 32 ANNEX I, POINT 1 (e), INDENT 1 Annex I, Section 4.1.2.4. (new) (Directive 97/68/EC) The following paragraph is added to the new paragraph 4.1.2.4: Engines for use in railway cars and locomotives Category: net power (P) (kW) Carbon monoxide (CO) (g/kWh) Sum of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (HC+Nox) (g/kWh) Particulates (PT) (g/kWh) R1: 130 kW < P < 560 kW 3. 5 4. 0 0. 2 Category: net power (P) (kW) Carbon monoxide (CO) (g/kWh) Hydrocarbons and (HC) (g/kWh) Oxides of nitrogen (Nox) (g/kWh) Particulates (PT) (g/kWh) R2: P > 560kW 2. 0 0. 5 6. 0 0. 2 Justification Inclusion of rail vehicles from Stage III, differentiating between those below(R1) and those above (R2) 560 kW. Amendment 33 ANNEX I, POINT 1(e), INDENT 1 Annex I, Section 4.1.2.4. (new), under tables (new) (Directive 97/68/EC) Under all randomly selected load conditions, the limit values in the above tables may not be exceeded by more than 50%. Justification To ensure that the limit values are not only selectively aligned but are also applicable at randomly selected test points during normal operation. Amendment 34 ANNEX I, POINT 1(e), INDENT 2 Annex I, Section 4.1.2.5. (new), (Directive 97/68/EC) 4.1.2.5. The emissions of the carbon monoxide, the emissions of the sum of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen and the emissions of particulates obtained shall for stage IIIB not exceed amounts shown in the table below: 4.1.2.5. The emissions of the carbon monoxide, the emissions of the sum of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen and the emissions of particulates obtained shall for stage IV not exceed amounts shown in the table below: Justification A further reduction of particulates and NOx is possible and necessary. On 15 April, new proposals from the US EPA were published, which also clearly point in this direction. Stage IV of these limit values is in line with the USA's endeavours in that it takes a harmonised approach. There is already widespread use of particulate filters which give a realistic
