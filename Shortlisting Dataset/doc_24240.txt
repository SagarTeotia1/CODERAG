WRITTEN QUESTION E-5569/08 by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE) and Michael Cramer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (15 October 2008) Subject: EU‑wide recognition of a driving licence for agricultural tractors In recent years a range of measures have been taken to harmonise the individual Member States' systems of driving licences. National classes, although recorded on the driving licence, have not yet been harmonised in Community law. A driving licence class in one country can, for example, be called class ‘T’ (Tractor), which equates neither to a harmonised Community class nor a sub-class. In this case, the Member State in which the holder wishes to exchange their driving licence is not obliged to recognise the class. However, farms are often particularly reliant on freedom of movement for workers from other EU Member States. These workers should be authorised to drive agricultural tractors on public roads, when they have acquired an equivalent driving licence in their home country, so as to be a fully deployable part of the workforce. — Why was the tractor driving licence not taken into consideration when the EU decided on the single European driving licence in 2006? — Is the Commission aware of the difficulties faced by agricultural workers from EU countries in other Member States, where their driving licence for agricultural tractors from their home country is often not recognised? — When will the Commission put a proposal for an EU‑wide harmonisation of the driving licence for agricultural tractors (tractor driving licence) to the Member States? — What possibilities do Member States currently have for checking whether a driving licence for agricultural tractors gained in another EU Member State fulfils their own requirements?
