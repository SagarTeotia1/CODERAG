MFF. The margin under the heading 5 ceiling also includes EUR 76 million from staff contributions to the pension fund.

Table 1b sets out the payments in the PDB 2007. The overall total for payment appropriations is EUR 116 418 million, an increase of 3,9% compared to 2006. This is 0,99% of EU GNI . For payment appropriations, Annex I to the IIA sets a ceiling of 1,06% of EU GNI. There is therefore considerable margin remaining within the payments budget. 7. The working document now covers: the implications of the new inter-institutional agreement (IIA) for the 2007 Budget; the rapporteur's general comments; a summary of the PDB by MFF Heading; and a final section on horizontal issues, such as agencies, pilot projects and preparatory actions. The implications of the new IIA for the 2007 budget 8. The IIA between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on Budgetary Discipline and Sound Financial Management signed on 17 May 2006 paves the way for an orderly development of EU expenditure over the coming years. Although it foresees fixed annual ceilings for commitments and for payments, the MFF is not a multi-annual budget. Sufficient margin to allow the normal evolution of the annual procedure needs to be preserved. 9. Ninety percent of EU legislation for spending programmes terminates at the end of 2006, but not all future programmes will be fixed in 2007, and room should be maintained for new initiatives, annual actions, pilot projects and preparatory actions, and for support to EP's priorities. Most co-decision procedures setting up the new generation of programmes will be finalised at the end of 2006 or in early 2007: the 2007 budget will still offer an opportunity for fine-tuning and serve as leverage for the EP to secure its priorities in the ongoing legislative procedures. 10. A number of provisions set up by the new IIA will be implemented in the course of the 2007 budgetary procedure. The new legislative flexibility (art. 37) of 5% could be used to boost programmes that the EP considers to be positive priorities on the basis of an assessment by the Commission. The rapporteur is of the opinion that part of the margin could be used for that purpose, especially under headings 1A, 3B and 4. The rapporteur wishes to point out that the amounts entered into the PDB for multi-annual programmes remain indicative until the legislative authority has completed the procedures. Therefore, the resulting margins of the various headings could be significantly modified
