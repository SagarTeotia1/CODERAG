like SESAME (Mediterranean marine ecosystems), and PEGASO (integrated coastal zone management in the Mediterranean) by bringing together the scientific communities around this basin revealed to be an effective instrument in strengthening regional collaboration. Furthermore, management measures for sustainable fisheries taken at EU level and in the multilateral framework of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) will contribute towards the goal of the EU MSFD and to mitigation or elimination of unfavourable effects of fishing activities on marine habitats and marine living resources. In this respect, the proper implementation of the Mediterranean Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006) and of the measures adopted by the GFCM play a major role. The Commission and the EU Member States launched the Horizon 2020 initiative in Cairo in 2006 an integral component of which is the Mediterranean Hot-Spot Investment Programme (MeHSIP), which, in close collaboration with the Barcelona Convention has identified and addressed a number of pollution hot spots in the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Commission is working to reinforce existing cooperation and regular cross-sectoral dialogue with all Mediterranean coastal states along the lines of the communication ‘Towards an integrated maritime policy for better governance in the Mediterranean’ of September 2009 COM(2009)466 final. . The Commission believes that the measures to be undertaken, within an integrated approach to maritime policy, under the EU Marine Directive and the Barcelona Convention, the Mediterranean Regulation and the GFCM, carefully coordinated with global measures (such as the implementation of the biodiversity commitments undertaken last year in Nagoya), provide the appropriate framework for preserving the ever-threatened but still rich and valuable Mediterranean marine ecosystem. The effectiveness of current policies will obviously depend ultimately on the capability and willingness of the Mediterranean countries to implement them. In this respect the Commission believes that, rather than creating new structures, it is advisable to continue to provide assistance for correct implementation to the countries which need it and to the institutions which are essential for progress.
