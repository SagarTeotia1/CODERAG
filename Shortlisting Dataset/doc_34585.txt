(1) The text of Recital 11 should be changed to read as follows: ‘Even though it has not yet been possible to identify t he exposure threshold below which asbestos does not involve a cancer risk, the occupational exposure of workers to asbestos should be reduced to a minimum. ’ In the reference box preceding this recital, the reference to Recital 6 of Directive 91/382/EEC should be deleted.
