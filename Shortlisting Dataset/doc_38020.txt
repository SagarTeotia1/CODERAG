choose between being mothers and, for example, having management responsibilities. The middle class cannot afford to stay home too long without any kind of income and a long period away makes the return to the labour market more difficult. We make a balanced and sensible proposal, corresponding to the expectations of people, of families and of women. Moreover, working part-time may seem a good solution but when women reach retirement age, they find themselves penalised, exactly because they stayed home to take care of children or worked part-time. There are studies indicating that the gap between women and men's remuneration gets even bigger when retirement comes. Women’s poverty is greater in old age. What do you expect to be the future of paternity and maternity? We should promote and adopt more and more policies and measures aimed at the sharing of professional and public responsibilities. I defend paternity leave because it is not contemplated in European legislation, although it already exists in many member states, in order to fight the idea that the responsibility for the education and follow-up of children is exclusively female. In Northern countries, a man who does not share parental leave and is not present at home is considered a bad father. In the South, a man who takes parental leave is considered a bad worker. This will allow a better harmony, taking into account the children’s interests, women will be able to have children earlier and have the number of children they want, as studies indicate that Europeans don’t have the children they would like. I am for the sharing of all types of responsibility. 20100226STO69648 Committee vote 23 Feb: Extending maternity leave to 20 weeks fully paid Legislative Observatory Women's Rights and Gender Equality Committee Profile - Edite Estrela MEP Flickr photos EN 1 EUROPARL-TV http://europarltv.europa.eu/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf?vid=c7fdcf7c-28a3-462b-95ac-93f211e83f22&cid=0c8dedcf-1098-46c9-9b85-6f2b0f0b120d&lang=en&bitrate=512&loop=off&autoplay=off&startVolume=medium&showTitle=on&showBottom=on EN 3 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5697042 EN 4 LINK /members/public/yourMep/view.do;jsessionid=0194D159AFDA1BFF016ADCEF84749760.node2?language=EN&partNumber=1&name=estrela&id=28310 EN 5 LINK /members/public/yourMep/view.do;jsessionid=0194D159AFDA1BFF016ADCEF84749760.node2?language=EN&partNumber=1&name=estrela&id=28310 EN 6 LINK http://www.flickr.com/photos/european_parliament/4397485787/sizes/o/ -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20100223IPR69363 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN
