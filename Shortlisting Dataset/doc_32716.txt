WRITTEN QUESTION P-4621/05 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (5 December 2005) Subject: Reorganisation of translation service Commission officials have recently made statements in the media concerning a planned reorganisation of the Commission's translation service. In future, it is suggested, the service should retain only a hard core of 65 to 70 translators for each official language of the EU. Only for English, French and German should the number of translators range from 120 to 130. 1. What are the reasons for the reduction in the number of translators per country and what, very precisely, are the Commission's grounds for considering differences in the numbers of translators for the various languages to be justified? 2. Can the Commission give an assurance that any reorganisation will, at all events, not detract from the democratic rights of citizens to communicate with the European institutions in their own language? 3. Can the Commission give an assurance that these measures will not in any way detract from the translation of all official documents into all official languages of the EU or from the accessibility and quality of the Commission's external communications?
