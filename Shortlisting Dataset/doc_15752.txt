ORAL QUESTION H-0903/07 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Yiannakis Matsis to the Commission Subject: Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Cyprus Sheep and goats in Cyprus have already been affected by foot-and-mouth disease. Hundreds of animals suffering from this disease are slaughtered every day. Stockbreeding and stockbreeders in Cyprus and other related sectors have been affected and will continue to be affected in future. The same applies to the Cypriot economy: the impact of the disease will be catastrophic. What specific support measures and what compensation has the EU offered to date - or will it offer in future - to stockbreeders affected by the disease and how does it intend to assist the Republic of Cyprus? Has any specific plan been drawn up? If so, how has it been implemented - or will it continue to be implemented - in conjunction with the Republic of Cyprus?
