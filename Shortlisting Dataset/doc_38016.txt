Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (21 December 2007) The design of the new common sides of euro coins should not be seen as an exact geographical map but as a stylistic representation of Europe. It is, however, natural that all Member States figure in the design. Candidate Countries and other third countries, on the other hand, do not necessarily need to appear on the common sides of euro coins.
