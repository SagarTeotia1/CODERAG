Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (6 March 2012) Responsibility for enforcing food safety rules lies with the Member States, which are required to establish a comprehensive system of official controls to verify compliance with food law. In the case referred to by the Honourable Member, official controls seem to have indeed allowed the competent authorities to take action to counter identified violations. The Commission constantly monitors delivery by the Member States of their control duties, including through on-the-spot audits by its Food and Veterinary Office. It has not however engaged itself in enforcement of legislation in individual cases. The Commission maintains an EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), through which Member States report occurrences of direct or indirect risks to human health deriving from food. No notification of the cases in question was received, which should be taken as an indication that action by the competent authorities was sufficient to eliminate unfit or unsafe products from the market. In the specific case of fisheries products, the Control regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, establishing a Community control system to ensure compliance with the rules of the CFP. and its implementing rules simplify the application of control rules, in particular as regards the conditions for access to resources (fishing licences, fishing authorisations), the marking of fishing vessels and fishing gear, the vessel monitoring system, logbooks, electronic recording and reporting system and Union inspectors. These rules set out a traceability system for the control of fisheries products, which covers every stage in the chain that sees fish caught, landed, brought to market and sold and allowing inspectors to detect infringements at any stage of the supply chain.
