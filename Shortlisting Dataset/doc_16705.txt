Reply (18 October 2010) The Council has not discussed the issues raised by the Honourable Member. Article 47 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1 . provides the possibility for the Commission to take special market measures in respect of the cereals sector. The Honourable Member is thus invited to put this question, in the first instance, to the Commission.
