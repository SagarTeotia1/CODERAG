budget article 2 0 6 from EUR 13 500 000 to EUR 58 449 000; notes at the same time that Parliament faces similar problems; 7. Notes a 225 % increase in the initial appropriation for special advisers in the field of European security and defence policy (budget article 3 1 3); 8. Recalls the remark made in its resolution of 27 October 2005 on the draft general budget for 2006 Texts Adopted , P6_TA(2005)0410 . that the other institutions' budgets should cover administrative expenditure; 9. Finds that greater clarity with regard to spending on and by the EU Counter-terrorism Co-ordinator would enhance transparency; recalls that as a matter of principle operational expenditure should only be incurred by the Commission; 10. Urges the Council to improve its reporting capacity by making available at an early stage to the discharge authority, as all other institutions have done, including Parliament, the annual activity report referred to in Article 60(7) of the Financial Regulation, thereby contributing to the greater transparency of the institutions; 11. Notes that the Council is currently managing a project for the construction of the LEX building at an estimated cost of EUR 233 000 000 (at 2003 prices); 12. Recalls that in a letter dated 18 November 2004 concerning the 2003 discharge procedure, the Council declined an invitation to attend a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, citing the Gentlemen's Agreement of 22 April 1970; recalls further the Council's reluctance in previous years to give more than cursory answers to the questionnaire sent by the Committee on Budgetary Control to the other institutions by way of preparation of the discharge decision; believes that, in the context of the current compromise consisting in an informal dialogue between the Council and the competent committee's chairman and rapporteur, the competent committee should broaden the scope of its participation to include other Members wishing to contribute to this informal dialogue.
