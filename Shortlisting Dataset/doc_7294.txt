WRITTEN QUESTION E-2041/08 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (15 April 2008) Subject: Censorship of the site www.fiammatricolore.net It is impossible to access the official website of the Tricolour Flame Social Movement party (www.fiammatricolore.net) on the City of Milan's computer network. The site is, in fact blocked to navigation from that network, having been listed in the category ‘political extreme / hate / discrimination’. There are absolutely no items on that site liable to give rise to extremism, hate or discrimination. The author of this question is not only the National Secretary of the Tricolour Flame Social Movement party, but also a Member of the European Parliament democratically elected to the highest parliamentary body of the European Union, and that site also contains a link to his official website: www.lucaromagnoli.it . In the light of the above, could the Commission itself verify whether, on the sites in question, there is any censorable content damaging to the principles of the Community, and then take the appropriate steps to restore the rights of the author of this question and of the party he represents? Would the Commission not consider it appropriate to intervene in word and in deed with the competent Italian authorities?
