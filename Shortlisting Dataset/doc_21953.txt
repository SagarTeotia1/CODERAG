Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (20 September 2007) The Honourable Member refers to the Commission proposal for a new Common Market Organisation (CMO) Fruit & Vegetables COM(2007)17 final. which foresees the possibility for producer organisations to withdraw fruit and vegetables from the market. The Community contribution covers 100 % of both the raw material as well as distribution costs if the produce withdrawn is distributed for free to charitable organisations and foundations, to penal institutions, schools and public education establishments and to children's holiday camps as well as to hospitals and old people's homes. These initiatives are among the key tools to address specific groups in specific settings to counter overweight and obesity as envisaged by the Commission in its Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues adopted on 30 May 2007. In attempting to establish a concrete number of fruits which is being made available to school children in the Member States, several facts have to be taken into account: first, schools and public educational establishments are only one of several potential recipients; second, not only fruit but also vegetables can be withdrawn and subsequently distributed; third, producer organisations decide autonomously which produce at which moment in time to withdraw. Thus, any prediction on how much fruit will actually be distributed to school children under this scheme in the future remains highly speculative. In this context it seems relevant to mention that the Commission has been invited by a Council declaration to consider bringing forward a proposal for a School Fruit Scheme as soon as possible.
