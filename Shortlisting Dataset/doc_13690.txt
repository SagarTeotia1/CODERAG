Question for written answer E-007338/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Edite Estrela (S&D) (26 July 2011) Subject: Labour rights in Georgia In 1999 Georgia ratified ILO Convention No 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, and in 1993 it ratified ILO Convention No 98 on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining. Between 2009 and 2011, Georgia benefited from the EU's system of trade preferences (GSP+), partly as a result of its government's commitment to fully applying the ILO's core labour standards. Although the ILO-led procedure to launch a review of Georgia's legislation through social dialogue achieved some token results, it failed to bring about any changes in the country's labour code. The Joint Staff Working Paper by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in 2010, in its country report on Georgia recognises that ‘In the field of labour rights and core labour standards, ILO expressed concerns with the lack of compliance, by Georgia, with core labour conventions. If unaddressed, these concerns put at risk Georgia’s continuing inclusion in the EU’s General System of Preferences (GSP+) which allows Georgia to benefit from trade preferences from the EU’. The International Trade Union Confederation and the European Trade Union Confederation have repeatedly condemned the Georgian Government's anti-trade union policies. What steps does the Commission intend to take to ensure that labour rights are respected in Georgia, as required by the EU's General System of Preferences (GSP+)?
