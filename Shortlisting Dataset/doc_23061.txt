Question for written answer P-006350/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Diana Wallis (ALDE) (28 June 2011) Subject: Proposed tax on second homes in France for non-residents The French Government has recently proposed the introduction of a new tax for owners of unoccupied second homes located in France. The tax, set at 20 % of the cadastral value of the property, will be payable only by non-residents of France. Could the Commission confirm whether this proposal by the French Government conflicts with the principles of non‑discrimination set out in the treaties?
