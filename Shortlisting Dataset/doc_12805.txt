WRITTEN QUESTION E-2241/04 by Brice Hortefeux (PPE-DE) to the Council (29 September 2004) Subject: Abolition of one and two cent coins The debate over whether to scrap one and two cent coins is hotting up. Finland started the ball rolling in January 2002 when it decided not to produce the coins, and recently Belgium has announced that it may cease to mint them in 2005. Some, on the other hand, find the one and two cent pieces particularly valuable for small, day–to–day purchases and think that if the five cent coin becomes the lowest denomination, ‘rounding errors’ will lead to price rises. In my view, this concern alone is enough to justify allowing one and two cent coins to remain legal tender. Moreover, just as some countries had a tradition of large denominations and successfully fought for their introduction (the EUR 500 note was introduced at Germany’s request), it seems only right and proper that the requests of countries used to small denominations (i.e. one euro) be met as well. Italy made its request for one euro notes in a bid to stem inflation caused by the one euro coins losing their value. Psychologically, Europeans see coins as being worth less than notes. Although I realise that decisions on the issuing of banknotes are the ECB’s responsibility, I would nevertheless like the Council to outline its position on the matter.
