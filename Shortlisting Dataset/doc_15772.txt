can create the opportunities and spaces for dialogue needed to increase understanding and acceptance of diversity; to transmit values, prevent racist behaviour and foster tolerance. The recommendation on Key competences for lifelong learning adopted in December 2006 provide the basis for the implementation of a key concept of values by defining those competences needed for the ability to cope with the challenges of the 21st century, recognising the role of both, formal and informal education. These competences should be acquired by the end of formal schooling and updated through lifelong learning. Interpersonal and civic competence as well as cultural expression have been defined a key competence. Active Citizenship is closely related to multicultural education as it plays a key role in the development of identity, in promoting a more open attitude to others, combating racism, and fostering tolerance. The ‘Lifelong Learning’ Programme (2007‑13) is the key instrument for supporting Member States in developing and implementing adequate projects in all areas of lifelong learning from school education to adult education. Numerous projects, networks or exchange programmes have been funded in Member States, contributing to active involvement. A significant number of projects dealt with diversity and intercultural learning. These Community programmes have made it possible for thousands of citizens to increase their knowledge and to give them a direct personal experience of different cultures. The Commission's Youth policy has incorporated Active Citizenship as a key element. Through a broad range of initiatives youth participation can be fostered. There are for example numerous possibilities to use sports as a tool for strengthening tolerance. The ‘Youth in Action’ programme calls for increasing active involvement of young people. The Commission wants to emphasise the importance of these issues during the Year 2008, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
