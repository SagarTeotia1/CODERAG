WRITTEN QUESTION E-4065/09 by Rebecca Harms (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (10 August 2009) Subject: Whereabouts of waste from EU‑funded research projects Under research programmes, the EU subsidises projects which produce radioactive waste, and in the context of Euratom it operates installations which do likewise. 1. Does the Commission have any information about the whereabouts of radioactive waste generated as part of research projects initiated or funded by the EU? 2. Does the Commission have any information about the whereabouts of animal carcasses left by experiments co‑financed by the EU concerning the genesis of carcinomas between 1964 and 1967 at the Experimental and Training Centre for Radiation Protection in Munich-Neuherberg? 3. What sort of carcasses were these, what was their level of radioactivity and with what radionuclides were they contaminated? 4. What arrangements exist for the radioactive waste generated at the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) at the Karlsruhe Research Centre? 5. Where is this waste placed in temporary storage and where is it to be finally stored? 6. Are there comparable arrangements for other EU establishments in other Member States, and where is the waste from them located?
