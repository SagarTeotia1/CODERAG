Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (3 July 2006) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for his question and would like to stress that it is committed to religious freedom and to fighting all forms of discrimination worldwide. EU Troika partners, and the Commission in particular, are closely following developments relating to the situation of religious minorities, especially Christian Dalits, in India. The Commission maintains regular contacts with local and international organisations working on this issue. The Commission welcomes the recent visit in India, in February 2006, of the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on descent-based discrimination. The Commission also welcomes initiatives such as the recent introduction by the Government of India, in the Indian Parliament, of the Communal Violence Suppression Bill, which gives special powers to the central government to deal with communal violence in Indian states, including those affecting Christians. The EU is also following with particular attention the deliberations of the Indian Supreme Court on the discrimination of Christian Dalits. The Commission deals with this matter in the same way that it deals with all other questions concerning democracy and human rights in India, namely within the context of the regular constructive EU Troika — India dialogue. Its Delegation in Delhi, together with other EU embassies, will continue to carefully follow developments in this area.
