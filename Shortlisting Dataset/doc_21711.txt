WRITTEN QUESTION E-4841/07 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (4 October 2007) Subject: Projects to prevent floods and erosion in areas hit by fires According to scientific experts — and as recent experience has shown — areas in the prefectures of Elis, Arcadia and Messinia that were hit by forest fires are at direct risk of catastrophic flooding unless the necessary work is undertaken to prevent floods and erosion. Can the Commission provide the following information: 1. How much funding has been budgeted under the third CSF to carry out projects to prevent floods and erosion in the above areas? What stage has been reached in their execution (legal commitments — absorption rate)? 2. Which projects are showing the greatest delay? In the Commission's view, what are the reasons for the delays?
