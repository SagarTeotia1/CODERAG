on the removal of status violators, criminals and "inadmissible persons”, E. taking into consideration the fact that the USA has adopted some extraordinary acts such as the Patriot Act and the President's executive order on military tribunals, F. concerned that in some respects the American and European approaches are incompatible and that this weakens the common fight against terrorism, 1. Underlines that any international agreement on police and judicial cooperation signed by the European Union and its Member States must fully respect the ECHR and, consequently, the minimum procedural guarantees that are common to all Member States in their respective legal systems; the following principles, in particular, must be observed: - not to limit in a disproportionate manner data protection standards (even if under a sunset clause) on electronic surveillance provisions, - not to admit any discrimination between third-country and non-third country citizens that would be contrary to the ECHR, - to guarantee the protection of fundamental rights as regards the monitoring of communications between a prisoner and an attorney, - the procedural guarantees to a fair trial, as consolidated by the European Court of Human Rights; 2. Considers that the US Patriot Act, which discriminates against non-US citizens, and President Bush's executive order on military tribunals are contrary to the principles established above; 3. Considers that, such being the legal situation, legal problems could arise from the fact that the USA considers terrorists as war criminals, whereas this is not the case in the EU; considers that, therefore, no extradition could be allowed to the US from Member States for people who are to be tried before military tribunals; 4. Expresses concern at the fact that the President's executive order does not specify the limits on the court's jurisdiction, makes no provision for the presumption of innocence and the right to an impartial judge and, above all, allows sentences, including capital punishment, to be decided by a two-thirds majority; 5. Reiterates its request for a complete abolition of the death penalty in the USA and reminds Member States that they are bound not only on the basis of their individual ratification of Protocol 6 of the ECHR but also as members of the Union, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty; a general EU-USA agreement cannot therefore be reached; extradition cannot take place if the defendant could be sentenced to death; 6. Requests that expulsion or deportation proceedings should not be used as "disguised” extradition proceedings, and calls on the EU to guarantee European data protection standards that are proportionate, effective and of limited duration and to ensure that no mandatory retention of data be allowed, which would undermine rights and guarantees; 7. Asks for the European Parliament to be fully informed and consulted before the adoption of any EU-USA cooperation agreement in the field of JHA, and that the conclusion of such an agreement be conditional upon a ruling confirming its conformity with EC law, established by the Court of Justice; 8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments of the Member
