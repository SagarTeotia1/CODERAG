WRITTEN QUESTION E-3434/08 by Jim Higgins (PPE-DE) to the Commission (18 June 2008) Subject: EUETS and the alumina sector Can the Commission explain the non-harmonised treatment of the alumina sector under Phase II of the ETS? Moreover, how does the Commission intend to tackle the problem of distortions in the global alumina refinery market caused by the inclusion of EU-based installations in the aforementioned sector in the EUETS, whilst competitors from third countries will not have to purchase allowances in this scheme?
