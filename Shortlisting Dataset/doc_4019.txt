Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (14 June 2006) The Commission shares the objective of ensuring that hydrogen peroxide is used in tooth whitening products only under strict conditions which provide a high level of consumer health protection. As the Honourable Member stated in his question, the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic and Non Food Products concluded in 1999 that tooth whitening products should not contain more than 3.6 % of hydrogen peroxide SCCNFP/0058/098 of 17.2.1999 and SCCNFP/0200/99 of 23.6.1999. . However, the opinion in question was superseded by more recent scientific opinions on the same subject. In fact, following new submissions of scientific data, this Committee concluded in 2002 that ‘overall evidence indicates that the proper use of tooth bleaching agents containing 0.1 to 6 % hydrogen peroxide (or equivalent for hydrogen peroxide releasing substances) is safe if used under the supervision of a dentist’ SCCNFP/0602/02 of 17.9.2002. . The scientific committee which, from 2004 Commission Decision 2004/210/EC of 3 March 2004 setting up Scientific Committees in the filed of consumer safety, public health and the environment, OJ L66, of 4.3.2004. , has been called the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP), delivered two further opinions aiming at clarifying the notion of ‘supervision by a dentist’. The latest opinion was adopted on 15 March 2005 SCCP/0844/04 of 15.3.2005. and is the basis for the current proposal to modify Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products OJ L 262, 27.9.1976. . The Commission proposal to increase the level of hydrogen peroxide allowed in tooth whitening products is based on the latest scientific assessment from the scientific committee. The proposed authorisation is, in fact, time limited and includes labelling requirements and is accompanied by a strict monitoring mechanism. Therefore, this proposal fully reflects the precautionary principle.
