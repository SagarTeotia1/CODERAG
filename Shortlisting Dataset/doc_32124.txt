Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2003) The legal basis for Community action in the area of human health protection is Article 152 of the EC Treaty. The first paragraph of this article stipulates that where Community action complements national policies, the principle of subsidiarity applies. According to this principle, which is set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action only where the objectives of the proposed action can be better achieved by the Community. In the case mentioned by the Honourable Member, the Commission does not have a sufficiently sound and conclusive scientific basis to propose European legislation on this subject itself, rather than leaving it to the Member States. It is up to the Member States to adopt the necessary measures at national level in order to prevent accidents of this kind.
