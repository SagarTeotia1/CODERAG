WRITTEN QUESTION E-2377/04 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (7 October 2004) Subject: Procedure for setting the amount of glazing water in the fish sector At meetings with Portuguese industrialists in the frozen and deep-frozen fish sector, my attention was drawn to the need for identical standards in the various EU Member States on the procedure for setting the amount of glazing water across the whole of the fish sector. Recent legislation in Portugal, based on the official Portuguese method, sets the following tolerances for net drained weight: — up to 5% inclusive for cephalopods; — up to 4% inclusive for other products. However, official methods in other countries allow different values. 1. Can the Commission say what tolerances are permitted in official methods for determining the amount of glazing water for the whole of the fish sector? 2. What steps are being taken to protect consumers' rights and prevent unfair competition among producers?
