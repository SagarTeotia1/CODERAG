Answer given by Mr Figel’ on behalf of the Commission (11 July 2007) The Honourable Member stresses that the budget finally adopted for the Lifelong Learning Programme fell short of the Commission's initial proposal. However, just as the initial proposal had been based on a number of quantitative targets, these targets were correspondingly scaled back when the proposal was revised to take account of the compromise reached in co-decision. In the case of Erasmus, whereas it had initially been foreseen that the target of 3 million students would be achieved by 2011, the target year was deferred to 2012 in the revised proposal in order to reflect the reduced financial envelope. Furthermore, the level initially envisaged for the average monthly Erasmus student grant was reduced — from a profile growing to EUR 250 in the initial proposal to EUR 200 maintained constant in real terms in the financial statement annexed to the Commission's revised proposal. Finally, the budgetary provision for Erasmus special mobility grants — comparatively expensive grants of EUR 10 000 per capita per year to enable students to be supported during Joint Masters degree study — was completely removed from the revised proposal, while the action remained in the legal base itself to make it possible for such mobility to be supported in the future if additional funding for the programme should become available. The Commission's continuing commitment to attaining the target of 3 million students is therefore consistent with the revised budgetary framework for the Lifelong Learning Programme.
