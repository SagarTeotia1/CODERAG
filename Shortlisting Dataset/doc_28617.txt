Association Process should be pursued and extended as a policy corner-stone for relations with the Western Balkans; Neighbourhood policy 60. Underlines the high priority it attaches to the implementation of a comprehensive neighbourhood policy, aimed at developing a sphere of democracy, stability and prosperity in the countries bordering the Union to its south and east; calls on the Commission to review its concept in close cooperation with Parliament, with a view to allowing for further differentiation between the different geographic regions and countries; 2. 61. Considers it particularly important, in this context, to (i) develop a strong new Eastern dimension to neighbourhood policy and continue to send positive signals to Ukraine and other states as they develop stronger, functioning democracies; and (ii) to strengthen and deepen the existing Euro-Mediterranean dialogue and associated policies and, in particular, give new impetus to the Barcelona Process in the framework of the 10th anniversary of the Conference this year, and therefore analyse and, possibly, proceed with some revision of this process to ensure better efficiency of the system; 62. Calls, in particular, on the Commission to propose, and on the Council to consider, a further upgrading of the EU's relationship with the Ukraine, by providing for other forms of association, which would give a clear European perspective to the country and thus meet the expectations and hopes raised during the peaceful Orange Revolution; 63. Reiterates the need for the EU to develop rapidly its common neighbourhood policies in order to help its neighbours achieve liberal democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights as well as higher levels of social, economic and environmental development; 64. Takes the view that every possible effort should be made to achieve the reunification of Cyprus; calls on the Commission to strengthen inter-community projects, thus building up the momentum for the resumption of negotiations; Bilateral relationships 65. Attaches high priority to the further development of the EU's bilateral relationships, on the basis of agreements with third countries as appropriate; notes the importance of ensuring that relationships with Eastern and Mediterranean countries are strengthened accordingly, in particular through an enhanced structured dialogue in the framework of the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly; 66. Reiterates, in particular, its call for a strengthening of EU-US relations, by updating and replacing the existing New Transatlantic Agenda with a genuine 'Transatlantic Partnership', to be backed by a commitment to removing remaining barriers to trade and investment by 2015; recalls that a sincere and fluid dialogue is the natural basis on which to structure transatlantic relations and that the Transatlantic Legislator's Dialogue (TLD) is an appropriate tool for this purpose; notes the continuing need to conclude the EU-US Transatlantic Aviation Agreement, as an example of developing a genuine external transport policy; 67. Takes note of the Commission's intention to revisit the strategy towards Latin America and to launch a new approach to bilateral relations, and in this context underlines the need to relaunch the concept of a 'Bi-Continental Association' framework for relations between the two continents; 68. Believes that, unless and until there is a significant improvement
