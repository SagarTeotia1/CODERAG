Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (29 October 2010) The Commission would refer the Honourable Members to its answer to previous Written Question E‑6893/10 by Mr Christensen and Mr Jørgensen http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/home.do?language=EN , and would emphasise the fact that the principles governing the coordination of and priority rules for family benefits are not new and have generally been applicable for decades, be it under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community, OJ L 149, 5.7.1971. or Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the coordination of social security systems, OJ L 166, 30.4.2004. , which replaced the latter from 1 May 2010. What activity determines whether a Member State is competent is a matter for the social security legislation of the Member State in which such activity or equivalent situation exists See Article 1(a) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004. . The conditions for eligibility for social security benefits are also set by national law. However, such criteria must apply equally to all persons concerned. Persons to whom Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 applies are to enjoy the same benefits and be subject to the same obligations under the legislation of any Member State as the nationals thereof Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004. . Any distinction between children living in the country of origin and children living in the country of employment would be considered discriminatory and contrary to that regulation See also Article 67 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004. . A Member State whose legislation is applicable may not make the grant of a family benefit within the meaning of Article 1(z) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 dependent on the condition that the children are resident within its territory. The Commission can therefore confirm that there is EU legislation obliging the competent Member State to provide family benefits for the worker's family members residing in another Member State, and it would be an infringement of EC law to require that a worker's children should live with the worker in the host country in order to receive family benefits.
