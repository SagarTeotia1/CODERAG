Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (13 December 2011) The ‘appropriate steps’ that need to be addressed in the European retail sector are to be considered within the context of the ongoing work on this subject. Specifically, the Commission adopted in July 2010 a Retail Market Monitoring Report, which identified some 20 issues that are hindering its proper functioning in terms of its economic, social and environmental performance. In July 2011, the European Parliament adopted its own initiative report ‘On a more efficient and fairer retail market’ which flagged up issues it considered a priority to be tackled in order to make the retail sector more efficient and fairer. Following these reports, the Commission is currently focusing its work on the issue of unfair business to business commercial practices, which was one of the problems identified by both the Commission and the Parliament. Other than that, it is currently reflecting on possible steps to be taken to address the other issues that the retail sector is facing. However, the Commission is currently not planning to specifically address the issue of opening hours, which was raised in the Written Question E‑002767/2010 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB . None of the two reports mentioned above identified any malfunctioning specific to the Irish retail sector. The Commission wishes to stress that in the context of its work on unfair commercial practices between businesses, the issues linked to the fairness of commercial leases might be analysed.
