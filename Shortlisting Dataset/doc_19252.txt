Answer given by Mrs Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2008) Directive 2001/18/EC Directive 2001/18/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC, OJ L 106, 17.4.2001. foresees that Member States and the Commission have to ensure that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which contain genes expressing resistance to antibiotics in use for medical or veterinary treatment ‘are taken into particular consideration when carrying out an environmental risk assessment, with a view to identifying and phasing out antibiotic resistance markers in GMOs which may have adverse effect on human health and environment’. Considering the above and following a report published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) listing kanamycin and neomycin as ‘critically important antibacterial agents for human medicine and for risk management strategies of non-human use’, the Commission decided to consult the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) and subsequently the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (which had issued opinions in 2004 on antibiotic resistance genes in genetically modified plants and in 2005 for the placing on the market of the genetically modified starch potato EH92‑527) on the safety of the nptII gene. This process was finalised by a statement of the GMO Panel of EFSA that was adopted on 22‑23 March 2007. In this statement EFSA, having considered the EMEA opinion on the importance of the antibiotics for which nptII gene encodes resistance, confirmed its favourable assessment on the use of this marker gene and provided additional explanations underlying its assessment. The Commission, after due consideration of all the available information, decided to propose the authorisation of GMOs containing this gene. However, in the light of further scientific information on this matter, which became available recently, the Commission decided to refer the question further to EFSA and is currently awaiting the relevant scientific opinion.
