industry that is less and less dependent on public funds; 21. Considers that, given that fisheries is a common policy, fishing rights management mechanisms should be adopted at Community level that will make it possible to improve the management of fishery resources; 22. Believes that economic efficiency is valuable insofar as it promotes the objectives of the CFP; 23. Calls on the Commission accordingly to ensure that any studies which it initiates on RBM should be directed at: I. providing a full picture and analysis of the systems of management currently in operation within the Member States, II. looking at the basic understandings involved in RBM in terms of: a) to whom the rights may be allocated, to whom they may be transferred and whether they are tradable, together with any limitations in these respects, and b) the extent of the rights, i.e. whether they are defined in terms of location, quantity (output) or effort (input) or a mix of these, III. assessing, using the evidence acquired from the existing systems of management, the effectiveness of each such understanding in achieving the objectives of the CFP in terms of: a) improving the livelihoods of those engaged in the fishing industry, b) having a sustainable marine ecology in which fish stocks are conserved, c) maintaining the viability of fisheries-dependent communities d) the extent to which the system has, since its inception, concentrated ownership of the right to fish and led to loss of employment, and e) the economic efficiency of the fisheries sector, IV. examining these issues separately for different types of fisheries both inside and outside Community waters; 24. Urges the Commission to allow a longer period for debate on this issue; 25. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Regional Advisory Councils and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture.
