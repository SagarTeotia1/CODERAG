Question for written answer E-009434/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (20 October 2011) Subject: Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline and EU intervention On 15 March 2007 the governments of Russia, Bulgaria and Greece signed an inter-State agreement on the construction and operation of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline. In the two years since then, Bulgaria has given various signs of its lack of interest and indeed hostility to the project. More specifically, Bulgaria has consistently hindered the procedure for approving the studies evaluating the environmental impact of the Bulgarian section of the pipeline, as a result of which the same studies have had to be modified and resubmitted three times, after their initial approval, in an attempt to meet the excessive requirements set by the competent authorities. On 7 September 2011 the Commission published a communication on security of energy supply and international cooperation which sets out for the first time a comprehensive strategy for the EU's external relations in energy. It also adopted a common position that is of vital importance for protecting the energy interests of EU countries beyond their borders. Could the Commission look into the possibility of EU representatives participating in negotiations between the countries involved in this project in order to defend the EU's interests, as called for in the recent decision?
