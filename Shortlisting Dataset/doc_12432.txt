EU was urged to target better its sanctions on the Burmese junta. Least developed countries The report also stresses the situation of the least developed countries (LDCs) in the region: Cambodia, Laos and Burma. At present the Commission's negotiating mandate does not provide for negotiations with the LDCs. If these countries wished to join the free-trade agreement with the EU, the Council would have to revise the mandate it has given the Commission. For the other poorer countries who are members of ASEAN but do not belong to the LDC group, the report urges flexible arrangements - more or less equivalent to those envisaged in economic partnership agreements (EPAs) - to enable these countries to cope with the loss of customs revenue. Corruption In order to promote good governance, transparency and the rule of law, the Parliament wishes to see intervention from Member States and the Commission in cases where their is clear legal evidence that officials from ASEAN countries are involved in corruption cases related to natural resources. The House ask the Commission to report to the Parliament on any action it will undertake in this regard. Banking secrecy A resolution to the problem of banking secrecy in Singapore is "essential if there is to be a real prospect of a region-to-region [free-trade agreement]", argues the report. Lastly, MEPs point out that, since the Lisbon Treaty is due to enter into force before the end of the negotiations, the approval of the European Parliament will be needed once the negotiations are completed. The members of ASEAN are: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 20080505IPR28210 Trade and economic relations with the countries of South East Asia (ASEAN) Text, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 8 May) EN 1 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5565162 EN 2 LINK /activities/plenary/ta/calendar.do?language=EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
