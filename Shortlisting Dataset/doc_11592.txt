the UN Convention against Torture and Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom to make the necessary declaration under Article 22 of the Convention recognising the United Nations Committee Against Torture as being competent to receive and examine individual complaints; treatment of refugees and immigrants 30. Expresses concern about the all-too-common and unacceptable problems relating to the situation of asylum seekers, including the random barring of access to lawful asylum procedures and about the quasi-systematic practice of detaining of asylum seekers in some Member States, often in intolerable conditions, and the brutal treatment inflicted on them during enforced expulsion, in some cases leading to death; 31. Calls for the strict application by Member States of the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol thereto and the principles drawn up by the UNHCR Executive Committee; 32. Calls on Member States to recognise gender persecution; recalls that the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees does not distinguish among victims of persecution, whether perpetrated by State bodies or by anybody else; 33. Regrets that the European Council meeting in Tampere merely decided on a common approach to asylum procedures at European level instead of opting for a single asylum procedure, and therefore awaits the Commission's proposal for a single asylum procedure and a uniform status for all who have been granted asylum within the European Union; 34. Calls on Member States, in developing a common asylum system, to move beyond minimum levels of harmonisation by adopting high protection standards as the basis for future asylum instruments; 35. Emphasises that, in the absence of harmonisation in the short term, any common approach to asylum procedures in the EU should guarantee respect for the following essential principles: - all asylum seekers should have access to the asylum procedure; - they should have a right to a fair hearing and a suspensory appeal, except in cases in which this is clearly unfounded; - before expelling an asylum seeker towards 'a safe third country', Member States should ensure that he or she will be admitted and will not subsequently be expelled; 36. Stresses the need to create a legal basis and provide adequate budgetary resources for the European Fund for Refugees, set up at the initiative of the European Parliament, to ensure that the expense is genuinely shared among the Member States of the European Union; calls on Member States to ensure that funds are used in a balanced manner for reception, integration and return measures, to the benefit of refugees, asylum-seekers and persons benefiting from complementary protection as well as temporary protection; shortcomings of judicial services 37. Is alarmed at the frequent violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Member States in the field of criminal justice, as pointed out by the European Court of Human Rights; urges, therefore, Member States, and in particular Italy, to take all the necessary measures to limit pre-trial detention as far as possible by speeding up investigations and judicial proceedings and ensuring that each citizen can count on justice being delivered as promptly and fairly as possible;
