WRITTEN QUESTION E-3170/08 by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (ALDE) to the Commission (5 June 2008) Subject: Medical passport The use of a medical passport in the Schengen countries was introduced under EU legislation on 25 March 2001. The object of the medical passport was to set up a system that would make it simpler for travellers to document their right to bring with them medicines containing euphoriants. There is, however, no medical passport control at airports, for example. Does the Commission consider that this system is fit for purpose? Can it be regarded as an unnecessary bureaucratic procedure to require a medical passport for kodymagnyl, for example, a non-prescription medicine? Has the Commission considered carrying out an evaluation of the system?
