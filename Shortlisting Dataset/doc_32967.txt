Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (25 October 2007) In recent weeks, in response to the deteriorating situation in Burma/Myanmar, the Commission has worked together with Member States in a series of diplomatic demarches to countries in the region which have direct influence on the regime, including China, India, the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Japan. The Commission has also participated in an EU demarche in Yangon, and has also called in the chargé d’ affaires of Burma/Myanmar in their Mission to the EU, to make direct representations on the situation in that country. The Commission and Member States have been pressing for the Regime to stop the opression, release political prisoners and begin a genuinely inclusive political dialogue. The EU’s policy remains a balanced one with continued delivery of humanitarian assistance and vigorous support of United Nations (UN) efforts. In this latter context, the EU strongly backs the ‘good offices’ of UN Special Envoy, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, who, it is understood, plans a return visit to Burma/Myanmar and to other countries in the region in the coming weeks. Nevertheless, the October 2007 GAERC (General Affairs and External Relations Council) has decided the imposition of further restrictive measures on Burma/Myanmar. Regarding the number of protesters detained, the Commission does not have any more detailed figures than those being now circulated in public reporting. The Commission is particularly concerned, however, that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has not yet been granted access to the detainees in order to provide basic medical care, and it is using appropriate channels to help improve that situation.
