Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2010) Since its establishment in 1997, Daphne has funded more than 500 projects in the field of preventing violence and supporting women, children and young people who are victims of violence. Daphne has also contributed to the creation of important European networks to raise the awareness of citizens about problems related to violence against women. In 2008 and 2009 the Daphne III Programme has provided financial support to non-governmental organisations, local authorities, universities and other bodies working in the area of combatting violence against women, children and young people, through action grants and operating grants. In 2008, 42 action grants — for the co-financing of specific transnational actions — were awarded for a total amount of EUR 11 085 452.40. The charts in Annex a provide an overview of proposals submitted per country and selected projects per country of applicant. In 2008 the Daphne III Programme also supported the existence and functioning of nine organisations — such as non‑profit organisations, voluntary associations, foundations, NGOs or similar bodies — pursuing an aim of general European interest, to enable them to carry out a set of activities over a period equivalent to the organisations' financial year. Operating grants were awarded to such organisations for a total amount of EUR 1 453 212.60. Moreover, in 2009 the Daphne III Programme has selected for co-funding 42 projects out of the 214 submitted, for a total amount of EUR 12 249 244.53. Operating grants were awarded to 12 organisations for a total amount of EUR 1 938 054.51. The charts in Annex a provide an overview of eligible proposals for action grants submitted per country in 2009 and selected proposals per country (applicant organisation and partner organisations). In addition, the Daphne III Programme has launched a study on harmful traditional practices inside the EU (including female genital mutilation, forced/early marriage or for forced sexual relationships and honour-related crimes). The results of the study were presented at the end of 2009. The Programme has also co-financed a conference on men's violence against women, organised by the Swedish EU Presidency in November 2009 and has launched a Eurobarometer survey on EU citizen's perception of violence against women and children. Furthermore, the second series of ‘good practice’ thematic booklets designed to synthesise and share the outcomes and lessons of Daphne-funded projects in some areas of violence with a wider audience was published and distributed. A commemorative brochure was also published and distributed in 2009 documenting ‘success stories’ out of the 505 projects supported by Daphne during its first 10 years. This publication introduces a selection of projects that illustrate the impressive results of the Daphne Programme overall.
