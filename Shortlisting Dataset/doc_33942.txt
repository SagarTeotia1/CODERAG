Question for written answer E-8013/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Ioannis A. Tsoukalas (PPE) (6 October 2010) Subject: Checks on implementation of the 7th framework programme In connection with recent efforts by the EU institutions to simplify the framework programmes (FP) — and given that we are in the middle of implementing the 7th FP — much debate is centred on the Commission's excessive focus on checks and zero tolerance of risks and errors. To achieve more effective application of the framework programmes, many stakeholders suggest a clearer definition of the term ‘error’ and a ‘single check approach’ carried out in real time by a single body, which will help the inspectors to avoid numerous errors. In the light also of the recent announcement that the director of a UK company was sentenced to 18 months in prison for embezzling 174 500 euro of funding for a project under the 5th research framework programme, will the Commission answer the following questions? — Which body is responsible for carrying out checks under the 7th FP? In what way is the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) involved in the procedure for checking applications for European funding? — What information does the Commission have concerning the checks and their findings? In particular, how many random administrative and financial checks have been carried out to date and what percentage of FP projects/funding contracts do they cover? How many errors/irregularities have been identified? What amounts were involved, in respect of which projects and in which countries was the largest number of errors/irregularities detected? Which checks have resulted in charges and convictions? What amounts from the research FP have been paid back? — To what is the large number of administrative and financial errors attributable and what immediate corrective measures are being taken under the 7th FP to remedy the problem?
