WRITTEN QUESTION E-0917/06 by Henrik Lax (ALDE) to the Commission (7 March 2006) Subject: Large trucks Under an agreement reached in 1996 between Finland and the EU, Finland is required to comply with the EU directive on truck sizes by 2007. At the end of the year, when the EU directive limiting the maximum permitted width to 2.55 metres for trucks more than 22 metres long enters into force, thousands of Finnish trucks will become illegal. The width of these vehicles will then have to be reduced by 5 cm in comparison with the previous Finnish standard, a measure which will be expensive and unnecessary for trucks which are still perfectly suitable for use. In Finland there are currently 3000 truck/trailer combinations which are too long and approximately 1500 trailers which are too wide. The cost merely of converting all these trucks to comply with the EU standard, i.e. removing 5 cm from the width of vehicles which comply with the previous Finnish standard, will amount to nearly EUR 70 million for the industry as a whole and EUR 15000 per vehicle. Will the Commission extend the transitional period for Finnish trucks so that usable trucks can be driven until the end of their lives, thus avoiding the necessity for a whole industry to incur unnecessary extra costs?
