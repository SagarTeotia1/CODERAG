Question for Question Time H-0601/2010 to the Commission Part-session: December 2010 Rule 116 Zigmantas Balčytis (S&D) Subject: Monitoring the assessment and implementation of national energy efficiency action plans The Commission communication entitled ‘Energy 2020: A strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy’ stresses that the EU’s energy independence indeed largely depends on internal energy infrastructure, but also depends on the way in which Member States succeed in ensuring energy efficiency, particularly in buildings and transport. In the communication, the Commission expresses dissatisfaction with the national energy efficiency action plans submitted by Member States, because progress in these fields is too slow. Does not the Commission consider that it ought to play a greater role and improve coordination with the Member States in drafting national action plans, as well as to monitor their implementation more, in order to ensure that the European Union can abide by the commitments it has accepted for the period to 2020?
