Reply (19 September 2007) The Council would draw the attention of the Honourable Member to Council Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 of 8 February 1993 on checks for conformity with the rules on product safety in the case of products imported from third countries OJ L 40, 17.2.1993, p. 1. . The regulation states that products may not be placed on the Community market unless they conform to the rules applicable and that Member States are responsible for carrying out checks on their conformity. It is the joint responsibility of the customs authorities and of the national market surveillance authorities to carry out these checks, which may lead to the suspension of the release of a product or a ban on its being placed on the market See Articles 2 and 6. . As the Honourable Member will certainly be aware, in February 2007 the Commission adopted a proposal, on the basis of Articles 95 and 133 TEC, for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products 2007/0029(COD). . The proposal aims, inter alia , at repealing Regulation (EC) No 339/93 and integrating its provisions into the proposed regulation, and provides for the control of products from third countries. At its meeting on 21 and 22 May the Council, in public debate, took note of a Presidency progress report on the draft regulation. The Council is continuing its discussions on the draft. As regards the placement on the market of medicinal products, Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67. of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use states that: ‘No medicinal product may be placed on the market of a Member State unless a marketing authorisation has been issued by the competent authorities of that Member State in accordance with this directive or unless an authorisation has been granted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, read in conjunction with Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use.’
