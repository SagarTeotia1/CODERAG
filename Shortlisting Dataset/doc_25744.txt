aid to SMEs; proposes that the increase be adjusted upwards through the setting of a single 20% figure for both small and medium-sized businesses, so as not to discourage the growth of small enterprises; 24. Believes that the Horizontal Aid Guidelines too must take due account of territorial differences, in order not to jeopardise cohesion objectives - for which reason such aid should be kept in its current proportion; 25. Urges, therefore, the Commission to raise the ceiling of State aid intensity further to include a regional component for the benefit of poorer regions, in cases of State aid granted on the basis of the new Horizontal Aid Guidelines; such an aid bonus for horizontal aid should be differentiated according to the categorisation of regional aid intensity outlined in paragraphs 41 to 46 of the draft Regional Aid Guidelines; 26. Supports the definition of initial investment suggested by the Commission and, in particular, the differentiation of eligible expenses between SMEs and large companies as outlined in paragraphs 31 et seq . of the draft Regional Aid Guidelines, but hopes for greater flexibility allowing for specific situations, where this is justified; calls on the Commission, however, to clarify whether, on the basis of the draft Regional Aid Guidelines, the provision of services will be eligible for aid, as well as the supply of products; furthermore considers that, when defining initial investment, the current requirement that the investment should lead to fundamental changes in terms of the rationalisation, diversification or modernisation of the product or production process should continue to be used, since it seems less restrictive than the requirement to bring a completely new product onto the market; 27. Proposes that, in the light of current practice, the Commission allow Member States that have not adopted the single currency to be able to apply the exchange rate "on the date when the application for aid is received" for projects forming part of adopted programmes, because the specific level of aid already needs to be known at the time when the project is assessed, not only on the day when the decision is made; 28. Calls on the Commission to specify more precisely what constitutes eligible expenditure in order to allow categories thereof to be set more accurately and in order that decision-making on the eligibility of expenditure may be left to the Member States; 29. Welcomes the Commission's acknowledgement that the form of regional aid can be variable and asks the Commission to carry out a study assessing which type of State aid seems to be most beneficial for regional development and to entail a lesser risk of distorting competition; 30. Welcomes the Commission's intention to require that eligible intangible assets must remain within the eligible region, which will be ensured by a number of conditions laid out in paragraph 53 of the draft Regional Aid Guidelines; requests clarification, however, as to whether the transfer of an undertaking from one eligible region to another also represents a breach of the condition allowing aid intended to finance a particular investment or whether it is
