WRITTEN QUESTION E-0388/09 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (30 January 2009) Subject: Information on the use of funds from the Consumer Policy programme by the municipality of Pesaro The European Union’s financial framework for 2007‑2013 includes many programmes aimed at supporting Community policies in a range of fields, such as research and technological development, training programmes, the promotion of culture, the environment, transport, energy and health and consumer protection. Specifically, the municipality of Pesaro (Marche) appears to be particularly in need of European funding in order to promote and develop new measures to protect citizens/consumers. In the light of the above, can the Commission indicate: 1. whether the municipality of Pesaro has submitted any projects under the Consumer Policy programme? 2. whether that municipality obtained funding and, if not, on what grounds it was refused? 3. if funds were obtained, whether they were used within the stipulated period and, if not, whether the Commission has asked for the sums granted to be repaid?
