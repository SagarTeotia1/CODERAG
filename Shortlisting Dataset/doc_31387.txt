Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (8 July 2010) The Commission considers flexibility as a very important part of the implementation of hygiene Regulations. This is highlighted also in the Commission report on the experience gained during the implementation of the hygiene Regulations, adopted on 28 July 2009. Moreover, it is recognised that in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States are best placed to find appropriate solutions based on local situations and on appropriate levels of hygiene in these businesses, without compromising the objective of food safety. The flexibility provisions of the Hygiene Regulations provide many different tools to the Member States in order to resolve problems similar to the one you have pointed out in your question (e.g. small capacity slaughterhouses and cutting plants). At this regard, the Commission prepared a guidance document that will be available for the Competent Authorities and food business operators at the end of July in all EU languages. The Commission shares the point of view of the Honourable Member on the possibility to separate operations in time in slaughterhouses as the so called ‘agriturismi’ as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, OJ L 226, 25.6.2004. . Competent authorities must be satisfied with the measures taken in order to comply with the objective of food safety foreseen in the EU legislation.
