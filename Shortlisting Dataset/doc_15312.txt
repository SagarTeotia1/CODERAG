Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (23 March 2010) In response to the question of the Honourable Member on the implementation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between Morocco and the EU, the Commission would like to provide the following information regarding its implementation. The programming of measures foreseen in the framework of this FPA covers the entire territory covered by the agreement, including the coastal area of Western Sahara. Several programmed measures concern Western Sahara, notably in the area of support to professional training. For example, some of the programmed activities support the centre for the development of professional skills in the area of fisheries in Dakhla as well as the technical institute for maritime fisheries in Layyoune. In the negotiations of the FPA, full account was taken of the livelihood of the people of Western Sahara, notably by giving due regard to the importance of the fisheries sector for the local population. This is why certain key stocks (e.g. octopus and shrimps) have been excluded from the fishing possibilities identified in the FPA, with the intention of reserving them for local operators.
