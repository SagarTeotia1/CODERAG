ORAL QUESTION H-0417/03 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Didier Rod to the Council Subject: Preparations for the aid donors' meeting on Colombia to be held in London on 10 July 2003 On a number of occasions the European Union has said that political negotiation is the only viable solution to the armed conflict in Colombia. Broad sections of Colombian society see a humanitarian agreement as the first step towards guaranteeing greater protection for the civilian population. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) stated in April 2002 that the international community should reject any move to involve the civilian population of Colombia in the conflict or any other expression of support for violence. The new government, in proposing the creation of the ‘democratic security policy’, is trying to involve the civilian population in the internal armed conflict by means of networks of informants, peasant soldiers and civilian guards. What steps is the Council taking to bring about the adoption of a humanitarian agreement between the two sides which would ensure a distinction is made between the civilian population and soldiers? What steps will it take to remind the Colombian Government of its obligation to respect the civilian population’s right not to take part in the conflict?
