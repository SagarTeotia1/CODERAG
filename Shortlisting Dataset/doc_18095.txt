WRITTEN QUESTION E-2659/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (8 May 2008) Subject: Breaches in data protection security Despite the past blunders of loss of personal data of millions of people in the UK, current reports state that a large number of breaches in data protection security are still occurring in Britain. Could the Commission enquire with the British authorities as to why this unacceptable situation continues to exist and what further corrective measures the British Government is going to take?
