WRITTEN QUESTION E-3485/06 by Philip Claeys (NI) to the Commission (26 July 2006) Subject: Comments by a Commission official in Turkey Mr Hansjörg Kretschmer, the head of the European Commission Representation in Turkey, stated during a press conference on 12 July that the opening up of Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot vessels and aircraft did not necessarily have to signify recognition of the Republic of Cyprus (see, for example, www.turkishpress.com). This created the impression that recognition of all 25 Member States of the European Union is not a real necessity, in contrast to implementation of the provisions of the Ankara Protocol. Does this reflect the Commission's position, or it is purely Mr Kretschmer's personal view? Is it usual for European Union officials to make — in this instance highly controversial — political statements?
