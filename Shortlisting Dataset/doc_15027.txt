the competent authorities of Member States for vehicles designed as conference buses and produced in small series or as individual vehicles should be automatically recognised in the other Member States as far as the use, sale and registration of those vehicles is concerned. Justification Exemptions granted on a national basis which can, but do not have to be accepted by other national authorities can create a distortion of the market for the producers of the vehicles concerned, create much red tape for national administration and cause uncertainty for the users of these vehicles. Automatic recognition of these exemptions would not only eliminate these inconveniences but also provide an incentive for national authorities to proceed very carefully when granting exemptions. 3Amendment 2 ARTICLE 10 A, POINT 1 A (new) Article 8 a (new) (Directive 77/54/EEC) 1a) The following Article shall be inserted "Article 8a The Commission and the Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that exemptions for vehicles of category M 3 designed as conference buses granted by the competent authority of a Member State pursuant to Article 8(2)(a) of Directive 70/156/EEC are recognised by the competent authorities of the other Member States as far as the use, sale and registration of those vehicles is concerned.". Justification Exemptions granted on a national basis which can, but do not have to be accepted by other national authorities can create a distortion of the market for the producers of the vehicles concerned, create much red tape for national administration and cause uncertainty for the users of these vehicles.
