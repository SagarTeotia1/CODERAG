WRITTEN QUESTION E-3265/06 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (14 July 2006) Subject: Biological treatment plant at the sources of the River Farsalitis In 1977, the company Thessaliki Viomichania Trofimon A.B.E.E. acquired ownership of an area of land incorporating a section of the sources of the River Farsalitis. Since 2004, the district of Vrysia in the municipality of Farsala has laid claim to that area with a view to constructing a lake on the site, in order to protect the sources of the river and the surrounding wetland, and increasing the underground waters in the region, as the sources of the Farsalitis are also used to supply water to the district of Vrysia. The abovementioned company obtained permits at various times to build a biological treatment plant at the site in question but these were revoked by the prefecture following protests by local residents. Article 7, paragraph 3 of Directive 2000/60/EC OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 1 . establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy stipulates that Member States shall ensure the necessary protection for bodies of water used to supply water for human consumption with the aim of avoiding deterioration in their quality and that Member States may establish safeguard zones for those bodies of water. In the light of the above, will the Commission say whether it is aware of the situation at the sources of the River Farsalitis? What measures will it take to compel the Member State to comply with the legislation in force and protect the River Farsalitis and the wetland in that area?
