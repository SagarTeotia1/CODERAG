Reply (26 January 2011) It is not for the Council to comment on a judgment by the Court of Justice. As to whether there is a need to amend Directive 2004/83/EC (the ‘Qualification Directive’) Council Directive 2004/83/EC on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third‑country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (OJ L 304, 30.9.2004, p. 12). , the Council would remind the Honourable Member that the Commission proposed a recast of the text in October 2009 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third‑country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection and the content of the protection granted (Recast) (COM(2009)551 final/2). . That text is currently under consideration in the Council. It will, if appropriate, be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.
