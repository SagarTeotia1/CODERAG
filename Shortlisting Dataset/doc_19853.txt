Answer given by Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2011) The European Commission initially allocated a first envelope of EUR 12 million to finance humanitarian support through partners (NGOs, UN and the Red Cross) that are already present and active in the affected regions. Considering the worrying evolution of the epidemic, a further emergency decision of EUR 10 million was adopted on 17 December 2010. This EUR 22 million is funding humanitarian activities aimed at saving lives and treating sick people, improving access to safe water and providing adequate sanitation as a measure of prevention and promoting best practices in hygiene in order to change often inadequate behaviour. The European Mechanism for Civil Protection has also been activated through the Monitoring and Information Center (MIC) of the European Commission, calling on Member States to assist through the donation of in-kind goods such as chlorine, hospital beds, medicines and other useful items. However, it is important to bear in mind that the main issue regarding cholera is not the availability of funds but the fast deployment of qualified staff, who are not always readily available. With regard to stabilising the political situation following the elections of 28 November 2010 and the announcement of their preliminary results on 7 December 2010, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President called upon all political actors in Haiti to uphold the Constitution of Haiti and abide by the rules and procedures of the electoral process and to play a constructive role during the period of electoral unrest. The Commission stands ready to further assist Haiti in this task.
