WRITTEN QUESTION E-3977/07 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (1 August 2007) Subject: Job losses as a result of the postal service liberalisation Postal workers across Scotland took part in a day of strike action recently to protest against Royal Mail plans that could potentially result in up to 40 000 job cuts. Competition as a result of the EU‑wide liberalisation of the postal market is being blamed in some quarters for the potential job losses. While there have been gradual losses over the years as the postal service industry has been affected by consumers converting to other forms of communication and as new technology, such as automated sorting machines, has come to the fore, it is thought by many employees and by trade unions that the opening up of the market has encouraged some companies to lay off employees, switch many staff from full-time to part-time work, and lower wages. At a Postal Services Seminar for Journalists on 2 July, the Head of the Commission Postal Services Unit argued that there has been no net loss in the industry because of the jobs produced by new postal service operators and by the creation of niche markets. Can the Commission state whether such a view is based on any study undertaken by the Commission into the overall effect on employment of full market opening in the postal sector? If so what were the findings in full? If such a study does not exist, does the Commission intend to instigate an analysis of employment in the postal industry?
