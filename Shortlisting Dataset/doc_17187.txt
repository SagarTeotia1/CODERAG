Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (13 September 2011) Within the EU Framework for national Roma integration strategies adopted on 5 April 2011 and validated by the European Council on 23-24 June 2011, each Member State is expected to review or prepare and implement national integration strategies or sets of public policies for the economic and social integration of Roma. The Commission will assess the national Roma integration strategies submitted by Member States including Hungary by the end of 2011 and will make adequate recommendations in a report to the Parliament and to the Council in April 2012. When doing so, the Commission will pay particular attention to the effectiveness of such public policies in promoting the economic and social integration of Roma.
