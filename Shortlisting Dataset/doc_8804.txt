Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (8 May 2008) With regard to allegations of possible corruption concerning the German Siemens Group, the Commission has nothing to add to its reply to Written Question E‑0589/08 by Mr Georgiou. Concerning allegations of possible corruption in a concrete case inside one Member State, it is first the responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member State concerned to take appropriate action. With the exception of cases concerning the protection of the EU financial interests, the Commission is not involved in ongoing investigations concerning such cases. Therefore, it cannot report about the possible implication of several Member States in this case, nor indicate in which countries investigations have been launched. As stated in its reply to Written Question E‑0505/08 by Ms Gräßle, the Commission recalls that the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is competent for investigating cases of fraud and irregularities where the EU budget is affected. To that end, OLAF acts in close cooperation with the relevant national authorities. The Commission is informed that the Director-General of OLAF has had contacts with the Public Prosecution Office in Munich relating to the matter to which the Honourable Member refers. So far, there are no indications of involvement of EU funds in the investigation undertaken by the Prosecution Office. Nothing suggests either that Community competition law has been breached.
