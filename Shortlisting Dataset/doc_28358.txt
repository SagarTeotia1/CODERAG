WRITTEN QUESTION E-0183/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (29 January 2009) Subject: Dispute involving Italian State Railways, Deutsche Bahn (DB), and the SNCF For the past few weeks there have been reports in several national and international dailies that Italian State Railways (FS) and German Rail (DB) have been expressing disquiet about the excessively protectionist attitude of the SNCF, the French railway company. FS and DB maintain that the French company has failed to comply in the proper manner with Directive 2004/51/EC, whereby the rail freight market was to be liberalised from 1 January 2006. The SNCF has allegedly prevented the German and Italian railway companies, de facto, from entering the French domestic market, adversely affecting consumers, who are not free to choose their carrier. The whole situation is especially surprising because the SNCF is due to enter the Italian high-speed train market in 2011; it holds a 20 % stake in a passenger carrier, NTV (Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori). In some countries, then, for example Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany, the conditions for competition are fully satisfied. The fact that this is not the case elsewhere constitutes a manifest violation of competition law and the principle of reciprocity. Does not the Commission believe, therefore, that it should conduct an investigation in order to determine the extent of the substantial French rail freight market with a view to ascertaining whether, and if so how, the SNCF is impeding competition?
