party, particularly in the case of undercutting; (c) incorporation into national law of all the principles, criteria and operative provisions of the Code of Conduct, on the understanding that this does not affect the right of Member States to operate more restrictive national policies; (d) all future EU embargoes to refer to those categories of equipment on the Common Military List or in the Annexes to the Dual-Use Regulation to which an embargo is to apply; 27. Calls, with regard to the establishment of a common European armaments market, for controls on the movement of armaments within the European Union to be removed step by step, in the context of a common EU arms export control policy through, for example, the agreement on a no-undercutting rule under the EU Code of Conduct; 28. Strongly supports the proposal for a Council Trade Regulation imposing an export ban on all equipment for the death penalty, for torture or any other degrading or inhuman treatment, prohibiting specific arms such as anti-personnel mines and laying down strict controls for equipment that might be used for internal repression; 29.
