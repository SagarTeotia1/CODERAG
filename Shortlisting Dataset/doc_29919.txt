the implementation of this Chapter and the parties can seek their advice. The Trade and Sustainable Development Committee can also seek the advice of relevant international organisations, such as the International Labour Organisation or Multilateral Environment Agreements. The members of the Domestic Advisory Group(s) from both EU and Korea will meet at a Civil Society Forum. The views, findings and opinions of the Civil Society Forum can be submitted to the parties directly or through the Advisory Groups. The Commission intends to consult all relevant stakeholders to determine the best modalities to set up the Civil Society Forum so as to ensure an effective enforcement of the commitments reflected in the Trade and Sustainable Development Chapter. The EU‑Korea Agreement sets an important precedent for building sustainable development provisions, including substantive commitments on environment and labour, into EU trade agreements.
