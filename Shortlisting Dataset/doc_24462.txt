Question for written answer E-002165/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Philippe Juvin (PPE) (3 March 2011) Subject: Clinical trials: is red tape hampering European clinical research? Clinical trials in the EU have a significant bearing on public health in Europe and the vitality of research. They enable the effects of a particular treatment to be evaluated, for example, and taking part in them allows patients to undergo innovative treatments. Although the Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) has helped to improve clinical best practices in the EU, the sheer number of national approval procedures for clinical trials has actually led to an increase in red tape. This red tape has become a hindrance to clinical research in the EU. Frontier clinical research could even ultimately move away from Europe, thereby limiting patients' access to innovative treatment and damaging Europe's standing in the field of research. In its communication of 7 December 2010, the Commission indicated its willingness to reduce the administrative burden in order to facilitate clinical research. Within the context of the revision of Directive 2001/20/EC, what are the Commission's guidelines for reducing the administrative burden effectively? With a view to simplifying the existing procedures, does the Commission believe that it is possible to standardise the regulatory requirements across all the Member States? With regard to international multi-centre clinical trials, does the Commission think it would be possible to introduce a centralised European authorisation procedure, bearing in mind the existing national requirements? Such a procedure would enable clinical trials to be carried out on a European scale on the basis of mutual recognition. Finally, given that its Europe 2020 Strategy makes the development of an innovation- and knowledge-based economy a key objective, when is the Commission planning to put forward a legislative proposal? Is there already a firm timetable? If not, why not?
