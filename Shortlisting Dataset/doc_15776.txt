the discharge procedure with a view to providing all the information needed as regards the execution of the Council budget; 4. Reiterates that the expenditure of the Council ought to be scrutinised in the same way as that of the other Union institutions, and suggests that the most appropriate approach would be as indicated in its resolution of 16 June 2010, in particular, that ''such scrutiny is based on the following written documents submitted by all institutions: – accounts of the preceding financial year relating to the implementation of the budget, – a financial statement of the assets and liabilities, – annual activity report on their budget and financial management, – annual report of the internal auditor, as well as an oral presentation given in the meeting of the Committee responsible for the discharge procedure"; 5. Strongly believes that it is necessary to set up a reliable, long-term system of cooperation between Parliament and the Council on the discharge procedure on a mutually acceptable basis; repeats its position to replace the 'gentlemen's agreement' with a formal agreement that takes account of the Union's principle of taking decisions "as openly as possible" (Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union); 6. Deeply regrets both that the Council Presidency declined the invitations to attend the meeting of the Committee responsible for the discharge procedure, where it was planned to discuss the Council Presidency's standing on the proposed procedure and the possible modalities of cooperation as regards the discharge, and also that the Secretary-General of the Council declined to attend the meeting of the Committee responsible for the discharge procedure and to exchange views on the Council discharge procedure; 7. Notes the proposal on the organisation of relations between Parliament and the Council regarding their respective budgets, as annexed to the letter of Secretary-General of the Council of 30 September 2010; disagrees with the standpoints of that proposal, and reiterates that a distinction must be maintained with regard to the different roles of Parliament and the Council in the discharge procedure and in the budgetary procedure, since these are two separate procedures and at no time and under no circumstances can the Council be anything other than fully accountable to the public for the funds entrusted to it; deeply regrets that the Council Presidency and the General Secretariat of the Council declined to attend the meeting of the Committee responsible for the discharge procedure to provide information and answers to questions on the Council discharge for the financial year 2009, and that they also declined to provide written replies to the questionnaire as submitted by the rapporteur; 8. Notes the goodwill of the Hungarian Presidency and the progress achieved; proposes, in order to facilitate the exchange of information in the discharge procedure, to follow the same approach as the rest of the other institutions, the fundamental elements of which should be: – that a formal meeting be held between representatives of the Council and Parliament's Committee responsible for the discharge procedure, to be attended by the Secretary-General of the Council and the Presidency in office,
