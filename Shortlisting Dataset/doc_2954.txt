Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2010) The Commission is fully aware of the importance of biodiversity protection with a view to ensure proper functioning and sustainable use of ecosystems and shares the Honourable Member's concern about the risks and damage caused by the loss of biodiversity. To this end, several actions have been undertaken either directly through the EU environmental policy Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive). OJ L 164, of 25.6.2008. Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (5) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Habitats Directive’), OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7. Directive as last amended by Directive 2006/105/EC (OJ L 363, of 20.12.2006, p. 368). or by integrating environmental concerns into sectoral policies including the common fisheries policy. Such concerns were the basis of the reflections launched by the Commission in 2003, which lead to the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 of 21 December 2006, concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea. This regulation aims to tackle the problems of Mediterranean fisheries in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, by integrating the environmental dimension, as required by the Treaties, by prohibiting the use of destructive fishing practices, by protecting coastal areas and relevant habitats, such as Posidonia beds, mäerl and coralligenous from the effects of more active fishing gears and by promoting the strengthening of the network of marine protected areas. Moreover, fishing activities with trawl nets and dredges are prohibited at depths greater than 1 000 metres. The Commission is convinced that this instrument, if properly implemented by Member States, will contribute to deliver sustainable fisheries while mitigating the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems. In this sense, the recently adopted improved control framework will help to increase the level of compliance to the Mediterranean Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. (OJ L 343 of 22.12.2009). . In addition, considering the importance of the international dimension in the Mediterranean, the Commission will continue to work through the existing Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, notably the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM, also covering the Black Sea) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, covering also the Mediterranean area) as well as within the framework of the Barcelona Convention to ensure sustainable exploitation in a healthy environment.
