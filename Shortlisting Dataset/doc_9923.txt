Reply (15 September 2008) As the Honourable Member knows, the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) was launched in November 2001. Since its inception, the Council has been following the negotiation process closely, both in the relevant Council preparatory body and at ambassadorial and ministerial level. The main instrument for this ongoing scrutiny is the article 133 Committee. At its weekly meetings the first item on the agenda is always, and has been for six and a half years now, the DDA. As for the Council, it has held numerous debates on the matter, often adopting conclusions. These conclusions form the mandate for the Commission. At its discussion on 10 March 2008, the Council scrutinised the revised negotiating texts and put in place all instruments needed to ensure that proper monitoring can continue in the near future and that it will be fruitful. The Council reverted to this issue in its May meeting and will do so again in an extraordinary meeting scheduled for 18 July 2008 and in Geneva during the week starting on 21 July 2008.
