that there are safeguards within the TRIPS Agreement to address the imbalance between the protection of patents - essential for continued research and development of new products including vaccines - and the right of everyone to access affordable treatment; acknowledges that compulsory licensing is already provided for under TRIPS in cases of health emergency and calls on the Commission and the TRIPS Council to clarify where Article 31 of TRIPS may be used and to provide a transparent assessment of the impact the agreement has on access to essential medicines; notes also that most developing countries are experiencing huge difficulties in interpreting and making use of the safeguards; 40. Recognises the role of patents in the development of essential drugs, and supports the Commission in its view that there does not necessarily have to be a contradiction between the protection of intellectual property rights and accessible health care in developing countries; emphasises, however, that unfortunately this may be the case in practice; 41. Insists on the instrument of compulsory licensing but requests the Commission to prepare and then submit to the European Parliament and the Council, a well-argued proposal for a mandate to be granted to the Commission which intends to examine and propose ways and means seeking to review the relevant articles of the TRIPS Agreement in order to: (a) reduce the patent protection granted for 20 years and laid down in the TRIPS Agreement in a number of patented medicines only in the field of communicable diseases; (b) specify the conditions under which the practice of "ever-greening" - i.e. process of introducing "minor changes" to a patented drug upon expiry - would be eligible; 42. Welcomes the positions recently adopted by all players in this field on a pro-public health interpretation of the TRIPS Agreement and emphasises the need to encourage a more equitable sharing of the benefits of technological development in terms of health between people in developed countries and people in developing countries and to support the Commissioner responsible for such issues in efforts to launch a debate in the WTO on reconciling TRIPS with objectives regarding health protection in developing countries; 43. Calls for the establishment of a technical and legal assistance mechanism within the WTO in order to promote implementation of the TRIPS Agreement which takes account of the specific public health interests of the developing countries, and to prevent the adoption of restrictive legislation in this field; 44. Considers that the setting-up of a WTO working group on access to medicines, with WHO and UNAIDS participation, must make it possible to respond to this concern; 45. Reiterates that the TRIPS Agreement allows local manufacture of generic equivalents of patented medicines in cases of national emergencies or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use without authorisation of the right holder through compulsory licensing; reiterates also that developing countries should be encouraged to seek EC technical assistance to collaborate with appropriate manufacturers to realise cheaper and wider access to medication and treatment for those in need; 46. Recognises that the basic laws
