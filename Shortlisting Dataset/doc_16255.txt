smooth implementation of the Lisbon Treaty will ensure a European Union fit to tackle the challenges of the future. I hope and expect that we will see the finishing touches to the most ambitious system in the world to tackle climate change and promote energy security. And it is particularly important that we do it in the first half of 2009 at the latest, so that the European Union can be ready to make a decisive contribution to the global negotiations at the Copenhagen Conference at the end of that year."

The committee is critical of what it sees as the Commission's hitherto “tacit acceptance of Member States’ collective irresponsibility” (with
