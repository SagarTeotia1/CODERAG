Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (10 December 2010) The SAP-PS IT tool was introduced in order to meet the need for an integrated project management system which would serve as a tool for the management of additional income through administrative arrangement for third party work in order to meet with high accountability standards. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) decided to opt for the SAP Project System and SAP Cross Application Time Sheet system. Unfortunately, the system did not live up to expectations, proving insufficiently tailored to the complicated needs of specialised users; its use was discontinued in September 2009 after a detailed internal JRC audit on the performance and introduction of the system was carried out. At no stage has any evidence of mismanagement or fraud arisen. This project has a long and complex history, and in order to fully address each of the fourteen sub-questions posed, it is proposed that the JRC will send a detailed and comprehensive reply to the Honourable Member. A follow-up meeting can be arranged if anything remains unclear.
