WRITTEN QUESTION P-0540/08 by Lissy Gröner (PSE) to the Commission (5 February 2008) Subject: Delay in publishing the call for Daphne III On 20 June 2007, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Decision No 779/2007/EC establishing, for the period 2007‑13, a specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk (Daphne III programme) as part of the General Programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’. The decision was published in the Official Journal L 173 of 3 July 2007. More than six months after the adoption of this decision, the first call for proposals has still not been published. This situation is unfortunate as it delays the possibilities for the Daphne programme to support and fund many projects in the field of violence against women, children and young people. Could the Commission explain why the programme is so delayed and how the Commission will make sure that NGOs can continue or start their work as soon as possible?
