Question for written answer E-4290/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Marek Henryk Migalski (ECR) (16 June 2010) Subject: Progress in the investigation into the murder of Anna Politkovskaya The Russian authorities have still not completed their investigation into the murder of the high-profile investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was shot by unknown assailants on 7 October 2006. Proceedings in this case have been put back on many occasions, and the suspects who were charged during the investigation were subsequently declared innocent and released in September 2009. At the beginning of March 2010 the decision was taken to extend the investigation to 26 May 2010. In that regard, could the Commission indicate what information it has on the results of the investigation and whether the subject was raised during talks at the EU‑Russia summit in Rostov‑on‑Don?
