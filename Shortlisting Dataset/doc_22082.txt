in the Environment Committee. The directive aims to reduce the sulphur content in marine fuels to 1.5% by 2007 (2 years after the entry into force of the directive). It will apply to all vessels in the Baltic, the North Sea, and the English Channel, and for passenger ships in all EU waters. The figure must be reduced to 0.5 % in portal zones where ships will be required to switch off all engines and use shore-side electricity while at berth in ports. Parliament's Environment Committee had hoped to fix a second phase for new limits to come in 2010. 2010 was the date that the committee had hoped to force the Commission to formulate new proposals on the actual limits. However, following negotiations with the Council, a simple revision clause was introduced. The compromise text states that the Commission should draw up a report by 2008, and that, in the light of progress made, and following a cost-benefit analysis, it "will closely examine the proposals to reduce, if possible, the limits to 0.5%" in zones under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). A new limit value, less than 0.5%, could then be considered. The Commissioner for the Environment, Stavros DIMAS , noted that if the Union was not in a position today to fix the limit at 0.5% for post-2008, the Commission "will commit itself to do so in the near future". Jonas SJÖSTEDT (GUE/NGL, SE) remarked that what mattered was a " good result" , recalling that the 0.5% objective had been considered and then discarded at first reading by the EPP-ED. Aldis KU ŠĶ IS (LV) on behalf of the EPP-ED, was very reserved, emphasising the risk of not making use of new and necessary motor fuels, seeing the costs of maritime transport increase to the benefit of other modes of transport, and exposing European maritime transporters to severe competition. Given the global nature of maritime shipping, every effort should be made to find international solutions. Both the Commission and the Member States should endeavour to secure within the IMO a worldwide reduction in the maximum authorised sulphur content of marine fuels. The European directive adds to and completes the IMO's MARPOL convention, which pursues related objectives and will enter into force next month. The directive itself will enter into force in a few months (20 days after its publication in the Official Journal) and will have to be transposed into national law one year later.
