WRITTEN QUESTION E-1341/09 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (2 March 2009) Subject: Whooping cough vaccination During the winter months an increasing number of cases of whooping cough have been reported in the Flanders region. Although this disease had been practically eradicated in Flanders, the number of cases reported in the last 10 years has grown from 14 to 209. Existing vaccination programmes for newborn babies are now again being supplemented in Flanders by compulsory vaccination at school for 14-to-15-year-olds. This proliferation of whooping cough cases in Belgium is apparently linked to the fact that a large number of Dutch children, while attending Belgian schools, are covered by a different vaccination scheme. Under the seventh framework programme (Cooperation) the Commission supports ‘Childinnovac’, which seeks to carry out research into an intranasal vaccine for whooping cough. What is the Commission’s assessment of the progress made by ‘Childinnovac’? What cross-border measures is the Commission considering to combat this dangerous infectious disease?
