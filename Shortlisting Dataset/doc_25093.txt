Question for written answer E-003400/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Catherine Stihler (S&D) (7 April 2011) Subject: Delivering broadband Can the Commission update Parliament on how much EU money has gone into helping Member States deliver broadband access to schools? If EU money has been used in such projects why is it that the broader community cannot access this resource in school hours, in particular in peripheral communities where access is being denied due to the interpretation by certain local authorities of tendering rules? Does this not run counter to the EU's objective of allowing all EU citizens to have access to broadband?
