Question for written answer E-5102/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Morten Messerschmidt (EFD) (20 July 2010) Subject: Ban on marketing snuff tobacco products Will the Commission explain the scientific basis for retaining the ban on the marketing of smoke-free snuff products in all EU Member States except Denmark and Sweden? In particular, how is this ban justified given that tobacco products whose use involves the inhalation of smoke are permitted in spite of being very harmful to health?
