WRITTEN QUESTION P-3084/10 by Corien Wortmann-Kool (PPE) to the Commission (27 April 2010) Subject: Regulation 261/2004 and assistance to air passengers in view of the exceptional circumstances involving the suspension of air traffic resulting from the volcanic ash cloud Regulation 261/2004 OJ L 46, 17.2.2004, p. 1. has been in force since 17 February 2005. The regulation requires airlines to provide assistance to passengers in the event of long delays in flights. Last week there was a highly exceptional situation caused by the closure of European airspace as a result of the volcanic ash cloud. Airlines were required to provide stranded passengers with meals and suitable accommodation. The boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has indicated that stranded passengers must not expect any other compensation than the possible reimbursement of their ticket. This is contrary to the European legislation in force on passenger rights. 1. Is the Commission aware of the comments by O'Leary, the boss of the airline Ryanair? 2. Does the Commission consider that these are contrary to Regulation 261/2004 on passenger rights? 3. Does the Commission agree that this leads to inequality between airlines? Is it prepared to examine the application of the regulation during this crisis, and what measures will it take against disparities in implementation of the regulation? 4. Is the Commission prepared to take account of the costs incurred by airlines as a result of the suspension of air traffic in the economic impact assessment which the Commission has announced in response to this crisis in aviation? 5. Partly in view of the far‑reaching consequences and the fact that airlines could not do anything about this exceptional situation, is the Commission prepared to consider forms of compensation for costs on the basis of the impact assessment? 6. Is the Commission prepared to consider adapting the regulation?
