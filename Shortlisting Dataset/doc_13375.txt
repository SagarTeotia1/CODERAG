WRITTEN QUESTION E-1147/10 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Council (4 March 2010) Subject: Possible application of Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union Article 122 (formerly Article 100 TEC), paragraph 2, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that: ‘Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may grant, under certain conditions, Union financial assistance to the Member State concerned. The President of the Council shall inform the European Parliament of the decision taken.’ This article mentions ‘exceptional occurrences beyond its (i.e. a Member State's) control’, and the legislator clearly opted for this general formulation to allow the adoption of political decisions par excellence . In view of the above, will the Council say: Does it intend to draw up a proposal for financial aid to Greece? If so, has it sounded out Member States on this matter? Has it drawn up possible terms for granting such aid? Which procedure is used for taking such decisions?
