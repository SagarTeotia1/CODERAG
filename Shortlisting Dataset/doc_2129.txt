of the European Central Bank, where the act the validity or interpretation of which is in dispute originates from one of them, and to the European Parliament and the Council where the act the validity or interpretation of which is in dispute was adopted jointly by those two institutions. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Agreement with the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, Iceland and Norway are entitled to participate in preliminary ruling proceedings, thereby submitting statements of case or written observations in cases where a court or a tribunal of a Member State refer to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling a question falling within the scope of the agreement. It therefore became necessary to amend the Protocol of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in order to adjust the content of Article 20 of that Protocol with the international obligations resulting from the Agreement concluded by the Council with Iceland and Norway. This adjustment will also avoid the need to amend Article 20 in the event of any future agreement providing for the participation of non-member States in preliminary ruling proceedings. Accordingly, the European Court of Justice - jurisdiction ensuring the uniform application of Community law, and thereby giving judgement by way of preliminary rulings - has requested the Council, in accordance with Article 245(2), to amend the Protocol on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. The European Commission - guardian of the Treaties - having been consulted on the draft Council decision, accepted this amendment and approved it. In light of the above, your rapporteur fully endorses the text proposed by the Court of Justice.
