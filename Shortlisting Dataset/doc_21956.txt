WRITTEN QUESTION E-0685/10 by Jean-Luc Mélenchon (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (16 February 2010) Subject: Hosting by the Commission of a delegation from Porfirio Lobo Sosa's government The Commission is hosting a delegation from the Honduran Government this week with the aim of reopening negotiations on an association agreement between the EU and Central America. Porfirio Lobo Sosa’s government owes its existence to the coup d’état of 28 June 2009. Mr Lobo Sosa’s party, the National Party of Honduras, has never condemned either the coup d’état or the crimes committed by Roberto Micheletti’s de facto government. It is not offering any guarantees of a return to institutional democracy. The Spanish Presidency is mistaken in saying that Mr Lobo Sosa’s investiture as president on 27 January 2010 makes it possible to normalise relations with Honduras. 1. How can the EU resume negotiations with this government, when it is so concerned about human rights on other occasions? 2. Should the Commission not wait until Mr Lobo Sosa’s government has taken significant steps to ensure a return to democracy? 3. Does the Commission not think it necessary, therefore, to wait until a strict separation of the legislative, executive and judiciary has been restored, the coup d’état of 28 June 2009 and the crimes committed by Mr Micheletti’s de facto government have been condemned, and the rights of members of the National Resistance Front and of the former president, Manuel Zelaya, and his staff have been guaranteed? 4. Does this mean that the desire for trade liberalisation is worth more to the EU than the rights of the Honduran people, and thus of all peoples?
