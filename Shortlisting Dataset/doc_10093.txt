WRITTEN QUESTION P-1325/06 by Ivo Belet (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 March 2006) Subject: The right of non-Belgian EU citizens to vote and to stand for election In Belgium, members of the Social Welfare Council (the governing board of the Public Centre for Social Welfare) are indirectly elected, by means of a vote taken among the members of the municipal council. As non-Belgian EU citizens have the right to vote and to stand for election in municipal council elections, they also have a say in the election of the members of the Social Welfare Council. In eight municipalities in Belgium (Drogenbos, Kraainem, Linkebeek, Sint-Genesius-Rode, Wemmel and Wezembeek-Oppem and Komen-Waasten and Fourons), members of the Social Welfare Council are directly elected by the assembly of municipal council electors on the same day as municipal council elections are held (Article 17a, Organic Law on Public Social Welfare Centres of 8 July 1976). Despite the above clause, non-Belgian citizens of the European Union are not permitted to vote or stand for election when elections are held to the Social Welfare Council in these municipalities, elections which nonetheless are inherent in the election of the municipal council in Belgium. Non-Belgian EU citizens therefore do not enjoy the right to vote and to stand for election on the same terms as Belgian EU citizens. 1. Does the denial to non-Belgian EU citizens of the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in elections to the Social Welfare Council in the above municipalities accord with Article 19 of the EC Treaty? 2. If not, what steps will the Commission take to guarantee non-Belgian EU citizens the right to vote and to stand for allocation on the same terms as Belgian EU citizens?
