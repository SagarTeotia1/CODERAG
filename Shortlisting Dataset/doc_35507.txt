Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (16 July 2007) The Commission has no information concerning the alleged killing of killer whales by Spanish fishermen or about the subsequent sale of whale meat to Japan. The Commission has information concerning the killing of killer whales in the Straits of Gibraltar in 2004 and 2006. However, it appears that these incidents occurred in water under the jurisdiction of Morocco. While the mortalities might have been the result of fisheries interactions, there is no indication that Community vessels were involved More information has been reported by the International Whaling Commission on this matter. It may be found in the following documents:http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/sci_com/SCRepFiles2007/59-Rep1.pdfhttp://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/sci_com/SCRepFiles2007/Annex%20L%20Final.pdf . This issue was raised during the last meeting of the International Whaling Commission (Alaska, May 2007). Its Scientific Committee expressed concern about the status of the killer whales in the Strait of Gibraltar and urged the relevant local and national agencies in Spain and Morocco to cooperate to monitor the status of the species and to assess the need for conservation action.
