unfortunately has not always achieved the desired effectiveness in terms of results; E. whereas the 62nd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) will be its last session prior to the effective establishment of the UN Human Rights Council, F. whereas an EP ad hoc delegation has been established for this year's annual session of the UNCHR, has been the case for the past seven years, Human Rights Council 1. Welcomes the adoption of the resolution creating the HRC; notes in this respect the EU's contribution towards the outcome of the negotiations; 2. Welcomes the establishment of a reduced, permanent UN body, directly elected by the General Assembly, as a first step in meeting the 2005 World Summit's commitment to strengthen the United Nations' human rights machinery; 3.

Regrets that the idea of the election of members of the HRC by a strengthened, two-thirds majority has not been retained; considers, nevertheless, that the procedure whereby members are elected directly and individually by secret ballot by an absolute majority of the General Assembly and governments are required to consider candidates' human rights records and commitments could prevent gross human rights violators from sitting in the Council; welcomes the setting-up of a suspension mechanism, by a two-thirds majority vote of the General Assembly, of the membership rights in the Council of a member that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights; 8. Calls on all UN member states to endeavour to elect the candidate countries with highest human rights standards, which have ratified core human rights treaties, complied with their reporting obligations, issued open invitations to the UN special procedures and endeavoured to implement their recommendations; calls on the EU to insist that
