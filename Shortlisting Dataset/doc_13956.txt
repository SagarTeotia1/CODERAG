Question for written answer E-000652/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Roger Helmer (ECR) (3 February 2011) Subject: UK tax for employees of the Commission and other EU institutions The Commission may be aware that British MEPs subject to the Statute for Members, who pay EU tax in Brussels at a low rate, are required by the UK tax authorities to make an additional UK tax payment so that their total income tax is what it would have been if the whole salary had been paid in the UK. Is the Commission aware whether the same rules apply to British staff working in the Commission and other EU institutions? In particular, does Commissioner and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Baroness Ashton (apparently the world's highest-paid politician) pay a supplementary UK tax?
