9999/C Q999 E/080 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1071/04 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (26 March 2004) Subject: The growing 'speculative bubble' and the crisis in the financial system In its quarterly report of 8 March 2004 the Bank for International Settlements in Basle stated that the aggregate value of turnover of financial derivatives expanded by 26% in 2003, compared with the previous year, to US$ 874 trillion. This figure does not include Over the Counter (OTC) derivatives, which showed an increase of 42 trillion in just one year, reaching a notional value of $ 170 trillion in June 2003 At present world GDP is equivalent to only $ 41 trillion, whilst trading worldwide totalled $ 7.84 trillion in 2003 (6.27 for trade in goods and 1.57 for trade in services). The turnover of financial derivatives on the markets plus that of OTC derivatives contracts add up to a figure 250 times total trade in goods and services worldwide. How can it be that such an enormous discrepancy between the real economy and speculation is not being tackled seriously in real terms? Can the Commission say: 1. how it views this catastrophic financial situation; 2. whether it does not consider that the collapse of the financial system would be an unprecedented disaster for the world economy and the European economy in particular; 3. what proposals it intends to submit to avert this risk and tackle the crisis in the financial system?
