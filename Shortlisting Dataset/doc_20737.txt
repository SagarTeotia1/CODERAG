Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (13 May 2011) Protocol No 29 on the system of public broadcasting in the Member States annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU has affirmed, in line with the subsidiarity principle, the competence of each Member State to define the public service remit, to organise public service broadcasting and its financing system. The EC law instrument in the field of broadcasting (Directive 2010/13/EU http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:095:0001:0024:EN:PDF ) only provides minimum harmonisation with regard to public policy objectives like protection of minors, hate speech, access to European content or commercial communication. The directive does not address the issue raised by the Honourable Member and the Commission cannot intervene in the matter concerned on this basis.
