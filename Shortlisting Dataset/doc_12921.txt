WRITTEN QUESTION P-1101/05 by Lorenzo Cesa (PPE-DE) to the Commission (14 March 2005) Subject: Reducing regulatory instruments on the European telecommunications market The European telecommunications market is currently supporting an important innovation process which involves developing infrastructure and technologies to provide innovative services, which represent one of the essential means of achieving the knowledge development and dissemination goals defined by the Union in Lisbon. This technological revolution, which will extend the supply of convergent services, must be accompanied by a reduction in regulatory instruments, so as to allow the sector to develop according to competitive trends with the US market, where regulators have felt the need not to extend the traditional regulatory apparatus to new services. What measures does the Commission intend to take in 2005 in support of a regulatory policy which will be favourable to investment and consistent with the objectives set in this framework, with a view to providing effective support for the economic growth objectives envisaged in the review of the Lisbon Strategy?
