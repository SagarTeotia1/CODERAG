WRITTEN QUESTION E-2592/10 by Syed Kamall (ECR) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Business aviation slot allocations I have been contacted by a constituent who works in the business aviation industry and is concerned that current EU slot regulations discriminate against business aviation operators at major EU airports. My constituent tells me that airport coordination has been an attempt to ration limited slot provisions, but its use of historical rights has not kept pace with changes in the aviation industry in recent years. He also says that attempts to combine efficiency, equality and stability have favoured scheduled airlines, regardless of indicators such as the overall economic value of passengers. He claims that the result has been that business aviation carriers have been squeezed out from major airports to smaller, often less accessible secondary airports. In economic terms, this seems counter-intuitive, given that 80 % of scheduled airline traffic is leisure travel, whereas almost 80 % of business aviation traffic is business-related. I would like to ask: 1. What plans, if any, does the Commission have to review the way slots are allocated in the EU? 2. Does the Commission feel that such a potential review should be devised in accordance with basic principles and not with existing regulations? 3. Does the Commission feel that the principle of economic value should be a key factor so as to ensure that business aviation industry concerns are properly taken into account? 4. Can the Commission confirm that business aviation operators may be termed ‘programme non-scheduled’ with regard to granting historic slot rights?
