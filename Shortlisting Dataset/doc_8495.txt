WRITTEN QUESTION E-0638/08 by Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven (Verts/ALE) and Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM) to the Commission (12 February 2008) Subject: The children from the home in Sladuk Kladenec, Stara Zagora district, Bulgaria Bulgaria has the largest number of institutionalised children with disabilities in the EU. This is due to a long-lasting state policy of encouraging abandonment and isolation of children with disabilities, who were placed into social care homes in small villages. One of these homes is in Mogilino, now renowned thanks to a BBC documentary, ‘Bulgaria's Abandoned Children’. Consequently there has been pressure to close this care home, yet a plethora of these homes still exist in Bulgaria caring for a total of 1 205 children. These homes are in small villages, where children are denied access to rehabilitation centres, their families, adequate healthcare and integration with society at large. During the winter of 1997, 13 children died in the home in Dzhurkovo. This archipelago of isolated care homes and the inhuman conditions in the home are a violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of the UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. One of these homes is the home in Sladuk Kladenec, Stara Zagora district, where now there are 75 children. 1. Will the Commission investigate the situation in these care homes? 2. Can the Commission reassure Parliament that EU funding for disability programmes is properly allocated? 3. Does the Commission know when the children of the Sladuk Kladenec care home will be moved to Stara Zagora, where they will have better access to rehabilitation, healthcare, education, chances to be adopted and a chance to integrate back into their families and society at large?
