having regard to the report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the opinions of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Fisheries ( A5-0198/2001 ), 1.

Asks to be consulted again should the Commission intend to amend the proposal substantially or replace it with another text; 4. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and Commission.
