WRITTEN QUESTION E-5223/07 by Bárbara Dührkop Dührkop (PSE) and Elena Valenciano Martínez-Orozco (PSE) to the Commission (23 October 2007) Subject: Adoptions in Nepal A total of 450 families from the EU Member States, 175 of them Spanish, have now been waiting for more than a year to receive the children they have adopted in Nepal. The adoptive parents have visited the orphanages, met the children they have adopted, and fulfilled all the procedural requirements. The Nepalese Government has been postponing the transfer of these children for over a year now, holding out dates and promises. Can the Commission, acting through its President, make diplomatic representations to the government of Nepal with a view to ensuring a happy end to this adoption saga?
