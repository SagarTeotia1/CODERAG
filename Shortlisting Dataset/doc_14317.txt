WRITTEN QUESTION E-2331/08 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 April 2008) Subject: Nanotechnology in foodstuffs Despite large gaps in our knowledge concerning safety and likely dangers to health, at present there are no rules governing the use of nanotechnology. 1. Can the Commission provide details of the nanoproducts used in articles available on the European market, in particular in foodstuffs? 2. If not, when does the Commission plan to set up a database on nanoproducts? 3. How does the Commission assess the problem of the health risks posed by nanoparticles, in particular the greater likelihood that they will penetrate the lungs and cross the blood/brain barrier? 4. What definitions of ‘nanotechnology’ and ‘nanoparticle’ does the Commission employ and why? At what size does a particle become a nanoparticle? 5. What view does the Commission take of the health risks posed by and the marketing of nanoproducts, given the lack of any risk assessment method, a problem which the Commission's own committees of experts have acknowledged? 6. When will the Commission establish the legal framework for nanofoodstuffs which is currently lacking? Given that their size represents an innovation, should they not be covered by the regulation on innovative foodstuffs? 7. Will the Commission call for a moratorium on the use of nanotechnology in foodstuffs until all health risks have been ruled out and a legal framework has been created?
