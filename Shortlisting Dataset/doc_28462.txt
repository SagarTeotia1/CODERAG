Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (28 January 2008) According to the Community law, it is up to the Member States to fix the arrangements on the exercise of the right to vote by citizens of the Union who reside outside of their Member State but wish to participate in elections of their home Member State. The Commission cannot therefore intervene and advise Member States to modify the rules applied. As regards a universal voting procedure system in the EU, Community law foresees the possibility for the Parliament to present such a proposal as far as the elections for the Parliament are concerned.
