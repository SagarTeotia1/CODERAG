9999/C Q999 E/020 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0232/04 by Roger Helmer (PPE-DE) to the Commission (22 January 2004) Subject: Euro Does the Commission agree with former Commission President Jacques Delors, who has been reported as saying that the euro-zone has failed to exploit the economic potential of the single currency, and that therefore, with hindsight, the UK was right to retain the pound and to decline to join the euro? Does the Commission as a whole agree with current Commission President Romano Prodi, who has said that the Stability and Growth Pact, designed to underpin the single currency, is 'stupid'?
