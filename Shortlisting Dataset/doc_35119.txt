provided by the competent authorities has been considered as adequate by the Commission. In this context it is worth insisting that the Water Framework Directive establishes that Member States should ensure by 2010 that the water-pricing policies provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently. This is particularly important in regions suffering from water scarcity situations like south-east Spain. A communication COM(2007)414 final. on water scarcity and droughts was adopted on 18 July 2007. Land-use planning has been identified as one of the main drivers of water use. There is also a huge potential for water saving. According to the communication, water saving should become the priority and all possibilities to improve water efficiency should therefore be explored. Additional water supply infrastructure should be considered as an option only when other options have been exhausted, including the implementation of effective water pricing policy and cost-effective alternatives of water saving and improved water efficiency. Regarding the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑3137/07 , and in continuation of the information already provided together to his previous Written Questions E‑1563/06 and E‑3330/06 , the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that ‘every time an official request for co-financing is submitted to the Commission (Major project and/or Cohesion Fund project) an ad-hoc decision is taken, after thorough examination of the file accompanying such a request and after a possible consultation of the European Investment Bank’ (EIB). Therefore, the consultation of the EIB, following the provisions of Article 26(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, OJ L 161, 26.6.1999. , is not compulsory. The Commission considers that the modified project, as proposed by the competent authorities, is the only viable solution to implement the project approved in 2003, for which the competent authorities concluded that they would not be able to comply with the conditions set in DecisionC(2003)5311. Regarding the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑3139/07 and E‑3140/07 , the Commission can confirm that Article 2 of Decision C(2003)5311 as modified by Decision C(2006)6739 of the 12 December 2006, for instance that ‘Exploitation standards of the water transfer have to be elaborated taking into account, as a priority, all the necessities of the Basin and, in particular, the environmental necessities, by establishing and respecting an “ecological water flow” of the River before proceeding to any water transfer…’ continues to apply. The Monitoring group for the implementation of this Major Group, which should be put in place very soon, after the relevant decision taken by the Monitoring Committee of the Valencia 00-06 OP on 15 June 2007, would have as one of its tasks to follow up the elaboration of the exploitation standards in the sense described above. Incidentally, this is one of the main reasons why the competent authorities proposed the modification approved by Decision C(2006)6739. Regarding the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑3141/07 , and because the competent authorities considered that they would not be able to comply with the conditions set in Decision C(2003)5311, they have
