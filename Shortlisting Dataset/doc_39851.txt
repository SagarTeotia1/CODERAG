Consequently, notes that the Centre consolidated its public health functions, enhanced the capacities of its disease-specific programmes, further developed partnerships and improved its managerial structures; 3. Calls on the Centre to set out, in its table to be annexed to the Court of Auditors’ next report, a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year, so as to enable the discharge authority to assess its performance more effectively from one year to the next; Carry-over of appropriations 4. Notes that the Court of Auditors points out that about EUR 16 200 000 (representing 40 % of the Centre’s total budget) have had to be carried over; is consequently concerned that this situation is at odds with the principle of annuality and shows weaknesses in the programming and subsequent implementation of the Centre’s budget; 5. Notes that the Centre’s accounts for the financial year 2008 show income from interest of EUR 313 000 and that, in accordance with the Financial Regulation, a sum of EUR 307 000 had to be paid back to the Commission; concludes from the annual closure of accounts and the amount of interest payments that the Centre maintains enormously high cash reserves over long periods; notes that as of 31 December 2008 the Centre’s cash reserves amounted to EUR 16 705 090,95; calls on the Commission to examine ways of ensuring that the principle of needs-based cash management, as laid down in Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002, is implemented to the full and what changes in approach are needed to ensure that the Centre’s cash reserves are kept as low as possible on a long-term basis; 6. Takes note of the Centre’s efforts to conclude procurement and contracting activities initiated in 2008 early in 2009 so as to lower the carry-over level; The Centre’s seat 7. Is concerned that as of 31 December 2008 there was still no seat agreement between the Centre and the Swedish Government as there were still many outstanding issues that needed further negotiation; points out that in its discharge for the financial year 2007 the discharge authority was already expressing concern at the Court of Auditors’ observation that the Centre had disbursed EUR 500 000 on renovation works on the buildings rented for its premises, and that, as in 2006, these works had been decided upon by direct agreement between the Centre and the owner without specifying the nature of the works and the deadlines and payment conditions; nevertheless welcomes the fact that an agreement was concluded in March 2009 on personal identity numbers and supports the Centre's efforts to find definitive solutions with the Swedish government ; 8. Reminds the interinstitutional working group on decentralised agencies to address this issue in general terms in its discussions; Human resources 9. Points out that there are still weaknesses in the planning of recruitment procedures; is concerned, in particular, that by the end of 2008 only 101 of the 130 posts authorised had been filled; 10.
