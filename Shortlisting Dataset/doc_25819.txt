WRITTEN QUESTION E-1940/06 by Mechtild Rothe (PSE) to the Commission (4 May 2006) Subject: Aspartame study (Ramazzini Foundation) Italian researchers from the Ramazzini Foundation published the interim findings of a carcinogenicity study on the sweetener aspartame in July 2005. The European Food Safety Authority is currently assessing the study and will be collating it with existing safety data. Aspartame is used as a sweetener in a substantial number of different foodstuffs. No recommendation has as yet been made to consumers to make changes to their diet in respect of aspartame. What is the Commission's position on the so-called Ramazzini study? Does the Commission already have results in connection with this study?
