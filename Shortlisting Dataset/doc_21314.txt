WRITTEN QUESTION E-0325/10 by Angelika Werthmann (NI) to the Commission (8 February 2010) Subject: Equality between men and women Article 23 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights explicitly states the following: ‘Article 23 — Equality between men and women Equality between men and women must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay. The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.’ The social reality belies these fine words. In the Gender Gap Index 2009 Austria is only in 42nd place; in 2008 it was in 29th place. Women in Austria earn 25.5 % less than men (based on the hourly rate of pay in 2007), a negative trend which is continuing. What measures will the Commission, in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, take to turn laws which are on the statute books into laws which have a real impact on people's lives?
