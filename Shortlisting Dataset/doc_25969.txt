with the need to achieve full and decent employment: re-conversion of the car industry towards sustainable transport services, extension of railway networks and supply of spatially inclusive and comprehensive regional train services (Programme Rail Europe 2025), promotion of 'green' shipbuilding and stabilisation of the steel industry in that context; insists that the EU and the Member States should accompany such re-conversion by measures for job retention, training, re-training and skills development, and secure employment transitions for workers in the industries concerned; 6. Points out that the EU and Member States should implement mechanisms for a targeted and democratically controlled public steering of investment from the new recovery plan to those sectors of the economy most affected by the crisis, to newly emerging sustainable industries and services and to disadvantaged regions; insists on the active involvement and participation of those affected by these investments; stresses that whenever Member States provide aids, re-capitalisation and financial guarantees for companies in trouble, this should translate accordingly into increased public shares in voting interest and future profits and be used to influence companies investment strategies; points out that Member States should implement measures to enhance economic democracy, change the governance of companies in order to strengthen the position of workers, trade unions and consumers and the social and environmental dimension in the strategic choices of companies and public services; 7.

Highlights the Commission's estimate that EU-27 public debt on average will rise to 84 per cent or more in 2011, despite 'fiscal consolidation' efforts of Member States; points out that recent developments on a possible failure of Greece to avoid bankruptcy could trigger a 'worst case scenario' of further Member States failing on debt, thus blowing the euro-zone to pieces; considers that there is an urgent need to develop a 'plan B' for countering such a scenario, based on a policy mix of negotiating a cancellation and reshuffling of public debt with banks and financial institutions and also bolder steps for unconventional measures of the ECB to expand its balance sheet and to monetize debt by purchasing sovereign bonds through its 'structural operations' toolkit, in order to avoid economic collapse; 9. Calls on the Council to broaden the mandate of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), so that their lending policies can cover the whole range of the new European Recovery Plan (e.g. including sustainable industrial policy etc.); 10.
