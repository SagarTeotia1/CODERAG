Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (15 September 2009) Directive 2006/12/EC OJ L 114, 27.4.2006. of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste lays down the general principles governing waste management. Article 15 of Directive 2006/12/EC introduces the ‘polluter pays’ principle, according to which the cost of disposing of waste must be borne by: (a) the holder who has waste handled by a waste collector or by a licensed waste management undertaking; and/or (b) the previous holders or the producer of the product from which the waste came. Furthermore, the responsibility of the Member States is defined in Articles 4 and 8: — Article 4 provides that ‘Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment’. The same article stipulates that ‘Member States shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste’. — According to Article 8, Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that any holder of waste ‘(a) has it handled by a private or public waste collector or by an undertaking which carries out the operations listed in Annex II A or II B; or (b) recovers or disposes of it himself in accordance with the provisions of this directive.’ As regards the site of the former ‘Diana’ factory, the Greek authorities are responsible for ensuring compliance with Community environmental legislation of relevance to a lawful waste management. The Commission will enquire of the Greek authorities in order to clarify the precise circumstances of this particular case.
