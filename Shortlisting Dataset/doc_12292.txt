Question for written answer P-001361/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jan Philipp Albrecht (Verts/ALE) (15 February 2011) Subject: Suspension of Brunswick airport building project following the discovery of hermit beetles On 17 May 2010 nature conservationists discovered the larvae of a strictly protected species of flower chafer (Osmoderma eremita), which is threatened with extinction and whose habitats are designated as protected areas under the Habitats Directive and the Berne Convention. The larvae were discovered in Querum Forest, the site of projected works for the enlargement of Brunswick Airport. Although the existence of the habitat has been confirmed and the Commission has for over seven months been considering what further action to take, the airport company is going ahead with the project. In view of this: 1. What is holding up the EU Commission’s deliberations regarding Brunswick research airport and the hermit beetles? What stage has been reached by the proceedings? When may a decision be expected? 2. One of the possible outcomes mentioned last year by the EU Commission was a halt to building works. In the meantime, these have made considerable progress. Is it still possible to halt them? What might realistically be the alternative consequences for the airport company at the present stage of the investigations? Could the company be fined and, if so, how much? 3. We have been informed that the Commission has requested additional information from the Federal Environment Agency. What is the nature of this missing information which it needed to make a decision?
