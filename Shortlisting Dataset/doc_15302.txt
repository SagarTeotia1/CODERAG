merger cases are becoming increasingly complex and a large number of the merger control operations are extremely complicated, including an increased geographical scope of mergers and required simultaneous analysis of several different markets, D. whereas, although industrial relocation and restructuring are not new developments, their scale and the basis on which they are occurring have undergone a decisive change in the wake of economic globalisation, E. whereas industrial change may provide new opportunities but it also has economic implications and adverse employment and social consequences, and therefore it is urgent for the EU to increase its capacity to anticipate it, F. whereas company relocation can often be associated with a range of socio-economic problems in the regions, for example, increasing levels of long-term unemployment, skills mismatch, decline in purchasing power and the loss of key markets for local producers, G. whereas public policy concerning industrial relocation should seek to achieve the following objectives: full employment, sustainable growth, social and economic cohesion, competitiveness of Community industry and fairer distribution of the benefits of free trade as well as high level of consumer protection, 1.

Asks in particular that this coordinating centre produce an up-dated report on industrial change in the EU twice a year, to be dealt with by the Commission and by the competent Committees in the European Parliament; 4. Asks the information provided by this coordinating centre on economic, financial, technological, territorial and social developments within the EU be dealt with inside the Commission and the Council in a co-ordinated manner between the different departments concerned in order to take responsibility for and manage the follow-up of all aspects of industrial and technological change in a more comprehensive way, including those related to competition policy and the control of mergers with a Community dimension; 5. Points out that Europe needs to create the conditions for a modern economy, in particular through new information technologies, development of new services and creation of new businesses; strongly believes that in managing industrial change the EU must create sustainable economic development through competitiveness based on quality, initiative and innovation and a European social model based on
