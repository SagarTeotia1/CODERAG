to the policy-holder under the terms of the contract, - expenses, including commissions; -taking credit for future premiums due; (ii) the use of a retrospective method is allowed, if it can be shown that the resulting technical provisions are not lower than would be required under a sufficiently prudent prospective calculation or if a prospective method cannot be used for the type of contract involved; (iii) a prudent valuation is not a "best estimate" valuation, but shall include an appropriate margin for adverse deviation of the relevant factors; (iv) the method of valuation for the technical provisions must not only be prudent in itself, but must also be so having regard to the method of valuation for the assets covering those provisions; (v) technical provisions shall be calculated separately for each contract. The use of appropriate approximations or generalizations is allowed, however, where they are likely to give approximately the same result as individual calculations. The principle of separate calculation shall in no way prevent the establishment of additional provisions for general risks which are not individualized; (vi) where the surrender value of a contract is guaranteed, the amount of the mathematical provisions for the contract at any time shall be at least as great as the value guaranteed at that time. B. The rate of interest used shall be chosen prudently. It shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the competent authority in the home Member State , applying the following principles: (a) for all contracts, the competent authority of the undertaking's home Member State shall fix one or more maximum rates of interest, in particular in accordance with the following rules: (i) when contracts contain an interest rate guarantee, the competent authority in the home Member State shall set a single maximum rate of interest. It may differ according to the currency in which the contract is denominated, provided that it is not more than 60 % of the rate on bond issues by the State in whose currency the contract is denominated. In the case of a contract denominated in ecus, this limit shall be set by reference to ecu-denominated issues by the Community institutions. If a Member State decides, pursuant to the second sentence of the preceding paragraph, to set a maximum rate of interest for contracts denominated in another Member State's currency, it shall first consult the competent authority of the Member State in whose currency the contract is denominated; (ii) however, when the assets of the undertaking are not valued at their purchase price, a Member State may stipulate that one or more maximum rates may be calculated taking into account the yield on the corresponding assets currently held, minus a prudential margin and, in particular for contracts with periodic premiums, furthermore taking into account the anticipated yield on future assets. The prudential margin and the maximum rate or rates of interest applied to the anticipated yield on future assets shall be fixed by the competent authority of the home Member State; (b) the establishment of a maximum rate of interest shall not imply
