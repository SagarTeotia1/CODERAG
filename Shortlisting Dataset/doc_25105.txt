Question for written answer E-001108/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (8 February 2012) Subject: Financial Pact for Greece The Financial Pact and the final agreement on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) will be at the heart of the Council of the EU Heads of State in Brussels on 30 January. The Prime Minister, Loukas Papademos, held a meeting on Friday, 29 January, with the political leaders who are supporting the Greek Government and the basic guidelines for the negotiations at the summit were agreed on. At a time when a new programme is being proposed that sets harsh, humiliating terms for Greece, I would like to ask the Commission: 1. Are the terms of the troika’s new programme of demands for Greece in the sectors referred to in Greece’s new loan agreement in alignment with Community law? 2. Do these terms comply with the Lisbon Treaty and are they in alignment with the Community acquis ?
