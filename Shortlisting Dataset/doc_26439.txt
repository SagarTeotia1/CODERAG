extend the lending mandate- in line with the Neighbourhood Policy- to Russia and the WNIS, Western New Independent States, (Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus), with a new envelope of € 300 million. A substantial part of this € 300m ( ECOFIN has already adopted conclusions indicating a preference for € 500m) is likely to go to environmental and nuclear safety projects. This was mainly the use of the € 100m made available under the current mandate. 18. Taking all of the above into consideration, the new revised ceilings proposed by the Commission looks as follows (rapporteur's highlights inserted). Commission proposal, (€ million) South-Eastern Neighbours 9 185 Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, fYROM, Rumania, Turkey Mediterranean 6 520 Algeria, , Egypt Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and Gaza/West-Bank Latin America and Asia 2 480 unchanged South Africa 825 unchanged Turkey "Customs Union facility" and "Earthquake facility" 1 050 unchanged Baltic Sea Basin of Russia 100 unchanged Russia and Western New Independent States 300 Belarus, Moldova, Russia and the Ukraine Total lending mandate 20 460 19. As can be seen, the picture is already quite complicated, as, although the global amounts do not change much, the changes within the different envelopes are substantial. 20. In fact, the rapporteur considers that the Commission should have presented a table with the net effect on the ceilings for each region, taking into account the fact that Turkey is moving category but remains unchanged and that the accession countries are lifted out. The following is the rapporteur's table but, given the complexities involved, should be confirmed by the Commission: Approximate "net effect" on lending ceilings for the countries comprising each region, following the transfer of Turkey and the removal of the accession countries (€ million) South-Eastern Neighbours +/- 0 The lifting-out of accession countries (about 2,1 billion) is cancelled out by the addition of Turkey (also about 2,1 billion) Mediterranean +2180 The total of the "surplus margin" transferred to remaining Meda (after Turkey has been moved) Latin America and Asia +/- 0 unchanged South Africa +/- 0 unchanged Turkey "Customs Union facility" and "Earthquake facility" +/- 0 unchanged Baltic Sea Basin of Russia +/- 0 unchanged Russia and Western New Independent States + 300 New: Belarus, Moldavia, Russia and the Ukraine 21. In order to have a more complete picture of the different instruments at the EU's disposal, the rapporteur wishes to include a general table showing the grant assistance (including macro-financial aid) going to various regions under headings 4 and 7 (External Action and Pre-Accession) and including the EDF, which is outside the EU budget. € million Budget 2004 * % Pre-Accession Strategy 1 732 16,6 % Asia (including Afghanistan) 616 5,9 % Balkans 675 6,5 % Eastern Europe &Central Asia 535 5,1 % Mediterranean & Middle East (including Iraq, 160 million) 1 002 9,6 % Latin America 312 3,0 % Thematic programmes (all regions, including Emergency Aid) 2 258 21,7 % Total Budget 7 130 68,5 % EDF (77 ACP countries) 3 275 31,5 % Grand Total Assistance 2004 10 405 100%
