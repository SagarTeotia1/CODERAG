Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (10 January 2012) 1, 2. Pico island has benefitted from more than EUR 40 million of Structural Funds support under the Proconvergência ERDF programme (2007-13). A project for the redevelopment of the port of ‘Madalena’ was also approved in the framework of the Territorial Development POVT programme, with EUR 11 million of support from the Cohesion Fund. The Azores as a whole will receive EUR 966 million of ERDF funding during the 2007-2013 period, plus a further EUR 70 million from the Cohesion Fund and EUR 190 million from the ESF. The ESF Azores programme has already organised 84 training courses in Pico Island involving 813 persons. 3. The Commission recently proposed an amendment to the General Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, OJ L 210, 31.7.2006. which will allow an additional 10 % top-up reimbursement to countries benefiting from an adjustment programme during the duration of the programme. This amendment will benefit the Azores as it will increase the ERDF and Cohesion Fund reimbursement rates from the current 85 % to 95 %. Under the rules of shared management applicable to cohesion policy, it is up to the national authorities to approve projects according to the conditions fixed in the national programmes. Therefore, the Commission suggests the Honourable Member contacts directly the programmes managing authorities and consult the website of the ERDF and ESF programmes ‘Açores’ 2007-2013: PROCONVERGENCIA Caminho do Meio, 58 — São Carlos 9701-853 Angra do Heroísmo Tel.: 295 206 380 Fax: 295 206 381/332 774 Site: www.proconvergencia.azores.gov.pt RUMOS Instituto de Desenvolvimento Regional Travessa do Cabido, 16 9000-715 Funchal Tel.: +351 291 214 000 Site: idr.srpf@gov.madeira.pt
