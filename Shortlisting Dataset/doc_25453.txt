Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2011) The proposed Equal Treatment Directive Proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, 2.7.2008, COM(2008)426 final. aims at complementing the existing EU legal framework which prohibits discrimination in employment. The proposed directive is currently being debated in the European Parliament and in the Council of Ministers. It is these two legislative institutions of the European Union which will decide whether or no to agree on the proposed directive. In a manner similar to other instruments of public international law (like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the European Convention of Human Rights), the Commission holds the view that the concept of sexual orientation in the meaning of the proposed Directive as well as Directive 2000/78/EC does not cover the sexual practices mentioned in the question raised by the Honourable Member. The Commission consistently rejects any assimilation of homosexuality with such practices.
