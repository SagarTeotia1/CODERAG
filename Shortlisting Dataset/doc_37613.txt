Question for written answer E-003498/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 David Casa (PPE) (11 April 2011) Subject: EU investment policy Some argue that the new EU competences resulting from the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the Common Commercial Policy could be used as a means of promoting EU values, including in relation to human rights and the environment. One way of doing this would be to include such issues in the terms of bilateral investment treaties. Has the Commission carried out any research into this possibility and the potential effectiveness of such tools in the promotion of EU values?
