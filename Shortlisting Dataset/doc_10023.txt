reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions. . By banning the use of vehicles complying with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) Regulation 83 which sets emission limit values identical to those laid down in the relevant EC legislation, the Dutch measure would infringe the obligations laid down under that Agreement. This could undermine the recognition of EU type approvals by the other Contracting Parties of the 1958 Agreement and would thus have clearly disproportionate repercussions on the EC’s vehicle exports to those countries. In the light of these considerations, the Commission has therefore concluded that the measure envisaged by the Dutch authorities was not proportionate. The Commission’s Decision has been taken in accordance with the provisions of the EC Treaty and cannot be interpreted as a lack of cooperation with the national authorities. The Dutch authorities can make use of their right to appeal to the Court of Justice against the Commission’s Decision.
