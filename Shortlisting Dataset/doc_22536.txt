Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (25 November 2003) Due to the course of events in Cancun, Ministers did not have the opportunity to discuss the Agricultural part of the draft Ministerial Declaration submitted by Mr Derbez. This chapter contained some proposals of great concern to the Commission, notably in the pillars of domestic support and export competition. Had the discussion started in Cancun, the Commission would have sought the necessary changes to the text. The Commission has based its position on the decisions on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform taken in Luxembourg in 2003. The depth and width of the CAP reform will enable the Commission to continue working on this basis in the future so as to maintain the consistency of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations with the Community's domestic framework.
