ORAL QUESTION H-0437/04 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Mairead McGuinness to the Council Subject: Darfur and the actions of the Sudanese Government In Darfur, hundreds of people are dying each day from hunger, disease and continued violence, which shows no signs of abating. 70 000 people have already lost their lives and hundreds of thousands of lives are still at risk. Innocent civilians continue to be attacked and the number of displaced people is growing as people flee the violence. The civilians live in constant fear of attack and rely on humanitarian assistance for food, water and means of survival. The ongoing violence and insecurity is seriously hampering the humanitarian effort, preventing access to many areas, thus augmenting the suffering and further risking the lives of these innocent people. In light of the seriousness of this situation, what is being done by the Council to ensure that this crisis is placed and remains high on the agenda of the EU? What is the Council doing to ensure that the Sudanese Government is heeding international law and the agreements signed with UN agencies?
