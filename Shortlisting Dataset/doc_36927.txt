Question for written answer E-003834/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Giancarlo Scottà (EFD) (26 April 2011) Subject: Young farmers Is the Commission aware of the position of the European Council of Young Farmers (CEJA) in favour of a European policy for generational renewal in the agricultural sector and a series of political measures for the post-2013 CAP? As things stand, only 6 % of farmers are aged under 35. The CEJA proposals would introduce priority for young people under both the first and second pillar, modifying the co‑financing rate under the latter, as well as making provision for a reserve fund, organising exchange programmes and introducing innovation premiums. In view of this and the issues raised by CEJA, can the Commission state its position on the proposed measures? Will it introduce additional instruments to encourage young people to become entrepreneurs in this sector?
