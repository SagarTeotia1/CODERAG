Question for written answer E-004946/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oriol Junqueras Vies (Verts/ALE) (19 May 2011) Subject: Plan to link Formigal, Astún and Candanchú ski resorts via the Canal Roya valley In March 2011 the regional government of Aragón, Spain, announced plans to alter its draft decree on the creation of the inventory of sites of geological interest in Aragón and the protection system applicable to them. If the plans go ahead, Canal Roya valley would be excluded from the inventory, paving the way for construction work aimed at linking the Formigal, Astún and Candanchú ski resorts. For the past four years, the area has qualified for the preventative protection provided by the decree establishing the Plan de Ordenación de los Recursos Naturales (natural resources management plan). The Plan should have culminated in the founding of Anayet national park, which would have incorporated the Canal Roya valley. However, despite that protection and the promises made by the President of the regional government, Marcelino Iglesias, that no decision affecting the area would be taken until the Plan was approved (even though no progress has been made in that respect in four years), ever more decisive steps are being taken towards destruction of the site. Is the Commission aware of developments in the plans to link the ski resorts and the complete lack of progress made by the Aragón government in drawing up protection measures? By putting at risk Canal Roya and what should now be Anayet national park, does the Commission believe that the Aragón government is acting in line with its obligations under EC law?
