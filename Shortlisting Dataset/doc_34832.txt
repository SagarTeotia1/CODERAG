WRITTEN QUESTION E-5846/09 by Frieda Brepoels (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (30 November 2009) Subject: European standards There are still different standards for plugs, sockets and voltage in the 27 Member States of the EU. Some travellers express concern at this and are calling for a uniform European standard. 1. Has Cenelec already looked into the possibilities for such a standardising move? If so, what was the result? If not, why not? 2. Is the Commission willing to investigate whether standardisation of this kind is possible? 3. Has a cost-benefit analysis already been carried out to evaluate the feasibility of such a move? If so, what was the result? If not, why not?
