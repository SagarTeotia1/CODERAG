9999/C Q999 E/051 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3613/03 by Camilo Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE) to the Council (26 November 2003) Subject: EU and Member State responsibility for the tragic deaths of immigrants on Europe's shores We only need to read our national dailies to be made aware of the daily tragedy of immigrants from Africa whose attempts to work and live in the EU result in their being imprisoned or dying in their hundreds off the EU's coast: 70 Somali immigrants drowned when attempting to reach Italy by boat ; small boat intercepted in Tarifa carrying 21 minors ; 141 immigrants arrested off Cadiz; arrested woman weeps ; 153 immigrants arrested on the southern Spanish coast ; the sea gives up the corpses of another 13 immigrants from the Rota shipwreck ; 34 dead already washed up of the 50 who were lost at sea in the preceding few days ; two Moroccan immigrants drowned when their boat sank at Tarifa ; two infants amongst the 81 illegal immigrants arrested in Tarifa ; 8590 immigrants arrested in Andalusia and the Canaries by mid-August . Meanwhile, the responsible and guilty European Union looks elsewhere and turns its back. What is the Council going to do about putting a stop to this appalling disgrace?
