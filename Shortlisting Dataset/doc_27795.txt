WRITTEN QUESTION E-1970/10 by Marielle De Sarnez (ALDE) to the Commission (6 April 2010) Subject: ‘Gruyère’ as a protected designation of origin (PDO) Both France and Switzerland have submitted applications to the Commission for registration of the name ‘Gruyère’ as a protected designation of origin (PDO). Protection of the designation ‘Gruyère’ in the framework of the EU‑Switzerland bilateral agreement, for the sole benefit of Swiss producers, could prevent the later registration of the French designation at Community level. This situation entails risks of distortions of competition which are likely to seriously disadvantage French producers of gruyère if only the Swiss ‘Gruyère’ designation were to be recognised on the Community market. Does the Commission intend to examine both the French and the Swiss applications for registration of the designation ‘Gruyère’ as a PDO simultaneously and attentively?
