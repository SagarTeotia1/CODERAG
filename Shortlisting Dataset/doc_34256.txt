16 December 2003 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION further to the European Council report and Commission statement pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure by Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit, Monica Frassoni and Nelly Maes on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group on the conclusions of the European Council of 12-13 December European Parliament resolution on the conclusions of the European Council of 12-13 December The European Parliament , – having regard to the Conclusions of the European Council held in Brussels on 12-13 December 2003, ECONOMIC GROWTH European action for growth 1. Criticises the European Council for having endorsed the ECOFIN report on the Growth Initiative without having given a strong political signal to embed this Initiative clearly into the Sustainability Strategy of the Union, as agreed in Gothenburg in 2001; wishes investments, and in particular those under the quick-start programmes, to be concentrated on projects aimed at decoupling transport growth from economic growth and resource use; 2. Does not see adequately reflected in the Growth Initiative the fact that investment in human capital, including for secondary education and life-long learning, is probably the most important single factor if Europe is to be able to cope with the challenges of the innovation-based global economy; 3. Rejects the view of the European Council that the Growth Initiative can be financed within the limits of the Stability and Growth Pact, as it was agreed in Amsterdam; criticises the Council for its lack of courage in addressing at the highest political level the open question of the future of the Stability Pact; invites the European Council to take the initiative of drafting a new pact coordinating the national budgets, to guarantee stability and sustainable growth and to penalise excessive deficits only during periods of growth; 4. Refers to the aforementioned Gothenburg Summit, where decoupling transport growth from economic growth was adopted as a basic principle for sustainable development; is doubtful about the consequences of the European Council's call on Member States to 'mobilise resources by bringing infrastructure assets to markets' and wishes clarification on the potential items covered by the proposed 'Securitisation Trusts' run by the EIB; emphasises that public assets cannot be financial guarantees for private business; calls for a critical evaluation of Public-Private Partnerships as regards consequences for 'ownership' and the 'hidden' long-term financial position of public budgets; calls for scrutiny of the impact of the new 'Community guarantee instrument for certain post-construction risks' in TEN-T on the Community budget and fair risk-sharing; 5. Underlines the need for priority to be given to rail and sustainable waterway infrastructure projects, in line with the modal shift vision of the Commission's 'White Paper on Transport Policy up to 2010', and calls for TEN-T priority projects to be limited to transborder, intermodal and sustainable projects; focuses furthermore on the necessity of a strategic environmental impact assessment on the TEN-T initiative, including its impact on CO2 emissions; 6. Is convinced that the European Parliament should express its detailed views on this new TEN-T initiative by complete application of the codecision procedure, starting with the first reading of this
