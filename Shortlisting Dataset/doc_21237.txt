Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (6 July 2007) According to Article 7 (3) of Directive 1999/2/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation OJ L 66, 13.3.1999. , the Member States shall forward to the Commission every year the results of checks carried out in the irradiation facilities and of checks carried out at the product marketing stage and the methods used to detect irradiated foods. On the basis of the data supplied, the Commission publishes a report. The reports, from September 2000 until 2004, are available in the Official Journal and on the website of the Commission Directorate-General ‘Health and Consumer Protection’ http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/biosafety/irradiation/index_en.htm . The report for the year 2005 has been finalised and will be published as soon as it is available in all Community languages. The Member States are currently submitting the information for the year 2006. The amounts of foodstuffs that are irradiated yearly in the EU vary between 14 000 and 20 000 tonnes. The largest food categories which are irradiated are spices and herbs, dried vegetables, frogs' legs, mechanically recovered chicken meat and seafood. The legislation does not require that the Member States inform the Commission about the quantities of irradiated food sold on the EU market. Each year, 5 000 to 7 000 food samples at the product marketing stage are checked. The amount of samples found irradiated has increased from 1.5 % in 2001 to 4 % in 2005. The increase may be due to the fact that Member States are organising more targeted controls. The vast majority of the foodstuffs that were found irradiated were not labelled as such. Products from Asia accounted for most of the non-compliant samples. The Members States have to ensure, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules OJ L 191, 28.5.2004. , that official controls are carried out regularly, risk based and with appropriate frequency. The Commission (Food and Veterinary Office) furthermore assesses the controls of the Member States on imports in relation to irradiation. In case shortcomings are identified, the Member States are requested to provide an action plan to resolve the deficiencies.
