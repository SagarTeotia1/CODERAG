Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (29 March 2011) Promoting entrepreneurship and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are among the Commission's key priorities since the adoption of the Small Business Act for Europe (SBA) in June 2008 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/small-business-act/index_en.htm and was strongly reaffirmed in the review of the SBA adopted in February 2011. The aim of the SBA is to create a favourable business environment for SMEs by creating a common framework for SME- and entrepreneurship-related actions at European and national level and by putting the ‘Think small first’ principle into practice. The Commission therefore promotes the wide use of the ‘SME Test’ in its impact assessment procedure in order to evaluate the impact of forthcoming legislative and policy initiatives on SMEs. Member States are invited, for their part, to create a more SME-friendly business environment in start-up and bankruptcy procedures and to track their progress in these two areas. Several initiatives to promote entrepreneurship have been launched. These include the European SME Week, the European Enterprise Awards, the launch of the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors and the programme ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’. The objectives of these actions are to promote entrepreneurship among the general public, reward SME-friendly policies taken at regional/local level, foster the exchange of good practices between Member States' administrations, increase the number of women starting businesses, encourage the creation of new SMEs, and promote skills and capacity building, exchange of experience and development of new business contacts/opportunities between entrepreneurs all over Europe. To improve access to finance for SMEs, the Commission will continue to use all available tools, including the financial instruments provided under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/finance/cip-financial-instruments/index_en.htm More information on what is available in Romania here: http://www.access2finance.eu/ro/Romania/what_is_available.htm . The SME finance forum, held for the first time in May 2010, will provide a permanent forum to monitor the market situation and to encourage new approaches to improve access to finance for SMEs. Finally, the Commission provides local support to SMEs thanks to the Enterprise Europe Network http://www.enterprise-europe-network.ec.europa.eu/about/branches/ro/ : the network comprises 600 partner organisations located all over the EU (and beyond). It offers a wide range of services to SMEs including information on EU legislation, matchmaking events to help SMEs find business or innovation partners in other countries and advice on how to participate in EU funding programmes, such as FP7.
