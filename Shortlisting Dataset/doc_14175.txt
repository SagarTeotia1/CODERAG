Deplores the fact that most of the programmes where the Commission is forecasting about 10% divergence from the budgetary authority's decision, in terms of commitments or payments, represent political priorities for Parliament (e-learning, information and communication, social dimension and employment, justice and home affairs, cooperation with Latin America, cooperation measures, etc.); calls on the Commission to give more detailed reasons for this failure to implement and to take the necessary action with due regard for Article 26 of the Financial Regulation and the budgetary authority's decisions; 26. Notes that, as at 6 May 2002, total outstanding commitments were € 110.447 billion, or more than the annual budget of the European Union; 27. Notes that 624 items with outstanding commitments were examined between 1 January and 30 April 2002, representing 25% of total items pending and € 147 million in payment appropriations; welcomes the fact that the Commission has cancelled € 97 million of 'potentially abnormal' commitments totalling € 3.5 billion; calls on the Commission to draw up a plan, modelled on the implementation plan, to clear these abnormal outstanding commitments; Heading 1 28. Points out that, according to the latest Early Warning System report (No 5/2002) on expenditure in the EAGGF Guarantee Section, the uptake of appropriations under subheading 1a (market support) was EUR 1 592.4 million below the indicator in May 2002, whereas the implementation of subheading 1b (rural development) was proceeding as foreseen; believes that such a discrepancy cannot be attributed only to delays in payments and calls on the Commission to investigate the reasons and make known its conclusions so that, if structural shortcomings are the cause, they are taken into account when the Commission presents the mid-term review of Agenda 2000; Heading 2 29. Notes that the rate of payment implementation, which was already poor at the close of the financial year 2000, has deteriorated further, amounting to no more than 67.9% of payment appropriations at 31 December 2001 and only 14% at 6 May 2002, down by half over the same date in the previous year (27%); 30. Voices its concern at the increasing volume of outstanding commitments, which rose from € 38 418 million to € 56 765 million between 1 January and 31 December 2001 and totalled € 82 710 million as at 6 May 2002; 31. Points out that speeding up implementation is an abiding concern of the budgetary authority and one of the increasing objectives of revising the rules on the Structural Funds; stresses the importance of introducing new project management systems geared to best practice and procedural simplification; calls for the application, authorisation and payment procedures to be reviewed for unnecessary rigidity and obstacles, and for proposals for simplification to be made; 32. Presses for the development and use, without delay, of new control instruments in order to ensure effective quarterly monitoring and thus improve implementation of structural operations: surveillance and early warning indicators and performance indicators for an assessment of economic, social and environmental impact on beneficiary regions; 33. Urges the Commission by 30 September 2002 to provide, on the basis
