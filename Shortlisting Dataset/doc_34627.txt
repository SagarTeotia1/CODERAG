Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (25 March 2009) The Commission recognises the importance of efforts aiming at ensuring a sustainable healthcare and social protection system in France. The Commission understands that the Law No 2008‑1330 of 17 December 2008 on the financing of social security increased the health insurance related turnover tax rate. The Commission also understands that the purpose of this tax is to finance the so-called complementary universal health cover. This cover forms a part of the French statutory social security. Its aim is to provide low-earners with a one year complementary cover. The Commission does not believe that the introduction of a tax to be paid by all complementary health insurance undertakings creates a market distortion. Member States are free to determine the benefits provided by their own social security systems and the way these systems are financed as long as they adhere to the basic principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination.
