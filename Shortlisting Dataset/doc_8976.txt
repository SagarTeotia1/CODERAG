ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0004/09 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Guido Sacconi , on behalf of the PSE Group to the Commission Subject: Impact of the financial crisis on the car industry The current financial and economic crisis is generally hitting the European economy, and in particular sectors such as the car industry and its subcontractors, which are feeling the effects of the crisis at an economic, social and employment level and are already affected by large-scale dismissals and redundancy payments. On 26 November 2008 the European Commission launched a package of measures asking Member States and other EU institutions such as the EIB and the EBRD to support a new industrial deal for the EU economy at this difficult time by improving energy efficiency and sustaining employment levels. The achievement of the legislative measures in the climate-energy package adopted in December could play a fundamental role in promoting green and energy-saving investments in the car industry sector as well as in other relevant sectors, with undoubted benefits to the related sectors. How does the Commission intend to reinforce coordinated intervention by all Member States which provides for incentives for the car industry sector and its satellites linked to innovation policies and reductions of CO2 emissions ? Does the Commission consider it necessary to urge Member States to implement and update their internal procedures in order to make the European Social Fund more flexible, effective and capable of responding promptly to crisis situations? Does the Commission consider it necessary to revise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), given the economic and social impact of the current situation, in order to ensure cohesion policies within the EU?
