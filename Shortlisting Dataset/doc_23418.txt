where action on a Community-wide basis is considered necessary beyond any measure already in place to address an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment arising from the manufacture, use or placing on the market of substances, a Member state or the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) upon request of the Commission, may prepare a restriction dossier in accordance with Annex XV of REACH. Substances identified being of very high concern (SVHC) in accordance with the procedure set up in Article 59 of REACH may also be subject to the Authorisation procedure. In this context, the three phthalates DEHP, BBP and DBP have been identified as Substances of Very High Concern and included in the first list of substances candidate for inclusion in Annex XIV (‘Authorisation List’) published by the Chemicals Agency on 28 October 2008. These three substances have also been included in the first draft recommendation of substances to be included in the Authorisation list prepared by the ECHA, which is currently subject to public consultation. Interested parties can submit comments until 14 April 2009 http://echa.europa.eu/consultations/authorisation/draft_recommendations_en.asp .
