ensure global food security are dual challenges which need to be pursued together; stresses that the need, on the one hand, to expand production and the need, on the other hand, to increase the sequestration of carbon in soil and biomass must not lead to a conflict of goals; 8. Notes that an internationally concerted approach towards a global climate agreement is needed, so as to ensure a level playing field with agricultural sectors in other economies; 9. Recalls that improved agricultural and forestry practices should increase the sector’s capacity to preserve and sequester carbon in soils and forests; stresses at the same time that most forest owners are also farmers; stresses, furthermore, the EU’s goal of curbing the deforestation occurring worldwide, in particular in developing countries, and of halting global forest cover loss by 2030 at the latest; 10. Emphasises the importance of developing suitable measures and/or mechanisms that enable real financial recognition of the role played by agriculture and forestry in conserving carbon; 11. Stresses that the Commission should emphasise climate mainstreaming to create coherence between policies, such as industry, research, energy, biodiversity, trade, development, agriculture, innovation, transport, animal welfare and the Europe 2020 strategy; sound and strategic management of the agricultural sector’s potential would put Europe well on its way to becoming a competitive player in tomorrow’s low-carbon global economy; 12. Calls for the necessary measures, including research funding, education efforts, investment aid and other incentive-based initiatives, in the CAP that would support and enable the use of agricultural and forestry residue in the production of sustainable energy; 13. Calls for the CAP to include targets for the use of sustainable energy; 14 Stresses that the food chain should be shorter and transparent and that the consumption of locally produced food should be encouraged, including support for local and regional markets, in order to reduce agricultural production’s transport-related emissions; stresses that relocating European multifunctional production and processing to non-EU countries would have a negative impact on European added value and on climate goals; 15. Deplores the fact that too much agricultural waste is currently not used to its full potential; considers that agricultural waste should be seen as an asset; calls on the Commission and the Member States to put forward national strategies on the need for better management of bio-waste and of agricultural and forestry by-products; notes in this respect the use of animal waste and plant-based by-products and processing waste e.g. in biofermenters, to produce on-farm energy while at the same time also reducing farmers’ production costs; 16. Notes that, with the knowledge and techniques available today, agricultural holdings may already become self-sufficient in energy with the possibility of both increasing profitability and creating environmental gains through the local production of bioenergy from organic waste; 17. Notes that, for reasons of resource efficiency, farmers should be encouraged to make better use of the potential of biogas and biogas by-products to replace fertilisers; 18. Notes that biofuels have a key role to play in the long‑term strategy to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources; calls for greater
