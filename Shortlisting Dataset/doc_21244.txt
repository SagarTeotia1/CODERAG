the quality of energy saving and efficiency; 41. Calls on the Commission, when promoting energy efficiency, to establish specific measures in order to tackle the reverse incentives that occur between the consumers and the distributors of energy; 42. Calls on the Commission to introduce a long-term target for the reduction of energy consumption of the EU building stock by 2050; 43. Draws attention to the fact that the EU and the Member States have not invested sufficiently in measures to reduce CO 2 emissions or to increase energy efficiency in the fields of construction and transport; calls on the Commission and the Member States to allocate increased funding to measures to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and of centralised urban heating and cooling networks, both in the context of the review of the current Financial Perspective and under future Multiannual Financial Frameworks; Renewable e nergy 44. Calls on the Commission to develop a biomass supply policy to encourage sustainable biomass production and use; emphasises that this should include sustainability criteria for different biomass taking into account lifecycle carbon profiles of different sources, with priority being given to securing first value from biomass raw materials rather than their use for energy; insists that meeting the EU’s biofuels target must not adversely affect food and feed production or lead to a loss of biodiversity; 45. Calls, therefore, on the Commission to introduce indirect land use change (ILUC) factors in order to take account of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to changes in land use patterns caused by biofuels production; highlights that increasing greenhouse gas saving thresholds for biofuels would not address the risks of ILUC; 46. Emphasises the importance of new technologies in the development of renewable energies and the production of bioenergy, and stresses that the EU needs to harness every available innovation in order to achieve its objectives for the reduction of CO 2 emissions; 47. Underlines the important role of renewable energy, including innovative developments in this field, and the urgent need for better solutions as regards storage, increasing energy efficiency and ensuring efficient energy transmission, including appropriate infrastructure measures; recognises the significant progress achieved by Member States in the development of renewable sources of energy since binding targets were set for 2020; draws attention to the importance of continuing this approach and setting further binding renewable energy targets for 2030, taking into account the possibility and macroeconomic impact of doing so; points out that such action will help achieve the 2050 objectives, give industry the investment certainty it requires, significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create employment, promote the EU’s energy independence, and foster technological leadership and industrial innovation; stresses that meeting the targets set in the national renewable energy action plans is crucial for the achievement of the overall EU targets for 2050; considers that the Commission should take measures if national targets are not met; 48. Stresses the need for the Commission to ensure that adoption of such targets does not reduce the incentives for investment in other forms of low-carbon power generation; 49. Calls on the Commission,
