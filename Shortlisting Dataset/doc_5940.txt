Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (13 February 2009) The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for drawing its attention to this issue. The Commission can not confirm the accuracy of the information provided. The Commission does not have contacts with Hamas, which is on the EU list of terrorist organisations. The European Union is concerned by the reported intolerance and repression that Christians, as well as other religious minorities, are facing in many countries of the world. The Commission strongly condemns discrimination on the ground of religion or belief, or any other ground. The European Union takes action at the United Nations (UN) level on the issue of religious freedom, and introduced to the 63rd session of the UN General Assembly its customary resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance based on religion or belief. The Commission also supports the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Ms Asma Jahangir.
