Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (30 October 2008) The responsibility for controls in organic farming lies with the Member States. According to Article 9 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 OJ L 198, 22.7. 1991. , Member States shall set up an inspection system operated by one or more designated inspection authorities and/or by approved private bodies. Annex III of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 stipulates that the inspection body or authority must make a full physical inspection, at least once a year, of all organic operators. The new Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 OJ L 189, 20.7.2007. , replacing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 as of 1 January 2009, maintains the same requirements. The Commission is responsible for supervision of the control systems set up by the Member States. Based on the supervision reports that each Member State is obliged to submit to the Commission according to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, the Commission prepares and publishes annually a report on the supervision of inspection bodies and authorities of the Member States. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official food and feed controls (OFFC) mentions the organic farming regulation and applies from 1 January 2006. This means that organic farming is integrated into the OFFC framework. In this context, Member States have to prepare multi-annual national control plans (Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 OJ L 191, 28.5.2004. ) and annually report on their implementation (Article 44 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004). The implementation of the control plans is subject to audits of the Commission (DG SANCO Directorate-General for Health and Consumers. ).
