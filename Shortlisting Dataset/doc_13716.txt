WRITTEN QUESTION E-1171/07 by Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven (Verts/ALE) and David Hammerstein Mintz (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (8 March 2007) Subject: Emine coastal headland At the end of 2006 the Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Water dropped important sites from the list that will be proposed for inclusion in the Natura 2000 programme. These sites are located in the Rhodope Mountains, Balkan Mountain, Rila Mountain, Sakar Mountain, Sredna Gora Mountain, Strandja Mountain, Dobrudja region and the border regions at the borders with Serbia and FYROM. This was a scandalous step, because it concerns sites of great Natura 2000 value. On 15 February 2007 the Government of Bulgaria excluded from the Natura 2000 list many of the country's most famous wilderness areas. One of them is Emine coastal headland. Emine is a coastal headland formed where the easternmost point of the Stara Planina mountains meets the Black Sea. The coast is rocky, with vertical cliffs, dry grassland, Paliurus scrub, and sparse stands of secondary Quercus forest. The headland is a major migratory bottleneck site, where huge numbers of soaring waterbirds and raptors pass overhead in autumn, especially Ciconia ciconia (92,272-172,928 per season during 1990‑96). It is also one of the most important breeding areas for Hippolais olivetorum in Bulgaria. In view of this how will the Commission ensure fulfilment of Bulgaria’s obligations with respect to Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 . , and more particularly will the Commission undertake infringement proceedings against Bulgaria as soon as possible?
