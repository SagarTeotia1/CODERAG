ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0052/05 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Giuseppe Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs to the Council Subject: Regulation on the Community Patent and related legislation Given that the creation of a Community patent would enable undertakings to adapt their production and distribution activities to the European dimension, which is considered to be an essential tool, if the EU is to succeed in turning research results into industrial and commercial success, Given that the Committee on Legal Affairs considers that adequate protection of inventive ideas is necessary if the Union wishes to attain the Lisbon objectives, and that, in this field, the Draft Regulation on the Community Patent, together with all its subsequent legislation, especially the Council decision establishing a Court on the Community patent, is of paramount importance, Given that the draft regulation of the Community patent, as well as certain related legislative acts, have been blocked in the Council for more than two years, Could the Council fully and openly inform Parliament about the main obstacles and problems which are preventing an agreement being reached on the Community Patent, especially those concerning the language regime of the Community patent? Could the Council inform Parliament about the measures that it intends to take so as to facilitate the adoption of this important piece of legislation?
