Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (1 September 2011) A fully functioning single market depends on modern, high performing infrastructure connecting Europe particularly in the area of transport, energy and information and communication technology. Through their growth-enhancing connections, the Trans-European Networks (TEN) will provide better access to the single market and notably allow connecting island, landlocked and peripheral Member States with the central regions of the Union, as required by the Lisbon Treaty. The Connecting Europe Facility will aim at completing the transport ‘core network’, the energy ‘priority corridors’ and the digital infrastructure that the EU needs for its future sustainable competitiveness. It will support infrastructures with a European and single market dimension, targeting EU support on priority networks that must be implemented to reach the EU's 2020 energy and climate targets and where European action is most warranted. Given the increasing complexity of networks, the effective coordination which will minimise the costs for all citizens can only be achieved at the European level. The implementation procedures relating to the Connecting Europe Facility will be set out in a Commission proposal for a Parliament and Council regulation planned for October 2011. This regulation will, once adopted, replace the existing TEN financing regulation, but remains without prejudice to projects having received funding under the existing regulation.
