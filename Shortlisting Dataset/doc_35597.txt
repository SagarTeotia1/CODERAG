ORAL QUESTION H-0187/03 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Mark Watts to the Commission Subject: Slaughter of baby seal pups in the White Sea, Russia In its reply to my previous question ( H-0046/03 ), the Commission invited me to provide ‘concrete and reliable information’ confirming that the Russian authorities are heavily subsidising the killing of baby seal pups on the White Sea. Will the Commission please note that I have now supplied this information to the Commission, in written form, accompanied by video evidence of the bloody slaughter itself. It is abundantly clear that the Russians are subsidising this outrageous activity by means of free fish quotas. In its previous answer, the Commission promised that it would raise the matter of the killing of baby seals with the Russian authorities in the Subcommittee on Environment under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, and stated that it was hoped that the next meeting of this Subcommittee would be held at the end of March or the beginning of April. Will the Commission please now state precisely when the meeting will be held? Written answer, 11.2.2003
