Debate : 19.04.2004 Vote: 20.04.2004 Vote The European Parliament adopted at first reading clear targets for recycling of batteries and accumulators throughout the EU. After a lengthy voting session the Parliament stood by its rapporteur Hans BLOKLAND (EDD, NL) and adopted stricker limits for both recycling and recovery of used batteries and accumulators EU-wide. It is now for the Council to have its say - according to codecision. MEPs are demanding a collection rate of 50% of the national annual sales of portable batteries instead of a figure of 160 grams per inhabitant per year as proposed by the Commission, which would in practice have meant a collection rate of 40%. The Parliament says the collection targets should be amended to percentage targets in order to better reflect the level of consumption, which varies throughout the EU. Parliament also wants to limit the use of cadmium, lead and mercury in batteries wherever possible. It is therefore calling for governments to prohibit sales of all batteries or accumulators containing more than 5 parts per million (ppm) of mercury by weight, 40 ppm of lead, and/or 20 ppm of cadmium. A list of exemptions will be provided for applications where the use of these heavy metals is unavoidable - in other words, where no substitutes exist. But MEPs say the list should be reviewed to ensure that it keeps up with latest technological developments, for example if the use of these metals becomes avoidable through the emergence of alternatives. Batteries are used in a wide variety of products and appliances for consumers and professionals. Generally, the battery and accumulator market is divided into portable batteries (usually weigh less than 1 kg) and industrial and automotive batteries (usually weighing more than 1 kg). Each year, approximately 800.000 tonnes of automotive batteries, 190.000 tonnes of industrial batteries and 160.000 tonnes of portable batteries are sold throughout Europe. Non-rechargeable portable batteries represent the largest proportion of the portable battery market, approximately 72% in 2002.
