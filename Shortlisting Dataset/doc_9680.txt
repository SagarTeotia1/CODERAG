Question for written answer E-006640/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Vasilica Viorica Dăncilă (S&D) (13 July 2011) Subject: Crossborder sporting activities According to WHO data, the world's fourth biggest mortality risk is a sedentary lifestyle. In Europe, failure to take exercise or practise any kind of sport is leading to an alarming rise in obesity, especially among young people. The number of obese children is rising at the rate of some 400 000 each year, while more than 14 million adults suffer from obesity. The WHO considers that the main cause of obesity in young people is not diet but the lack of any kind of physical activity, even outside school. It remains the case that sports, including sporting activity outside school, can make a major contribution to the integration of children and adolescents from immigrant groups and of those with reduced mobility. What measures will the Commission take to support efforts by the authorities concerned to develop new sporting facilities, especially in rural areas, with a view to encouraging sport for people of all ages? In what ways will it contribute to the development of crossborder sporting facilities for schools which are not located near existing sports centres with which they could cooperate or are situated in remote areas?
