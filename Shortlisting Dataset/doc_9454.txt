ORAL QUESTION H-0030/08 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Bogusław Sonik to the Commission Subject: Legislation on reducing odour nuisance in the EU The adverse effect of odorous substances on the environment and on people is a concern increasingly raised by EU citizens. Some EU countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, have experimented with specific legislation on odour reduction problems. Other countries, however, have failed to take such action, blaming the lack of appropriate options at Community level. Does the Commission intend to take any steps to regulate quality standards for atmospheric odours in the European Union and or to use other legal means to tackle the problem of reducing odour nuisance? If so, what progress has been made with these provisions and when will they be introduced?
