Justification It needs to be clarified that it is about the employees' rights. Amendment 10 Proposal for a regulation Article 2 – paragraph 1 – point b Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (b) 'distribution' means any financial benefit derived directly or indirectly from the SPE by a shareholder, in relation to the shares held by him, including any transfer of money or property, as well as the incurring of a debt; (b) 'distribution' means any financial benefit derived directly or indirectly from the SPE by a shareholder, in relation to the shares held by him, including any transfer of money or property, as well as the incurring of a debt that is not balanced by a full c laim to compensation or reimbursement ; Justification Clarification.
