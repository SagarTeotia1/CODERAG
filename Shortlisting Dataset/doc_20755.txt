Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (21 February 2012) In line with the proposed regulation on guidelines for TEN‑E infrastructure, a Project of Common Interest could receive Union financial assistance in the form of a grant (co-financing) if it has significant positive externalities but lacks commercial viability. In the field of gas, the regulation focuses on transmission, storage facilities and reception of liquefied/compressed natural gas. Gas production infrastructure is not covered by the scope of the regulation. Being covered by the Southern Gas Corridor, which is identified as a priority corridor in the annex I of the proposed regulation, Cyprus will be involved in the process of identification of concrete projects that would be considered as best placed to contribute to the diversification of gas supply.
