teenage drinking and smoking pose especially serious public health concerns. - a new category of travellers, along with air travellers, private pleasure-flying, frontier zone workers, should be introduced. Namely, the sea ferry and cruise travellers who are travelling on maritime journeys of a certain duration and distance; the exact required distance of sea travel is debatable and could be set at 50 or 100 km to exclude short sea hops which would be open to abuse and lose significant revenues to some Member States. - the Rapporteur appreciates the concerns of some of the new EU Member States that share land borders with third countries, very often with significantly lower retail prices, and are therefore exposed to intensified cross-border one way trade of those cheaper products. However, he believes that the proposed monetary thresholds for air and sea ferry/cruise travellers on import of goods other than tobacco products and alcohol beverages are set too low and should be increased substantially; the threshold for land crossings although lower than air and sea could also be moderately increased. It is also a fact that helping neighbouring economies to the East through increased trade is in many ways more useful than aid money from the ENPI from the EU general budget. - as far as the inhabitants of the so-called frontier zones are concerned and the Commission's proposal to allow Member States application of lower monetary and quantitative thresholds, the Rapporteur is of an opinion that by choosing their place of residence near Community borders the citizens should not be treated any differently from any other ones. He therefore suggests deletion of those respective provisions and to reinforce national customs powers to confiscate and to fine those citizens including frontier zone residents abusing the allowance exemptions for commercial purposes.
