ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0083/05 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Giles Chichester and Etelka Barsi-Pataky , on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to the Commission Subject: Digital switchover The transition from analogue to digital broadcasting will bring benefits at all level. It also forms part of the Lisbon Agenda, which highlights the importance of spectrum availability to boost innovation in ICT. The Commission proposes 2012 as a common target date for switching off analogue terrestrial broadcasting and, with a view to the Regional Radiocommunication Conference and the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2006 and 2007 respectively, calls for the flexible use of the former analogue bands. What is the Commission's opinion: is the 2012 switch-off date feasible? Can we be sure that, close to the target switch-off date interference from analogue channels transmitting from outside the European Union will be eliminated? How must the RRC planning approach be presented in order to maintain a balance with the common market and policy development? Will the Commission play a leading role in initiating the research and development relating to new and innovative services other than broadcasting at a pan-European level?
