Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2007) The Commission is not informed on the details of the American project mentioned by the Honourable Member. However, it is aware that, for the safety of modern aviation, the management of the electromagnetic spectrum and of the frequency channels is becoming increasingly important. Nowadays, at worldwide level, spectrum allocations are dealt with by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), where the aviation interests are represented through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as an accredited observer. The ITU Regulations are applied also by the United States. In Europe, strong coordination mechanisms exist between the Commission and the European Conference of Postal & Telecommunications Administration (CEPT), on the basis of Decision No 676/2002/EC Decision No 676/2002/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision), OJ L 108, 24.4.2002. , which, inter alia , emphasises the safety, health and public interest aspects linked to the exploitation of the electro-magnetic spectrum. The Commission will therefore continue to coordinate the use of electromagnetic spectrum, also in order to protect safety of transport or of other critical applications, at Community scale, using the established mechanisms for proper coordination with the Member States. At operational level, all signals in space used for safety of life applications in aviation are continuously monitored and appropriate fall-back procedures do exist to mitigate unforeseen interferences.
