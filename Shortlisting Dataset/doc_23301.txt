WRITTEN QUESTION E-4575/08 by Jim Higgins (PPE-DE) to the Commission (11 August 2008) Subject: A balanced approach to alcohol advertising aimed at young people Will the Commission consider reforming anti-drinking campaigns that target the effects of young people's over-consumption of alcohol, as these adverts imply a penalty of social disapproval? A more balanced approach should be favoured, highlighting not just the short-term effects of alcohol consumption but also the long-term effects as well.
