Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (19 August 2010) The Commission fully adheres to the judgment of the Court of Justice of 7 September 2004 in Case C‑262/03 and considers that the precautionary principle, as laid down in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and in the preamble of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), has to be taken into account in the application of Article 6 Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7. (the Habitats Directive). However, the Habitats directive allows the authorisation of plans or projects where there is no evidence of significant adverse effects or, subject to the conditions laid down in Article 6.4, where compensation measures to offset such effects are adopted.
