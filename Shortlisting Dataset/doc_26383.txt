WRITTEN QUESTION E-4163/05 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (11 November 2005) Subject: Situation of Maral Yklymova On 25 November 2002 an armed attack took place on President Niyazov of Turkmenistan, which triggered a wave of increased oppression against Turkmen citizens. Many of them were targeted simply on the grounds of being related to regime critics. One of these is Maral Yklymova, daughter of Sapar Yklymov, who has links to the Turkmen opposition. Sapar Yklymov sought political asylum in 1994 and is currently living in Sweden. After studying in London, Maral Yklymova returned to Turkmenistan to work, but in connection with the attack she lost her job and was arrested and held for several days. She also had her flat, her personal belongings and her passport confiscated. Since then she has been living under constant surveillance in what appears to be illegal house arrest by the Turkmen security forces, and her contacts with the outside world were completely cut off about a year ago. She has been granted asylum in Sweden, but is not permitted to leave the country. Organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have issued a joint appeal calling for the President to release those arrested arbitrarily or illegally, for prisoners to be permitted to receive visitors, and for those arrested in connection with the 2002 attack to be given a proper trial. Most recently, on 11 October 2005, Kofi Annan expressed concern at the serious violations of human rights in Turkmenistan. What pressure does the Commission propose to exert so that Maral Yklymova can leave Turkmenistan and rejoin her family in Sweden?
