WRITTEN QUESTION E-1388/08 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (12 March 2008) Subject: EU funding for environmentally harmful projects According to an article in the EU Observer of 25 February 2008, two NGOs have drawn attention to the EU's funding of environmentally harmful projects. In their report on over 50 projects in central and eastern Europe presented on Monday 25 February 2008 by Friends of the Earth Europe and CEE Bankwatch Network, the examples given include a project aimed at promoting the use of waste incinerators rather than recycling, projects for motorways that will run through valuable natural areas regardless of possible alternative routes, and water management projects that will harm rivers and other natural sites. The projects are in the EU Member States of Estonia, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria, as well as EU candidates Croatia and Macedonia. The total cost is some EUR 22 billion. 1. How does the Commission view these projects? 2. Will the Commission take measures to investigate or make changes to the projects? If so, what measures? If not, why not?
