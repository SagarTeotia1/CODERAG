WRITTEN QUESTION E-2819/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (27 July 2005) Subject: Plaka bridge The single-arched bridge of Plaka, at Raftanei in the Tzoumerka mountains (province of Ioannina), is in danger of collapsing. Built in 1866, this is the largest single-arched bridge in the Balkans. It is a unique example of secular architecture and is classed as a historical monument. There is a significant risk of collapse, since cracks have appeared at the base of the bridge. Given that this is one of the very few bridges remaining in the area, can the Commission say how it might contribute to preserving and restoring this part of our cultural heritage? Under what specific programmes would it be possible to apply for funding to restore this monument?
