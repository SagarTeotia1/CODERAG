relationships; believes that many forms of atypical employment relationship represent important ways for carers, students and others who rely on short-term contracts and part-time work, for example, to earn extra income; emphasises that it is vital that workers in atypical employment relationships should have minimum rights and be protected against exploitation; 9. Encourages Member States to promote transitions into productive and rewarding high-quality jobs and to develop labour law provisions that effectively safeguard the rights of people who are employed in atypical forms of work, ensuring equal treatment with workers with full-time standard contracts on the basis of the maximum level of worker protection; 10. Recommends that workers on atypical contracts be covered by existing EU directives that cover worker categories within the EU, including the Working Time Directive(93/104/EC), the directive on temporary agency work(2008/104/EC), the directive on part-time work (97/81/EC) and the Council Directive concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work (1999/70/EC); 11. Notes that the trend towards an increase in the proportion of non-standard or atypical contracts has a strong gender and intergenerational dimension, as women, older and younger workers are disproportionately represented in non-standard employment; notes that some sectors experience rapid structural changes; calls on the Member States and the Commission to investigate the reasons for this trend, to take appropriate, targeted measures in the relevant areas to combat this imbalance, by facilitating the transition towards permanent employment and, in particular, by promoting measures to enable both men and women to reconcile work, family and private life, through a greater focus on social dialogue with worker representatives in companies, and to monitor and publicise the success of these measures; calls, further, on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that the recourse to non-standard or atypical contracts does not serve to conceal illicit employment, but rather to promote, via the exchange of skills, the transition of young people and the unemployed towards effective integration in the labour market by providing employees and companies with a context of security and flexibility that strengthens both employability and competitiveness; 12. Calls on the Member States to ensure the more effective implementation of Directive 97/81/EC on part-time work and Directive 1999/70/EC on fixed-term work having regard in particular to the fundamental principle of non discrimination; stresses the importance of training and lifelong learning in facilitating job transitions, which is especially important for fixed term workers; 13. Stresses that recourse to atypical forms of employment should be a personal choice and not an imposition dictated by increasing barriers to labour market access for certain groups or the lack of high-quality jobs; notes that, in particular for multiply disadvantaged workers, individually tailored atypical contracts provided by work integration social enterprises may be a choice as they offer a first stepping stone into employment; 14. Welcomes the adoption of Directive 2008/104/EC on agency work and calls for its swift implementation; 15. Notes that atypical forms of employment must contractually provide workers with a course of training, and stresses that non-standard forms of work can, if they are properly protected and include support in the area
