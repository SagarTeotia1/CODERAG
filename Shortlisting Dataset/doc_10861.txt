Reply (2 June 2008) The Euromed Audiovisual Programme aims at encouraging the emergence of a common Euro‑Mediterranean awareness and vision based on mutual respect, understanding and cultural diversity. It is intended as a platform for pursuing an effective peace prospect on both shores of the Mediterranean. The Conference of the Ministers of Culture of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, which will be held in Athens on 29‑30 May 2008, will discuss the working paper ‘Towards a Strategy for the Development of Euro-Mediterranean Audiovisual Cooperation’ that has been drawn up by a reflection group composed of European and Mediterranean professionals and institutions, which was created in order to define future common policies in the field of audiovisual cooperation. Council has already adopted Draft guidelines in preparation for the Conclusions of this meeting (14 April 2008) to be brought into the line with the Mediterranean partners. The document recognises abovementioned Strategy as an important tool for structuring audiovisual policies and endorses the priorities developed in that paper. Given the contribution of the Euromed Audiovisual Programme in fostering intercultural dialogue, the Conference of the Ministers of Culture will also examine further concrete steps in order to ensure the continuation of the activities in this field.
