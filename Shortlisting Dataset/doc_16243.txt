to the farming sector, to public infrastructure and private assets, to transport networks and to cultural heritage sites. The Polish authorities estimated the total direct damage at EUR 2 998 989 248. This amount represents 0,8468 % of Poland's Gross National Income (GNI). As the estimated total direct damage exceeds the normal threshold for mobilising the Solidarity Fund of EUR 2.124 billion (i.e. 0,6 % of GNI based on 2008 data) the disaster qualifies as a “major natural disaster” and falls thus within the main field of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002. Slovakia applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after in May and June 2010 the central and eastern parts of Slovakia were hit by record heavy rainfall. Areas were drenched, slopes slid and the wide-spread flooding caused severe damage to public and private infrastructure, to road and train networks, agriculture and businesses. The Slovak authorities estimated the total direct damage at EUR 561 133 594. This amount represents 0,8902 % of Slovakia's GNI. As the estimated total direct damage exceeds the normal threshold for mobilising the Solidarity Fund applicable to Slovakia in 2010 of EUR 378.205 million (i.e. 0,6 % of GNI based on 2008 data) the disaster qualifies as a “major natural disaster” and falls thus within the main field of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002. Hungary applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund following one month of near-continuous rainfall in May and June 2010 leading to severe flooding causing widespread damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, to the road network and other infrastructure with the north-eastern and central parts of the country being particularly badly affected. The Hungarian authorities estimated the total direct damage at EUR 719 343 706. This amount represents 0,7307 % of Hungary's GNI. As the estimated total direct damage exceeds the normal threshold for mobilising the Solidarity Fund applicable to Hungary in 2010 of EUR 590.710 million (i.e. 0,6 % of GNI based on 2008 data) the disaster qualifies as a “major natural disaster” and falls thus within the main field of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002. The Czech Republic applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after its territory was hit by severe torrential rains during May and June 2010. These rains resulted in two interconnected waves of floods which affected the North-Eastern part of the territory causing damages to residential properties and businesses, to the road network and other infrastructure. The Czech authorities estimated the total direct damage caused by the disaster at EUR 204 456 041. As this amount is below the threshold of EUR 824.029 million (i.e. 0,6 % of the Czech Republic's GNI) the disaster does not qualify as a “major natural disaster” under the terms of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002. However, the Czech Republic was affected by the same flooding disaster which led to the major disaster in Poland and Slovakia. Therefore, the condition set out in Article 2(2) second subparagraph of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, whereby a country affected by the same major disaster as a
