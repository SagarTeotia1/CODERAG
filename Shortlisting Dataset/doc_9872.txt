Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (2 February 2007) The Commission is increasingly worried about the security situation in many parts of Iraq. It is clear that the sectarian violence has become an every day occurrence. Many individuals, families and groups are seeking shelter by leaving their homes for peace and safety in other parts of the country or in neighbouring countries. The high numbers of internally and externally displaced people may have an effect on the social and ethnic fabric of the country. The Commission is aware of the situation of the Assyrian Christians and other religious minorities in Iraq. We attach great importance to the freedom of religion, belief and expression and to the rights of people belonging to minorities, and raise these issues regularly in the political dialogue with the Iraqi government. The Commission is supporting the EU line of a unified Iraq. This is reflected in our work across various sectors. In the Community financial aid to Iraqi reconstruction substantial emphasis has been given to the political process and democratization. Within this field support was given to the constitutional process in 2005. The current text of the constitution is open for a review that is ongoing through the parliamentary committee set up for this purpose. This is the democratic forum established for looking at issues related to a number of areas including rights and status of the communities and minorities. The Commission has conveyed its willingness to provide further assistance to Iraq in this process.
