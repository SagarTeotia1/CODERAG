Question for written answer E-005111/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (24 May 2011) Subject: Costs of ‘Western’ and ‘non-Western’ immigrants Calculations have been made in Denmark on the financial impact of amendments to its immigration law. These calculations also revealed the nature of the economic relationship between ‘Western’ and ‘non-Western’ immigrants. Whilst ‘Western’ immigrants contribute EUR 300 million each year to the State, the cost to the State of ‘non-Western’ immigrants from other cultures is EUR 2.1 billion per year. 1. Does the Commission know of the results of these calculations? 2. Are there similar calculations at EU level on the costs of immigration? 3. In view of these results, what is the Commission’s position on the arguments put forward by those who advocate immigration that the EU needs immigration (for economic reasons)?
