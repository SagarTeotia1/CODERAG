2004/C 70 E/197 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2999/03 by Olivier Duhamel (PSE) to the Commission (14 October 2003) Subject: Information brochure The Commission has recently published an information brochure entitled Panorama of the European Union . Curiously to relate, this brief history of the European Union makes judicious reference to Robert Schuman and the 9 May 1950 speech from which today's Union grew, but it includes no mention of Jean Monnet. All those involved at the time, and all historical research into the subject, show that Monnet was the inspirer of the Schuman Declaration. How does the Commission explain this oversight? Does it agree that a word in tribute to the original courage of the one in no way diminishes the courage of the other?
