WRITTEN QUESTION E-0605/10 by Ivo Belet (PPE) to the Commission (22 February 2010) Subject: Use of cereals to produce biofuels According to statistics from the US Department of Agriculture, a quarter of the cereals produced in the USA (107 million tonnes) is used to produce biofuels. What is the Commission's assessment of the World Bank report (published by The Guardian ) which indicates that the use of cereals for biofuels has caused a 75 % rise in food prices? Can the Commission indicate what percentage of maize and other cereal crops grown in the EU is used to produce biofuels? Will the Commission make additional proposals to accelerate the production of second-generation biofuels?
