WRITTEN QUESTION E-4579/08 by Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) to the Council (7 August 2008) Subject: Threatened deportation of Iranian refugees in Camp Ashraf in Iraq It has been brought to my attention that following a visit to Tehran by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and a corresponding visit to Baghdad by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a decision was taken to cut off power, water and food supplies to the 4 000 residents of Camp Ashraf, who are Iranian dissidents who have fled the brutality of the Iranian regime, mainly intellectuals and political opponents of the regime. Not only does the deportation of political refugees constitute a breach of international law under the Geneva 4th Convention, but it is also likely that these individuals, who are members of the elite political opposition to the Iranian theocracy, will face lengthy imprisonment or execution. Five million Iraqis have petitioned the government against their deportation, but the Iraqi Government is keen to have excellent relations with its neighbour and has largely ignored Iranian involvement in the insurgency and even a missile attack on Camp Ashraf, on 4 July 2008, allegedly perpetrated by Iran. Is the Council aware of this matter and what action is it taking through the missions of the EU Member States in Tehran to protest against and hopefully prevent these deportations?
