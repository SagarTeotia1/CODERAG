the Member States to take steps to promote the eco-efficient development and production in the EU of these technologies and of the new and innovative technologies that are needed to achieve the ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; 14. Calls on the EU to continue to play an active role in the international negotiations to finalise an ambitious, comprehensive and legally binding agreement; notes the importance of the EU demonstrating its convictions and acting as a role model in demonstrating the benefits and viability of the low carbon economy; welcomes the outcome of the Durban conference in agreeing a clear timeline for drafting an international post-2012 agreement and the acceptance that large emitters, whether they be developed or developing economies, must adopt ambitious and sufficient targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; 15. Stresses that the EU must continue to act constructively in global climate negotiations, and that European climate diplomacy needs to be further developed under the umbrella of the EEAS; 16. Points out that the main challenge for a sustainable low carbon economy is to ensure that climate change policies are integrated into all key fields of activity relating to energy, transport, agriculture, education, innovation, etc; 17. Stresses that delaying global and European climate action would result in higher costs, not only for achieving the 2050 target due to stranded investment in high-carbon capital stock and slower technological learning, but also in terms of losing an innovative leading role for the EU in research, job creation and guidance for a greener sustainable economy; points out, furthermore, that delayed action for 2020 will result in reduced abatement potential for 2030 and beyond; 18. Reiterates that cumulative emissions are decisive for the climate system; notes that even with a pathway of 30 % reductions in 2020, 55 % in 2030, 75 % in 2040 and 90 % in 2050, the EU would still be responsible for approximately double its per capita share of the global 2°C compatible carbon budget, and that delaying emissions reductions increases the cumulative share significantly; 19. Recalls that limiting the raise of global temperature to an average of 2°C does not guarantee avoiding significant adverse climate impacts; The Emissions Trading System 20. Recognises that the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the principal instrument, although not the only one, for reducing industrial emissions and promoting investment in low carbon technologies; notes that further improvement of the ETS is necessary; calls on the Commission and the Member States to complement the EU ETS with a technology- and innovation-based approach in order to secure the significant reductions needed; 21. Notes that the EU ETS is functioning as designed, and that the lower carbon price is a result of reduced economic activity and available allowances far exceeding demand; expresses concern that the lack of stimulus for low carbon investments and greater energy efficiency risks putting the EU at a disadvantage towards its industrial competitors; acknowledges reports that the carbon price is not expected to increase in the absence of much higher growth or adjustment to the ETS;
