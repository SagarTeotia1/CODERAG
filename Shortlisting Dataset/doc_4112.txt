WRITTEN QUESTION E-1615/04 by Mogens Camre (UEN) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: EU funding for the Palestinian autonomous areas The Israeli newspaper Arutz Sheva and the German weekly Die Welt have reported in several articles (including one on 13 February 2004) the conclusions of a new OLAF report to the effect that EU aid to the Palestinian autonomous areas has been used, with the approval and signature of Arafat, for terrorist activities against Israeli Jews. In the light of the above, can the Commission state whether it continues to regard Arafat as a politically responsible administrator of funds for the Palestinian areas, and whether, in view of this new information, it is considering introducing a boycott of Palestinian products, by analogy with the plans which are being considered in relation to Israel?
