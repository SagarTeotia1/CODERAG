Notes that, in 2004, 97.76% of the appropriations entered in Parliament’s budget were committed, with a cancellation rate of 2.24%, and that, as in previous years, a very high level of budget implementation was achieved; 4. Calls on authorising officers by delegation to set out the reasons in their annual activity reports, as has already occurred to some extent, why budget appropriations have not been fully utilised; considers that account must be taken of those reasons during the following year’s budgetary discussions; 5. Notes that, in 2004, Parliament received revenue amounting to EUR 117 409 824 (2003: EUR 98 545 334); Parliament’s property policy, focusing on the Winston Churchill (WIC) and Salvador de Madariaga (SDM) Buildings Accounts 6.

Considers that repayments on buildings constitute a major saving for the taxpayer and therefore should be set as part of the budgetary strategy; 8. Calls yet again on the budgetary authority to establish budget forecasts ensuring that the amounts entered in the draft budget reflect real requirements in Parliament’s various policy areas so that huge transfers of appropriations are not systematically made at year-end for property policy purposes; 9. Calls for the tendering procedures for the building of the extension to the KAD building in Luxembourg to be transparent and fair, these being the first construction tendering procedures to be managed by the Parliament itself; 10. Welcomes the Secretary General's answer to the 2004 discharge questionnaire regarding the Parliament's use of the LOW building in Strasbourg that Parliament "is the sole owner of the LOW building in Strasbourg, and may use or dispose of it as it thinks fit," which accords with the idea that the Parliament as the democratic representative body in the European Union has the right and the
