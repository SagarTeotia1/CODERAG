negotiations with the Council, Parliament expects to make use of all the powers conferred on it under the interinstitutional agreement, including the flexibility instrument if necessary. The report stresses the importance of the solidarity principle, arguing that it must remain one of the EU's guiding principles, particularly for regional and development policy. Later in the year, the Budgets Committee will make an initial assessment of the 2009 preliminary draft budget, which will be presented at the July plenary session.

MEPs will also vote on a resolution. The summit, held every two years alternately in Europe and Latin America, seeks to strengthen strategic partnership between the two regions. This year's event, co-chaired by Peru and Slovenia (the holder of the EU presidency), will be attended by 60 heads of state or government. The two main topics on the agenda are, firstly poverty and inequality, secondly sustainable development, including climate change, environment and energy. Among key ideas being promoted by the Slovenian presidency are improved primary and vocational education and the development of small and medium-sized firms, which can play a key role in job-creation in Latin America. Previous summits The first EU-LAC summit was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. It sought to strengthen political, economic and cultural understanding between the two regions in order to encourage the development of a strategic partnership. Subsequent summits were held in Madrid in 2002 and Guadalajara in 2004. The last summit, in Vienna in 2006, re-stated the commitment of both regions to strengthen the bi-regional strategic association. It also took the decision to launch negotiations for an association agreement between the EU and Central America and paved the way for the launch of negotiations for an association agreement between the EU and the Andean Community.
