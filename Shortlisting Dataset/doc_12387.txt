WRITTEN QUESTION P-2155/06 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) to the Commission (11 May 2006) Subject: Compulsory fitting of soot filters on diesel cars to improve air quality Pursuant to Article 95 of the Treaty, the Netherlands has applied for an exemption from internal market rules in order to allow the Netherlands to impose more stringent restrictions on emissions of fine particulates by new diesel cars. In order to attain the lower emissions envisaged, manufacturers may use soot filters or any other existing technology. The reason for the application lies in the difficulty which the Netherlands faces in attaining air quality objectives, which is causing serious public health problems. The Netherlands is permitted to subsidise the fitting of soot filters, but this means that the bill is footed by the tax-payer instead of drivers of diesel cars. The Euro V standard for private cars is currently before Parliament. By means of amendments, earlier introduction of the standards can be achieved. The proposal for Euro VI standards for heavy vehicles is still being drafted by the Commission. 1. Does the Commission still believe that the ‘polluter pays’ principle should guide European environmental policy and legislation? 2. Will the Commission considerably accelerate the introduction of relevant parts of the Euro V standard, so as to make the fitting of soot filters to diesel cars compulsory from the beginning of 2007? 3. Will the Commission propose the same earlier introduction of more stringent Euro VI standards?
