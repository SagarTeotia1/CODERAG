WRITTEN QUESTION E-0765/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (1 March 2005) Subject: Landfill site in the municipality of Dodoni in Greece Local residents and their representative bodies in the municipality of Dodoni (in the prefecture of Ioanina) and neighbouring municipalities are opposed to the location of a landfill site at ‘Tsibouri’ in the district of Agia Anastasia. Objections have been raised, not only regarding the reliability of the environmental impact survey (which has not been sufficiently documented) but also the geological and hydrological characteristics of the area as described in the survey (soil permeability and the presence of wells). The following objections have been raised: — the projected landfill site will be located near a valley of archaeological and ecological significance; — Member States are required to ensure the disposal of solid wastes without damage to the environment, the landscape or the area in question (Directive 75/442/EEC) OJ L 194, 25.07.1975, p. 39 . ; — it must be clearly stated what preventive and protective measures are to be taken to obviate any short-term and long-term threats to the environment and, in particular, prevent the pollution of groundwater by leachate infiltration (Directive 1993/31/EC) OJ L 182, 16.07.1999, p. 1 . ; — the project is to be co-funded; — under Directive 75/442/EEC, the authority or authorities responsible are required to draw up one or more surveys of suitable solid waste disposal sites. Given the need for a landfill site, will the Commission consider calling on the Greek authorities to consider alternative sites in accordance with the provisions of the above directives?
