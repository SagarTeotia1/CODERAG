Question for written answer E-000550/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (26 January 2012) Subject: Use of EU structural funds in the field of health The HIV situation calls for special attention at both EU and national level. Recent studies have highlighted a series of worrying data in Italy: 25 % of those suffering from HIV are unaware of it. In addition, 60 % of diagnoses occur when the disease is already too advanced to be able to begin antiretroviral therapy. Investing in prevention and promoting voluntary HIV testing is therefore surely of fundamental importance. Effective prevention campaigns not only prevent the disease from spreading further, but also allow the right to health and the dignity of the person affected by HIV to be better protected. As is well known, around 36 % of the EU budget (approximately 335 million in the 2006-2013 period) is spent on structural funds supporting regional and local government integration projects. In this context, the vast amount of resources provided by the Union is not always fully used within projects. In reality, a large proportion of structural funds remains unused, when they could be channelled towards other types of intervention. Given the importance of policies to combat and prevent HIV, could the Commission state: — if it is possible to provide for the reuse of EU structural funds that are not used for projects dealing with HIV prevention and to promote wider distribution of HIV tests?
