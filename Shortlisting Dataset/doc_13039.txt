Reply (23 April 2008) The EU has for many years called for an inclusive transition to democracy, the release of all political prisoners and a lifting of restrictions placed on the operation of political parties, representatives of ethnic groups and civil society organisations in Burma/Myanmar. In recent weeks in particular, the Council has again underlined that only a process that involves the full participation of the opposition and ethnic groups will lead to national reconciliation and stability. The EU has given bold support to the UN’s demands for a more inclusive process of constitutional drafting and improvements to the likely substance of the draft Constitution. It has also supported UN Special Adviser Gambari’s calls for guarantees that the announced referendum be fair and free and subject to international monitoring. The EU will continue to press these points with the Burmese regime and Burma’s neighbours.
