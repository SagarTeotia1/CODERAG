Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (18 January 2010) The Commission does not publish its own data on oil reserves, or any other fossil fuels reserves, but makes use of a wide range of different data sources such as those published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the governments of the producing countries, industry and other specialised sources. As an example, please refer to page 30 of the 2008 report on Europe's energy position, upper and lower estimates of fossil fuels proved reserves, published by the ‘Market Observatory for Energy’ Unit of the Commission at the following Internet address: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/publications/doc/2008_moe_maquette.pdf). The Commission is aware of ongoing discussions between experts on the difficulties concerning the estimation of world oil reserves. On one side, the ‘pessimists’ forecast an imminent peak and subsequent terminal decline in the global production of conventional oil, while on the other side, the ‘optimists’ emphasise the importance of investment and new technology and point to the long history of failed predictions of the ‘end of oil’. The Commission is and will continue to analyse the different elements which may have an impact on the future availability of oil, such as the repercussions of the recent financial crisis and recession on planned investments for exploration and production. If investments are cancelled or deferred, there is a risk that there will be a constraint on oil supply when demand picks up as the world economy recovers. In addition, as oil reserves get increasingly difficult to access and develop, the oil price will need to reflect this for these resources to be developed. Considering the irrevocable fact that the world will eventually run out of oil and conscious of the major role that the combustion of fossil fuels plays in the climate warming, the European energy and climate policy intends to globally decarbonise the energy and transport sector. International technology cooperation and the using of market based instruments, notably emissions trading to accelerate the global market penetration of more efficient and carbon neutral technologies and fuels as well as developing new technologies are key policies to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, including oil.
