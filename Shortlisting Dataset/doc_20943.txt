WRITTEN QUESTION E-1145/10 by Marietta Giannakou (PPE) to the Commission (4 March 2010) Subject: Institutional balance aspects of the new financial supervision structure The framework for supervising financial services which is currently under construction with the creation of the European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) and the European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC) is expected to contribute to improving the functioning of the Single Market and also to reducing systemic risks by predicting them more accurately. However, apart from the need for a more integrated supervisory structure, the establishment of the new authorities will essentially support integration in the financial services sector at Community level. The ESFS and the ESRC will strengthen microeconomic and macroeconomic supervision, respectively. In view of the new role which the above authorities are expected to play, will the Commission say. 1. Will the creation of the new supervisory authorities affect the institutional balance of Community institutions, in particular in the event of a potential clash of interests between the principal objective of the European Central Bank, which is to maintain price stability, and the aims of the ESRC, particularly in view of the composition of the latter? 2. How are the ESRC and the ESFS authorities expected to bind the EU internationally with their rules governing financial services, given that the ESRC's recommendations are non-binding and there will be no mechanisms to enforce them, while no specific provisions exist about how the authorities constituting the ESFS will be held accountable?
