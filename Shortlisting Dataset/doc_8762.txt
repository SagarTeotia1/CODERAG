Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (28 January 2011) ITGI and TAP are gas interconnectors within the the European Union and the Energy Community Treaty contracting parties. Both projects have a considerable potential to enhance the security of gas supplies in the EU, and the Commission has therefore actively given material, political, legal and regulatory support to both. Furthermore, both projects are recognised as priority projects being part of the priority axis NG.3 in the framework of Decision No 1364/2006/EC OJ L 262, 22.9.2006 . of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks. Both ITGI and TAP have, in principle, access to the capacity of the existing gas pipelines on Greek territory in order to receive, should they wish, gas arriving through the Turkey‑Greece interconnector. Since the commercial promoters require that the pipelines be filled, both projects need to obtain access to further sources of gas. Both pipelines could, in theory, access gas from various sources, including the Caspian region, the Middle East and the international LNG market. With regard to timetables, the commercial promoters should provide the Honourable Member with such information.
