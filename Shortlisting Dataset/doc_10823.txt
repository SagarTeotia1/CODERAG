WRITTEN QUESTION E-5192/08 by Stavros Arnaoutakis (PSE) to the Commission (30 September 2008) Subject: Checks on and trade in organic food in Greece According to documents published by organic farming bodies, Greece has seen an increase in the number of firms trading in and distributing organic products and food of all kinds. It is also estimated that around a thousand commercial firms are subject to inadequate checks or no checks at all, as laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 OJ L 198, 22.7.1991, p.1. . How does the Commission guarantee that the necessary public checks are carried out on all commercial enterprises dealing with organic products so as to prevent distortions of competition (within and outside the European Union) and protect consumers?
