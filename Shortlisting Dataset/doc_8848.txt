WRITTEN QUESTION P-1290/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (31 March 2005) Subject: Turkey ignores international arrest warrants The written and oral answers given by the new Commissioner Mr Rehn during his hearing before the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs and his first written answers to questions by Parliament reveal a lack of concern about the situation in Cyprus where there has been a de facto division of Greeks and Turks on racist lines since immediately after the Turkish invasion of 1974. The Commissioner has not addressed this issue, which is a disgrace for today’s Europe; instead he has been giving answers which might give rise to the suspicion that Turkey is being treated in a privileged manner and rewarded for its anti-democratic behaviour both within and outside its territory. In my Question E‑2537/04 I mentioned that the murderer of the Cypriot citizen Solomos Solomou (and former ‘minister’ of the occupied territories), Kenan Akin, had been arrested in Istanbul, but immediately released, despite the fact that Interpol had issued an international arrest warrant for him in 1996. I had asked whether the candidate country Turkey was entitled to ignore an international arrest warrant. The Commissioner had replied that ‘the Commission is not able to comment on criminal proceedings in individual cases.’ Since his answer is wholly inadequate and may lead to other — broadly unjust — conclusions about the privileged treatment of Turkey by the Commission, I am obliged to repeat my question: is the candidate country Turkey entitled to ignore international arrest warrants?
