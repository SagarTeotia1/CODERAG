WRITTEN QUESTION E-4605/06 by Jens Holm (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (26 October 2006) Subject: Referendum on EMU in Poland In Poland, there are plans to hold a referendum on accession to EMU. The Polish President, Lech Kaczynski, has mentioned 2010 as a possible date for Polish citizens to go to the polls and democratically decide on the introduction of the euro into the country. According to the media, these plans have given rise to considerable concern within the Commission. In Sweden, a referendum was held in 2003, when a convincing majority decided that the country would not join EMU. This vote was also respected by the EU, even though Sweden had not negotiated a legal exemption. What measures does the Commission plan to take if Poland holds a referendum on EMU? Does the Commission consider that Poland would still be bound to accede to EMU, even if a majority of Poles were to reject EMU accession in a referendum?
