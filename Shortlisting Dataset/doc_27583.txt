Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (27 May 2011) Data related to fatal accident causes shows a consistent and unchanging pattern in Europe and globally: speeding, drink-driving and failure to use a seat belt are the main causes. While the number of road fatalities on EU roads in 2010 fell below 31 000, an essential contributing factor in around 30 % of fatal accidents was inappropriate speed. It is however not possible, on the basis of the European CARE database The database was created following Council Decision 93/704/EC, OJ L329 of 30.12.1993. For more information on CARE: http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/statistics/care_reports_graphics/index_en.htm , to establish whether there is a direct statistical correlation between road fatalities and the maximum speed motorway limits. Although speed limits are generally higher on motorways than on other parts of the road network, motorways are the safest infrastructure for a number of reasons, such as design, maintenance and greater homogeneity of road users. Though, it is important to stress that the problem is often inappropriate speed rather than high speed, as speeds have to be adapted to the circumstances (bad weather, lack of visibility, traffic density).
