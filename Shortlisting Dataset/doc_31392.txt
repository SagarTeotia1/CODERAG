China is interested in new European projects such as Sesame and zero-emission coal power plants. On the occasion of Commissioner Potočnik’s visit to Beijing in April 2005, agreement was reached on strengthening political cooperation in the S&T sector. This will entail, for instance: — joint preparations by China and the EU for a China S&T Year in Europe; — a technology dialogue with the European Chamber of Commerce in China; — opportunities for promoting cooperation involving technology platforms; — encouragement of mobility, e.g. by comparing measures taken in the Member States; — better coordination of S&T cooperation among EU Member States through the CO-REACH project (the Chinese Government welcomes this project unequivocally and is eager to cooperate); — possible cooperation in the field of conventional medicine; — further measures to promote S&T cooperation in all sectors in the context of FP6/FP7 and of the Chinese programmes 863 (High technology) and 973 (Basic research); — an annual meeting at Commissioner/Ministerial level.
