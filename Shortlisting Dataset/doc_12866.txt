the UK, Hungary and Canada, although the population in Britain was decimated during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001.", " The exact composition of the breed has never been declared but it was based on high-performance animals in existing flocks of Dorset Horn, Bluefaced Leicester and Eastrip Prolific sheep kept by the Alderson family.", " Additional individual animals were selected from Lleyn, Texel and East Friesian breeds.", " Subsequent selection was based on measures of productivity, without regard for uniformity of appearance.", " A standardised breed type emerged gradually as the blending process continued.", " The animals were exposed to rugged conditions in the upper Pennines in northern England to develop robustness and adaptability.", " Progeny testing from the initial stages laid the foundation for continuous genetic improvement.", " Initially, total ownership of females of the breed was retained by the family and only rams were sold, but groups of females were released to other breeders in 1981.", " Numbers of flocks and animals increased rapidly and there were more than 5,000 breeding ewes by the mid-1980s with flocks widespread in Britain.", " A flock book was published in 1986.", " As the name of the breed suggests, it is a prolific milk producer, and several large dairy flocks were established.", " However, it is a robust, general-purpose sheep rather than a specialist dairy breed.", " It is known for its extremely high prolificacy, and rams are used to sire high-performance crossbred daughters.", " The quality of its carcase and wool are extra beneficial traits.", " In all countries outside Britain, the British Milksheep is used more as a dairying breed with dual-purpose qualities, but it is used also in most countries as a crossing sire; in Britain on hill and longwool breeds, in France in the Alps and Pyrenees on mountain breeds, in Greece on Chios dairy ewes, and in Hungary on the predominant Merino population.", " In France it has contributed to the development of the Boulonnais breed." ] ] ] }
