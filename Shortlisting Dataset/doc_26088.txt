Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (23 June 2011) High Representative/Vice‑President (HR/VP) Ashton was deeply saddened by the assassination of Minister for Minorities Shahbaz Bhatti, all the more so since he had stood up for the principles of equality and human rights in Pakistan. She strongly condemned this violent act in a statement issued on 2 March 2011 and referred in particular to the climate of intolerance and violence linked to the controversy over the blasphemy laws. The HR/VP urged the Pakistani authorities to do their utmost to ensure the protection of those in the Government and civil society who have spoken out on these matters and to bring to justice those responsible for these crimes. The EU has called on Pakistan to respect human rights guaranteed under international conventions to which the country is a party. Pakistan’s Constitution provides for freedom of religion and requires the state to safeguard the rights of minorities. Pakistan is also a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The EU has repeatedly brought up the continued application of the blasphemy laws with the Government of Pakistan as part of the human rights dialogue and will continue to do so. It is the EU’s view that the blasphemy laws in their present form are open to abuse. The EU has encouraged the Government of Pakistan to amend the more controversial aspects of the blasphemy legislation; furthermore the EU maintains that total repeal of the blasphemy laws, and the death penalty, should be considered by Pakistan. Human rights issues, including the question of the blasphemy laws, have been discussed at meetings of the EU‑Pakistan Joint Commission and the sub-group on governance, human rights and migration. The EU has also raised the issue at the summit with Pakistan on 4 June 2010.
