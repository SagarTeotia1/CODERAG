Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (25 September 2009) According to Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 OJ L 81, 21.3.2001. listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement, Turkish nationals require a visa to travel to the European Union. The ruling delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 19 February 2009 in Case C‑228/06, Mehmet Soysal and Ibrahim Savatli , provides that ‘Article 41(1) of the Additional Protocol [to the Agreement establishing an Association between the EEC and Turkey of 12 September 1963], which was signed on 23 November 1970 at Brussels and concluded, approved and confirmed on behalf of the Community by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2760/72 of 19 December 1972 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2760/72 of 19 December 1972 concluding the additional protocol and the financial protocol signed on 23 November 1970 and annexed to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey and relating to the measures to be taken for their implementation, (Unofficial translation), OJ L 293, 29.12.1972. , is to be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the introduction, as from the entry into force of that protocol, of a requirement that Turkish nationals such as the appellants in the main proceedings must have a visa to enter the territory of a Member State in order to provide services there on behalf of an undertaking established in Turkey, since, on that date, such a visa was not required’. Article 41 of the Additional Protocol lays down a ‘standstill’ clause, which stipulates that ‘the Contracting Parties shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services’. The abovementioned ruling has to be read in the context of the Association Agreement between the EEC and Turkey, which establishes reciprocal rights and obligations on both sides. In cooperation with the Council, the Member States and Turkey, the Commission is currently analysing this ruling, in order to draw the appropriate conclusions. It can already be inferred from this ruling that, in principle, Turkish nationals residing in Turkey and travelling to a Member State in order to provide services there on behalf of an undertaking established in Turkey do not require a visa to enter the territory of that Member State, if the Member State in question did not require such a visa at the time of the entry into force, with regard to that Member State, of the Additional Protocol of 23 November 1970. From the preliminary assessment of this ruling, carried out notably on the basis of information communicated to the Commission by the Member States, it appears that, at the time the standstill clause entered into force for them, 16 Member States required a visa from all Turkish nationals; they are therefore not affected by the Soysal ruling. Out of the 11 other Member States that did in principle exempt Turkish citizens from the visa
