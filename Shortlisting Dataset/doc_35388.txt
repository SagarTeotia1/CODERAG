Question for written answer P-003734/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Gilles Pargneaux (S&D) (14 April 2011) Subject: Ban on the exploration and extraction of shale gas on EU territory Can the Commission guarantee that the exploration and extraction of shale gas complies with the Water Framework Directive (WFD)? Does the Commission intend to carry out a comprehensive scientific study, in line with the precautionary principle, of the environmental impact of shale gas extraction? In accordance with that same principle, is it not within the Commission's remit to ban outright the exploration and extraction of shale oil and gas on EU territory, whether by vertical or horizontal drilling followed by the hydraulic fracturing of the rock?
