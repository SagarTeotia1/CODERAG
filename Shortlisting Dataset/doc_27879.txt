Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (5 December 2011) The Commission takes note of the study referred to by the Honourable Member carried out by the University of Bristol. Comprehensive school education on this matter, building public awareness, and promoting a healthier lifestyle are all tools that can be used to prevent possible effects related to long exposure to screens. However, the EU has no competence to act in the area addressed in the Honourable Member's question as this is the competence of the Member States.
