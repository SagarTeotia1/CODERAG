Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (14 December 2011) The Commission has provided substantial funding for research on aneuploidies throughout the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (FP6, 2002-2006 and FP7, 2007-2013). In FP6, two Integrated Projects, AnEUploidy http://www.aneuploidy.eu/ and MitoCheck http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/genomics/projects/integratedprojects_en.htm#Mikotech were funded providing the impetus for the research on molecular mechanisms involved in aneuploidies including Down's syndrome. In 2011, under the FP7 ‘Ideas’ Work Programme, two projects, PRECISE http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP7_PROJ_EN&ACTION=D&DOC=1&CAT=PROJ&RCN=96821 and LONGCHROM http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP7_PROJ_EN&ACTION=D&DOC=9&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=012d0c1a8a59:8bac:55bb75f2&RCN=99068 have been launched, furthering our understanding on aneuploidies and their implications for human health. Altogether, the EU contribution to the abovementioned projects amounts to EUR 23 million. In the FP7 Health Theme, the tendency has been to move towards broader and less specific research topics implemented through a two-stage submission and evaluation procedure which allows different research ideas to compete against each other. The past FP7 Health calls have included topics addressing genetic diseases, e.g. the development of molecular diagnostics tools, and harmonisation, validation and standardisation of genetic testing, which have been open also for research on aneuploidies. Also, the current call for proposals includes a dedicated topic for exploring the clinical utility of –omics technologies for rare diseases which could support research on the rare forms of aneuploidies (e.g. trisomies 9p, 13 and 18) in the context of the International Rare Disease Research Consortium (IRDiRC). The Commission proposal for the Horizon 2020 Programme is expected to include substantial financial support for Health research, including research on determinants for health, disease mechanisms and improvement of diagnostics, thus proving possible funding opportunities for research on aneuploidies also in the future.
