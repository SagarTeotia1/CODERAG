Question for written answer E-009451/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marisa Matias (GUE/NGL) (20 October 2011) Subject: Authorisation for the felling of cork oaks in the Tua river valley The Portuguese Government has authorised the felling of 1 104 cork oaks (Quercus suber: 935 fully grown, 169 young) and 4 134 holm oaks (Quercus ilex: 3 174 fully grown and 960 young) to allow for the first stage of construction of the Foz do Tua dam. The felling of these trees is prohibited in Portugal, but the government has authorised it by declaring the project of overriding public interest through Order No 13491/2011 (10 October 2011). The cork and holm oaks' habitats are under great threat, and the species have protection at European level through the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). The Nature 2000 network classifies ‘dehesas’ (habitat 6 310), cork oak forests (habitat 9 330) and holm oak forests (habitat 9 340) as very important for the preservation of biodiversity. The government order itself mentions ‘plantations of these species and small communities of great ecological value’. The authorisation of this felling affects the region's natural heritage and jeopardises European protection of these species. In light of the above, can the Commission give the following information: 1. What measures will the Commission take to guarantee the conservation of these species protected by the ‘Habitats Directive’, particularly regarding their felling? 2. The governmental order alludes to the ‘absence of valid alternatives to this site, which was chosen at the time of the environmental impact assessment’. However, no alternative was looked into at the time of the assessment. The Commission has a technical study on the national programme of high hydro-electric potential dams — of which the above project is part — which has not been made public (answer to my Written Question E‑0932/2010). The study in question having been paid for by public money and being of manifest public interest, does the Commission not intend to make it public?
