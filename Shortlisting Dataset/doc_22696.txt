Question for written answer E-002305/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Syed Kamall (ECR) (29 February 2012) Subject: Somalian refugees at the Lutsk detention centre in Ukraine I have been contacted by a constituent who is concerned about the situation of a group of Somalian refugees who are on hunger strike at the Lutsk detention centre in Ukraine. Can the Commission confirm: 1. if it is aware of the hunger strikes at this detention centre; 2. what discussions it has had with the Ukrainian government about fixing its system for processing asylum‑seekers in order to bring it into line with international standards; 3. if it will make representations to the Ukrainian government about issuing temporary residence permits to Somalian refugees, who are now being routinely re-arrested and detained by the police?
