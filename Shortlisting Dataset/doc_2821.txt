Question for written answer E-3757/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Graham Watson (ALDE) (27 May 2010) Subject: Re-use and Recycling European Union Social Enterprises (RREUSE) RREUSE is a European umbrella organisation for social enterprises with activities in re-use, repair and recycling. It represents 9 000 European social enterprises which help avoid 750000 tons of waste and supports approximately 42 000 full-time jobs and over 120 000 volunteers across ten Member States. The UK still sends two-thirds of household waste to landfills, more than any other country in Europe, which results in increased emissions of methane and loss of material that could be put to more productive uses through re-use and recycling. 1. In light of this, can the Commission elaborate on why it has decided to stop funding for this project? 2. Can the Commission offer an alternative route to funding for European NGOs working to increase reuse and recycling, such as RREUSE?
