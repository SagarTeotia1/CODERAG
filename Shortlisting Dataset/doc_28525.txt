Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (28 June 2011) A Member State leaving the Union is no longer part of the euro area. Article 50(2) TEU foresees that arrangements should be negotiated with the State leaving the Union. There is no case law, as no Member State has ever left the EU. A euro area Member State leaving the EU and reintroducing a currency of its own would most likely face extreme difficulties to finance itself on the market, thus running the risk to impoverishing its citizens.
