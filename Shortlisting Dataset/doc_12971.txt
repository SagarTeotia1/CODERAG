Amendment 21 Recital 6 a (new) (6a) Consequently, in drawing up the management plan, account should also be taken of the fact that the high fishing mortality rate for plaice is due to a great extent to the large discard from beam-trawl sole fishing with 80 mm nets in the southern parts of the North Sea.
