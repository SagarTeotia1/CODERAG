the case of rice seed, the maximum quantity shall be determined on the basis of the average quantity harvested during a reference period to be established.’ Article 3(4a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 is replaced by the following: “4a. The maximum quantity of seed which is eligible for aid in the Community, and other essential features of the stabiliser mechanism, in particular the manner and method of calculating the maximum quantity and the reduction in the event of exceeding the maximum guaranteed quantity, shall be determined by the Council on a proposal from the Commission after consulting the European Parliament . Except in the case of rice seed, the maximum quantity shall be determined on the basis of the average quantity harvested during a reference period to be established.’ Justification Because of its considerable financial significance for the sector, the stabiliser mechanism should not be determined by the comitology method but by the Council after consulting Parliament. Amendment 7 Article 1a (new) 1a. The following shall be inserted in Article 3(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71: ‘4b. In the event of the guaranteed quantity being exceeded in a marketing year, the reduction to be made to the aid payable shall be offset against the aid payable in the subsequent marketing year.’ Justification In the event of the guaranteed quantity being exceeded, the resultant reduction in aid should be implemented not in the marketing year when the excess arises but in the next marketing year. This will ensure that aid payments are not kept back until the whole year’s production is known, thereby compelling farmers to wait unnecessarily long for their money. Amendment 8 Article 1b (new) 1b. The following shall be inserted in Article 3(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71: 4c. No later than the date on which it submits its proposal establishing the aid for the 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 marketing years, the Commission shall submit to Parliament and the Council, on the basis of a study into the operation of the organisation of the market and, in particular, the stabilisers, a proposal establishing the maximum guaranteed quantities pursuant to Article 37 of the EC Treaty. Justification Self-explanatory.
