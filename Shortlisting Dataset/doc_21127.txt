intercultural dialogue and other confidence-building measures within and outside the EU, the first requirement being to reach a common understanding of the concept of "intercultural dialogue" inside the EU; also considers it essential to examine the contributory factors leading to the radicalisation and recruitment of Muslims inside and outside Europe; Means available to the European Union in the area of its external action to combat terrorism 29. Emphasises the many-faceted nature of the responses available to the European Union in the area of external action to combat terrorism and the need for Member States to bring together and use in a coherent manner their political, preventive and suppressive instruments involving police and judicial cooperation, intelligence and communication, and all other types of responses called for and endorsed by the United Nations and forming part of a multilateral strategy; 30. Draws attention to the recommendations contained in its resolution of 28 September 2006 Texts Adopted, P6_TA(2006)0382 . , and stresses in particular that if, with a view to implementing development cooperation, a large number of objectives are pursued that are only indirectly linked, or not linked at all, to the strategy laid down in the European Consensus on Development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (for which the UN believes additional annual aid of USD 50 billion is needed), it will become significantly more difficult to take effective action against poverty; 31. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pursue an anti-terrorism policy that is careful not to undermine the contribution made by European development cooperation to drawing up and implementing strategies aimed at effectively combating poverty and at preventing – increasingly prolonged – violent conflicts, particularly in Africa; 32. Stresses that the response adopted by the EU in the face of terrorism must be proportionate and properly targeted on the fight against terrorism, bearing in mind that, until proved otherwise, the most productive measures in the fight against new forms of terrorism are effective intelligence and police services, in other words activities which, however legitimate, do not come within development cooperation policy or the fight against poverty; 33. Reiterates, therefore, its proposal to render the Union's anti-terrorist policy more coherent and effective in its relations with third countries through: a) the enhancement of political dialogue in this regard, in particular with those countries with which the European Union and/or its Member States have concluded or are negotiating Association or Cooperation Agreements; b) political and commercial support and development aid to moderate Islamic countries, relating both to the fight against terrorism and to the political, economic and social reforms implemented in those countries; c) a stepping-up of the dialogue on and cooperation in the fight against terrorism with the major partners of the Union (Israel, Japan, Australia, Canada, Russia, etc.) and, in particular, the United States, which is in the front line in the fight against terrorism, without affecting under any circumstances the level of protection afforded to human rights; d) the promotion of international consensus for the adoption of the Global Convention on International Terrorism and the
