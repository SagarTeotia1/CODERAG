expects the Council to be consistent with its statement made in the context of its guidelines for budget 2001, in favour of genuine and constructive cooperation; 10. Notes the Commission proposals for re-programming the financial commitments of the Union in headings 3 and 4 - proposals which have only indicative status for the budgetary authority; considers that the Union should honour the financial commitments it makes, both internally and externally, and within the time-scale envisaged for their implementation; warns that it would do the Union irreparable political damage if it were unilaterally to conduct a large-scale withdrawal from its financial commitments either towards its own Member States or towards third states; 11. States, as a general principle of budgetary discipline and sound financial management, that commitments should correspond as closely as possible to real, clearly-identified needs and to the capacity of potential beneficiaries actually to absorb the expenditure within the time-scale foreseen for the action concerned; warns against the growing disjuncture between commitments made and the actual disbursement of payments; declares its openness to work together with the other institutions to find new ways of improving implementation; 12. Regrets the renewed Commission tendency in the PDB to discontinue budget lines originally created at the initiative of Parliament or considered by Parliament to be of particular importance; warns the Commission that it cannot unilaterally reduce or ignore existing commitments in other sectors merely to find a certain quantity of reductions which it might consider necessary in order to finance new commitments, especially in heading 4; On the ad hoc procedure Agriculture 13. Confirms its willingness to review the agriculture forecast in October 2000 and considers it inappropriate to reduce the ceiling of heading 1 for the 2001 budget before a clear situation of market forecasts is available; reminds that the Early Warning Paper No 5/2000 shows an increase of expenditure in 7 sectors; 14. Criticises the Commission for not taking into account Parliament's opinion of 3 May 2000 Texts Adopted, Item 2. regarding the school milk scheme when presenting the preliminary draft budget for 2001; reiterates its insistence on adequate funding of the measure proportional to the utilisation of appropriations in previous years; 15. Considers that budget allocations to counter future outbreaks of animal disease are difficult to estimate as has been noted during the latest outbreaks of swine fever (1997/98) and mad cow disease (1996/98); insists on the creation of a special reserve where appropriations are only called on when necessary; therefore, calls on the Commission to carry out a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of action to date to combat animal diseases, including the implications of eastward enlargement; 16. Considers that appropriations for the promotion of agricultural products and food quality ( B1-380 and B1-406 ) are not allocated in a coherent way, and the choice of products is arbitrary, and demands that these measures should be strengthened, as requested since the dioxin crisis in 1999; 17. Welcomes the Commission's initiative to budgetise in heading 1b the full amount available under the financial perspective; considers, nevertheless, that the Commission's expectation that all appropriations
