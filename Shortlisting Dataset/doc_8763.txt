Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (22 April 2008) The major part of the Community assistance to the Maldives has been allocated in the framework of the post tsunami reconstruction programme, which amounted to EUR 16.9 million. Of this EUR 0.9 million is for repair of damaged houses, EUR 2 million for the recovery of communities (including livelihoods in the sectors of fisheries and agriculture) and EUR 14 million for the inter-islands regional ‘Safe Islands’ development, upgrading and increasing the capacity of schools, health community centres and waste management facilities and at improving the management of public finances. Moreover, the Commission adopted on 16 May 2007 the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2007‑13 and Multi-annual Indicative Programme (MIP) 2007‑10, amounting to EUR 10 million. The focal sector (circa 70 % of the total amount) will be dedicated to the inter-islands regional development to complement and reinforce what has been done with the Tsunami related aid and namely to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and ensure a secure, durable environment, by supporting in those islands appropriate physical and social facilities and services, such as schools, clinics, water-sanitation facilities, etc. There are two non-focal sectors: trade- related technical assistance to enhance trade capacity and assistance to democratisation and good governance. No EC funds managed by the Commission have targeted tourism development in the Maldives. However, the Maldives received from the European Investment Bank (EIB) a loan amounting to EUR 50 million at preferred interest rate to finance infrastructure reconstruction, namely in the tourism sector.
