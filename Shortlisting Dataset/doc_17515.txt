WRITTEN QUESTION P-2615/06 by Andrzej Szejna (PSE) to the Commission (9 June 2006) Subject: Community patent Taking into consideration the importance of a well-established and properly functioning patent system for competitiveness, innovation, growth and employment in the knowledge-based economy, the problem of the Community patent system should be addressed. After the failure to reach an agreement on the regulation on the Community patent, the Commission launched a debate dealing with aspects of the Community patent system. The consultations were closed on 12 April 2006. However, some objections have been raised with regard to the availability of the form for answers, additionally claiming consultations made in such a way may be considered invalid. Is the outcome of the consultation in accordance with the Commission's expectations, and does the Commission consider the feedback from the stakeholder reliable enough to regard the consultations as binding?
