Question for written answer E-012076/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (20 December 2011) Subject: Impact of air pollution on health and the environment Air pollution from the major European industrial installations cost the citizens of Europe somewhere between EUR 102 and 169 billion in 2009. That is the estimate of the European Environment Agency, which has tried to assess in financial terms the damage to human health and the environment caused by emissions from such installations. The damage to the health of Europe’s citizens includes respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and in many cases the effects are long-lasting. Air pollution thus costs every EU citizen between EUR 200 and 300 a year. The biggest polluters include German, Polish, French and British firms. The cost estimates were based on the emissions declared by the polluters themselves. These findings emphasise again the need to revise European air quality legislation, something which the Commission is proposing to do in 2013. How does the Commission propose to overcome the opposition that any attempt on its part to revise European air quality legislation and to impose stricter emissions limits is bound to provoke from the Member States?
