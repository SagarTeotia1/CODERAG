WRITTEN QUESTION E-5622/09 by Antigoni Papadopoulou (S&D) , Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) and Takis Hadjigeorgiou (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (18 November 2009) Subject: Contracts of temporary agents from the ten new Member States There is intense concern that the Commission does not intend to renew the contracts of temporary agents from the ten new Member States whose contracts are due to expire very shortly. As is very well known, the contracts contain no specific clause which might justify non-renewal; on the contrary, the contracts are renewable for a further three years in the interests of the Commission. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. If a Community agent is dismissed or does not have his or her contract renewed, is the employer — in this case the European Community — obliged to pay him or her 60 % of his or her salary for one year and also to pay repatriation expenses? 2. Does it intend to fill the specific posts and, if so, why are existing contracts not being renewed until such time as it can recruit permanent staff from successful candidates in competitions and why does it instead prefer to recruit and train new people, thereby irrationally increasing the Community budget? 3. Finally, since it has promised safety valves for jobs, i.e. quotas, corresponding to the ten new Member States, why has it only held one internal competition and what will the Commission's programme be for jobs corresponding to the ten Member States in question?
