It also wants to be granted the power to decide on further changes to the ceiling without going through a full legislative process. Parliament will vote on Tuesday morning on whether to apply an urgency procedure to this proposal – if it does, it could complete its passage through Parliament during this plenary week. An EU law from 2002 established a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States balances of payments, replacing previous rules from 1969. This facility is provided for in the Treaty (Article 119), whereby the EU can grant mutual assistance to a Member State "in difficulties or seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal", provided this Member State does not belong to the euro area. The 2002 regulation lowed the ceiling on such funding to €12 billion, from €16 billion, as at the time there were only three Member States outside the euro area. Recent events suggest this may not be enough, should several Member States need significant support. The Commission is therefore proposing to raise this ceiling to €25 billion. Streamlined procedure for future changes? The Commission also wants, given the possible need for urgent decisions during periods of market turmoil, to avoid the need for full legislation if the ceiling urgently needs to be changed again. It is therefore asking to be granted itself the power to decide a revision of the ceiling, after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) of the Council on both the urgency and the new ceiling to introduce. Parliamentary procedure The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will consider the proposal at its meeting on Monday evening. The full Parliament will then vote on Tuesday morning on whether to apply the urgency procedure (Rule 134). If this is approved the proposal itself will be debated and put to the vote later in the week. Support under this scheme has recently been proposed for Hungary – for more information see the press release from the Commission via the link below. No such support is available for euro area Member States.
