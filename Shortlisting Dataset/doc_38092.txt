Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (8 April 2011) The Commission does not consider it necessary, at this stage, to further regulate charges for cross-border cash withdrawals. Charges for cross-border cash withdrawals from ATMs in the EU are already partially regulated, for withdrawals in euro. According to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on cross-border payments in the Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001, OJ L 266, 9.10.2009. , charges for euro withdrawals in other EU Member States should be the same as charges for euro withdrawals at cash dispensers in the Member State where the card was issued. In other words, within the euro-area countries, charges for national and cross-border withdrawals are the same. As regards, non-euro-area Member States, these States may decide to extend the application of the regulation to their currencies. The use of the options in Article 14 and Article 3(3) of the regulation requires banks to apply the same charges for cross-border payments in euro and for national payments in the national currency. This includes cross-border cash withdrawals in euro, which should be charged at the same level as withdrawals in the national currency.
