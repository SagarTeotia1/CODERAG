Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (12 January 2006) The reported facts about this case and others of alleged proselytising have been brought to the Commission’s attention. The background of such events seems to be a certain amount of religious and communal tensions in parts of Indonesia. This intolerance is not limited to Christians, as it occurs towards Muslims and among Muslim groups of different theological orientation. The diversity of religious beliefs — with the five officially recognised religions and their various shades among the people — is part and parcel of the Indonesian Republic since independence. While some politicians even indicate sympathy for aggressors and while the forces of order sometimes fail to intervene, President Yudhoyono as well as his Government and leaders of influential Muslim mass organisations continue to emphasise their commitment to upholding religious freedom. Given this principled policy orientation, the Commission believes that a continued dialogue with the Indonesian authorities is the best approach to address the problems. In this context, the Interfaith Dialogue Conference, which the Commission and the Indonesian Government hosted in July 2005 in Bali, should be recalled. The Commission intends to further this dialogue on the benefits of tolerance and pluralism to help counteract the current trend towards increased communal conflict.
