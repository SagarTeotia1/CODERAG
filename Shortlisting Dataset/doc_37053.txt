Question for Question Time H-0267/2010 to the Commission Part-session: June 2010 Rule 116 Ivo Belet (PPE) Subject: Invasions of privacy by Google Street View On Friday, 14 May 2010, following repeated calls and investigations by European and national authorities, Google finally revealed which forms of data have been captured and stored by the Street View vans. The company was forced to concede that items of private data had been illegally stored. Although Google has tried to portray this as nothing more than an oversight, it is clear that the privacy of European consumers has been invaded. Is the Commission considering taking action against such invasions of privacy in various Member States?
