REGI Enhanced Cooperation with the Committee of the Regions (CoR) Relations with the CoR are of paramount importance to REGI, and efforts have been made to enhance them as much as possible. The most visible result of the REGI-CoR cooperation is the Open Days - European week of regions and cities, organised by the CoR and the European Commission, where each year REGI marks its presence.
