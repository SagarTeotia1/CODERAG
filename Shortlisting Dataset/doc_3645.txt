Question for written answer E-004885/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (19 May 2011) Subject: Trading practices in the olive oil sector In point 4 of its answer to Written Question E‑000362/2011, the Commission states that it does not possess evidence of olive oil being sold with a composition that differs from that which is authorised. The Commission also states that under the relevant EU legislation, the Member States are responsible for applying and monitoring the rules concerned. As the serious crisis in Germany in January 2011 involving dioxins in animal feed showed, the internal market can be affected by any incidents that might occur. 1. Does the Commission think that the methods for testing olive oil should be the same in all EU Member States? 2. Does the Commission take the view that current testing methods are sophisticated enough to detect any possible adulteration?
