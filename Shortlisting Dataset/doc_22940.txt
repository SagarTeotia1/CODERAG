agricultural products for export destabilises local markets in developing countries; Fair international trade 34. Considers that the opening up of agricultural markets needs to be progressive, in accordance with the development progress of each individual developing country and based on socially fair and environmentally sound trade rules; notes that sensitive products that are basic needs for people in developing countries or of particular importance to food security and rural development in developing countries should be excluded from full liberalisation in order to prevent irreversible damage to local producers; stresses that the EU must promote a preferential and asymmetric system in trade negotiations with developing countries in order to allow them to keep certain supply-management and other development tools in their markets; points out that the least-developed countries have quota- and tariff-free market access to the EU, under the ´Everything But Arms" (EBA) agreement; 35. Stresses that, in current Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations, the Commission's priority must be to respond to the development needs expressed by African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries; recalls that, in order to meet this challenge, EPAs must be accompanied by the promised new funding for Aid for Trade (EUR 2 billion a year by 2010) and by the promotion of regional integration; 36. Stresses the need for a successful, balanced and fair outcome of the Doha Development Round; stresses that the results of the Doha Round should give positive incentives to the developing countries to invest in their agriculture and food production; invites the Commission to support proposals to include an action on staple food prices in the current WTO negotiation round; 37. Renews its call for the Commission and the Council to promote Fair Trade and other ethical schemes that contribute to raising social and environmental standards by supporting small and marginalised producers in developing countries, decreasing volatility and guaranteeing fairer prices and income, and encourages public authorities in the EU to integrate Fair Trade and sustainability criteria into their public tenders and purchasing policies; Promotion of democracy 38. Underlines that the current food crisis demonstrates the need to promote political stability, regional integration, democracy and human rights, not only within the EU, but also worldwide; calls, therefore, on all relevant stakeholders to promote human and democratic values and the rule of law when addressing the current food crisis and tackling long-term food security problems; o o o 39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the World Bank, the G8, the United Nations Secretary-General and the United Nations General Assembly, the Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the Pan-African Parliament (PAP).
