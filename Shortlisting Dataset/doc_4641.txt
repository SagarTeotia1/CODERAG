Question for written answer E-011644/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (9 December 2011) Subject: The Commission's advisory bodies The Commission establishes certain forms of expert groups to advise it. The Commission consults them when drafting legislative proposals and planning initiatives, political strategies and programmes, with regard to the interpretation and application of the European law currently in force. DG Internal Market and Services, for example, has adopted exactly the same approach, immediately establishing several such expert groups which are to give it expert advice in the fields of policy for which the Directorate-General is responsible. What criteria does the Commission apply in establishing such expert groups and in selecting the individual experts? Can the Commission confirm that these groups are completely independent?
