and do not need all this humanitarian aid. Do you foresee any change in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians now that a new US president has been elected? We hope so. He pledged during his campaign to pay attention to this issue if he won the elections! So we will all remind him of that. We hope that he will at least appoint someone of a very high level who will pay attention to this issue full time. We think that that’s important. What can the EU do to increase its contribution to the peace process in the Middle East? Talking about contributions, we always need more money (laughs). Of course, with the financial situation in the world we are worried about whether we are going to get more money next year. In terms of peace process, the EU and Europeans are seen as being balanced in the Middle East; they can speak to both parties and they can convey messages from both parties without being biased. We also think of Europeans as champions of human rights and international humanitarian law who are demanding these things from their partners, including us and the governments. We need an inclusive process, a principled one, which is based on rights, the rights of the Palestinians as well as the rights of the Israelis. We believe Europeans are well placed to be able to push that kind of approach and that's what we are appealing for.
