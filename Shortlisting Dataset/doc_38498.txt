steps to fight against the excesses of speculation on commodity markets; stresses that those steps should be taken as part of the efforts to regulate the financial markets at global and EU level; 23. Urges the G20 to coordinate the creation of preventive mechanisms against the excessive fluctuation of prices and to work towards regulation, specifically designed to tackle food and agricultural crises; calls on the G20 to ensure convergence of food and agricultural commodity regulation and to involve countries that are not part of the G20; asks for solutions to address excessive price volatility to be coordinated at international level; requests that abuses and manipulations of agricultural prices be fought at international level, as they potentially put at risk global food security; condemns the abusive activities of speculators in global commodities, agricultural raw materials and energy that accentuate the volatility of food prices and deepen the global food crisis; 24. Calls on the Commission to include adequate proposals in the upcoming reviews of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Market Abuse Directive to address the concerns in food and agricultural commodity markets; 25.

Considers that a targeted global system of decentralised regional and local food stocks (both emergency stocks to reduce hunger and regional stocks to be used to regulate commodity prices and to ease hunger in times of price spikes) would be beneficial, helping to facilitate world trade when price spikes occur, warding off recurring protectionism and easing the pressure on world food markets; considers that these stocks should be managed on the most appropriate levels, including by local, regional and national authorities and a coordination body under the aegis of the United Nations' FAO, making full use of the experience gathered by the FAO and the UN World Food Programme; Trade 29. Demands that EU negotiators integrate non-trade issues as part of WTO negotiations, so as to ensure that agricultural imports from third countries provide European consumers with the same guarantees in terms of environmental protection, animal welfare, food safety and quality as provided by EU farmers; reaffirms its support for a balanced and timely agreement to be
