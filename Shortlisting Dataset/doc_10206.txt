Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2011) In the framework of a TB eradication programme, approved by the Commission for the financial contribution from the Union, the financial contribution by the Union is set at 50 % of the costs incurred by each Member State for the compensation to owners for the value of their animals slaughtered, subject to an overall ceiling per programme. The maximum amount reimbursed to a Member State for the slaughter of an individual TB infected animal is EUR 375 per animal slaughtered. Information on the outcome of the UK 2010 programme has not yet been received by the Commission, but it was estimated that approximately 49500 TB reactor animals would be slaughtered in 2010. As regards the prohibition on TB cattle vaccination, EU and international (OIE World Organisation for Animal Health. ) rules on TB are based on current and historical knowledge of TB vaccines and diagnostic tests. Current rules do not allow the use of vaccines against TB in cattle mainly due to the interference with the only official test (skin test) and the suboptimal effectiveness of existing vaccines. If a candidate vaccine succeeds in showing scientifically sufficient protection and no interference with diagnostic tests, this vaccine might be an additional tool to accelerate TB eradication under certain circumstances. For this, EU and international (OIE) rules will need to be substantially amended.
