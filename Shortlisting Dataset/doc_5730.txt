Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (28 November 2011) The weighting of votes under the current criteria has been allocated by the Treaties based on the demographic size of the Member States (Protocol No 36 annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). At present, Member States which have between 3.3 and 5.5 million inhabitants have been allocated a number of seven votes (Lithuania, Ireland, Finland, Slovakia and Denmark). From 1 November 2014 onwards the voting system will be no more based on votes allocated to the members of the Council, but on a so-called double majority, defined in Article 16, paragraph 4 of the Treaty on European Union. It requires at least 55 % of the members of the Council, comprising at least 15 of them and representing Member States comprising at least 65 % of the population of the Union. This new system has been designed to cope with future enlargements.
