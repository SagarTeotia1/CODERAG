WRITTEN QUESTION E-0514/09 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (4 February 2009) Subject: Nabucco gas pipeline and Turkey During his recent visit to Brussels, speaking at a think-tank conference, Turkish Prime Minister Mr Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered a warning that Turkey might suspend its support for the Nabucco gas pipeline project unless the EU unblocked the Energy chapter of Turkey's EU accession talks. In response, Commission President Mr José Manuel Barroso said that European and Turkish energy security was too important to be held hostage by Turkey's EU membership bid. Is the Commission of the opinion that the Turkish Government has fully understood that the EU cannot be blackmailed by Turkey on this very important energy issue? And is the Commission satisfied that Turkey can provide sufficient guarantees that the Nabucco project will not be used by Turkey in order to blackmail the EU in any way? If such guarantees are not forthcoming and credible, will the Commission agree with me that alternative solutions must be found for the aforementioned gas pipeline?
