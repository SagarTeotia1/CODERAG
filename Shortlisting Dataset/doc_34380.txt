Question for written answer E-000036/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (24 January 2012) Subject: Revelations by Mesut Yilmaz concerning arson attacks on Greek forests and coup in Azerbaijan On 24 December 2011, the former Turkish Prime Minister openly admitted to the Turkish newspaper Birgün that secret state funds had been used to finance an attempted coup in Azerbaijan at least once, when Tanso Chiller was Prime Minister (1995‑97), and that Turkish agents had set fire to forests in Greece, causing incalculable damage. These revelations, which have now come from an official source, tally with information and disclosures such as those obtained from officers of the Grey Wolves sentenced on murder charges in Istanbul, who admitted before the Turkish courts that they had committed arson on Greek islands. Similar revelations have also been made in a book by the well-known Turkish journalist Emil Tsolasan. Given that one of the main preconditions for continuing negotiations between the EU and Turkey is improved relations between Turkey and its neighbours and that failure to investigate the above revelations will adversely affect them: What does the Commission know about these intermittent disclosures concerning arson attacks on Greek forests and a coup in Azerbaijan by Turkish state and parastate organisations? Will it call on Turkey to investigate the matter and initiate legal proceedings in order to throw light on secret state funding by the Turkish Government for acts of sabotage in other countries, including EU Member States?
