and adaptation needs from the EU should not be below EUR 30 000 million/year by 2020, a figure that may increase along with new knowledge on the severity of climate change and the scale of its costs; 19. Underlines that large financial flows for mitigation efforts and adaptation needs in developing countries are only part of the solution; insists that the money should be spent in a sustainable way, avoiding bureaucracy, in particular for SMEs, and corruption; stresses that the funding must be predictable, coordinated and transparent, building capacity within developing countries both at central and local level, giving priority to the people that face problems with climate change and not only the governments; stresses in this context the importance of continuous and easily accessible information on the funding available; calls on the Council and the upcoming Swedish Presidency to actively promote these principles during the UNFCCC COP15 negotiations in Copenhagen 2009; 20. Calls on the Commission to abandon its previous resistance to including forestry in emissions trading schemes; believes that both market and non-market based finance will be required to fund future 'Reducing Emissions for Deforestation and Degradation' (REDD) mechanisms under a post-2012 agreement; in this context calls on the Commission and Council to take the lead in developing pilot carbon markets for REDD; further calls on the Commission and Council to elaborate on how market and non-market based forestry funds could complement each other; 21. Believes that with the leadership of the EU in the provision of financial and technical support for developing countries, the chances of succeeding in the Copenhagen negotiations will improve considerably; believes that European leadership in the area of finance by providing concrete negotiating figures at an early stage is necessary in order to mobilise sufficient domestic public support, to encourage developing countries to adopt ambitious binding reduction targets, and to encourage other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to contribute in a similar manner; 22. Acknowledges the fact that the EU as a whole is on track to meet the Kyoto target but points out that some Member States are far away from their Kyoto target, which could undermine the credibility of the EU in the Copenhagen process; insists, therefore, that those Member States that are not already on track to meet the Kyoto target should intensify their activities; 23. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the European Council, the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the secretariat of UNFCCC with a request to the latter that it be forwarded to all contracting parties which are not EU Member States.
