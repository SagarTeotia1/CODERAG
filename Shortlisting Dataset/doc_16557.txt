Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2005) Female genital mutilation (FGM), sometimes referred to as female genital cutting or circumcision, is the most devastating but accepted cultural practice that affects women and girls. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 100 and 140 million women and girls have been subjected to this practice and that an additional two million girls are at risk of being subjected to it each year – about 5,500 genital mutilations per day. FGM is one of many inter-related sexual and reproductive health problems that the Community is committed to addressing as part of its policy for providing support for improvements in sexual and reproductive health in developing countries. The Regulation (EC) No 1567/2003 of the Parliament and Council of 15 July 2003 on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries OJ L 224, 6.9.2003 states that Community financial support shall be given to specific operations targeting the poorest and most vulnerable populations in both rural and urban areas, including those which aim to combat practices harmful to the sexual and reproductive health of women, such as FGM. This Regulation reflects the EU and its Member States’ commitment to the goals and objectives of the United Nations’ International Conference on Population and Development (IPCD) (Cairo, 1994) which were formally endorsed by the Community in 1996 Resolution on the follow-up to the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development, OJ C 211, 22.7.1996 . The Commission is committed to preventing suffering related to FGM, both in developing countries and in Europe. However, the Commission is not planning, at this stage, to present any new initiatives specifically on the issue of FGM. At EU-level, the Commission has financed a number of projects aimed at preventing FGM under the Daphne Programme to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk, which as from 2004 is in its second five-year phase until 2008 Decision No 803/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 adopting a programme of Community action (2004 to 2008) to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk (the Daphne programme), OJ L 143, 30.4.2004 . The Daphne II Programme is a programme of Community action aimed at preventing and combating all forms of violence, occurring in the public or the private domain, against children, young people and women by taking preventive measures and by providing support for victims and groups at risk, including in particular the prevention of future exposure to violence. It further aims to assist and encourage non governmental organisations and other organisations active in this field. Since its start in 1997, 24 projects concerning FGM have been co-financed under Daphne, including projects with the following aims: creation of a European Network for the Prevention of FGM in Europe (1st phase) and strengthening the Network by building on experiences and results from the
