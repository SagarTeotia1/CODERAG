of linking AfT with the EPA negotiation and its implementation; 60. Calls for a review of the existing AfT programmes of the Member States insofar as they concern EPA-related adjustments, so as to identify the most efficient mechanism for delivering effective support in the processing of EPA-related adjustments; 61. Stresses the urgency of getting to grips with the challenge of efficiently delivering effective AfT to ACP countries already engaged in preferential trade with the EU (for instance Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, which are half way through eliminating tariffs on trade with the EU); The Integrated Framework 62. Welcomes the recommendations of the IF Task Force and, in view of the commitment made by the WTO 2005 Ministerial Conference to operationalise the Enhanced IF by 31 December 2006; urges donors, and the EU in particular, to clarify their pledges so that the Enhanced IF can be immediately, adequately and predictably funded and effectively implemented as soon as possible; 63. Recalls that an Enhanced IF should become the key tool in assisting the LDCs in defining their needs in the area of trade through the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies, and should also become a substantial vehicle to assist the LDCs to mainstream trade into their national development plans and to improve their capacity to formulate, negotiate and implement trade policy; 64. Notes that the US$ 400 million of Indicative Costing for the Enhanced IF, based on the participation of 40 LDCs over a period of five years, would amount to an average of US$ 1-2 million per country per annum, which will be an improvement if effectively implemented but is nevertheless far from being a substantial response to existing challenges; 65. Calls for better coordination and coherence among various aid donors that reflect the proven competence of the agencies involved in delivering effective high-quality assistance in various AfT areas, as well as for more transparency regarding the aid allocated through trade-related assistance; insists, therefore, on the involvement of fully-fledged representatives of civil society and the private sector in the IF; 66. Notes the ambitious work program of the multi agency, ad-hoc consultative group on AfT; regrets, however, the lack of involvement of private sector, civil society and developing country representatives in this process; 67. Stresses that transparency in the delivery of aid and effective monitoring and evaluation are essential for building confidence in developing countries and for continual improvement in the quality of assistance given; 68. Requests the Commission to develop quantifiable criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of AfT; 69. Notes the General Affairs and External Relations Council's decision that AfT for EPAs will only cover trade policy and regulations and trade development activities; urges the Council and the Commission to clarify how other needs arising from EPAs, such as trade-related infrastructure, building productive capacity and trade-related adjustment, will be addressed; considers that the Council and the Commission should further consider the most appropriate mechanisms of delivery for different categories of support as regards EPAs; 70. Notes that women benefit less from the opportunities presented by trade liberalisation and globalisation, while at the
