WRITTEN QUESTION E-2243/08 by Ashley Mote (NI) to the Commission (21 April 2008) Subject: Fingerprinting innocent people Given that proven, reliable, tamper-proof technology does not exist, and that there is no prospect of its being available even for rigorous testing in the foreseeable future, and given the risks of data being misused or falling into the wrong hands, why is the EU continuing with plans to fingerprint everyone over the age of six? In any case, does the Commission not remember that, in Britain at least, the state answers to the people, not the people to the state? Does the Commission not agree, therefore, that the arbitrary fingerprinting of innocent people by the state is a clear breach of the British constitution?
