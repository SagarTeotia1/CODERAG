Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2012) 1. It is the Commission’s view that the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy and its headline targets are the best guarantee of restoring Europe's long-term growth prospects. It is for this reason that it has proposed concentrating ERDF investment on innovation, small businesses and energy efficiency and renewables. The amounts for energy efficiency and renewables are fixed reflecting targets set at European level. The Commission does not consider that it is necessary to set minimum amounts for SMEs, given the different circumstances prevailing across Member States. 2. The Commission considers that there is already considerable flexibility as regards the amounts for innovation and SMEs and that the regulatory proposals for the new period provide sufficient scope and flexibility to address real needs at both national and regional level.
