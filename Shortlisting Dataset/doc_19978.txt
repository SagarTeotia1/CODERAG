questions on how national authorities are addressing the issue of misleading forms. From the replies which have been received, it is abundantly clear that national authorities are aware of the problem of such misleading practices, have legislation in place to take action and where relevant, have already done so. It remains the Commission's firm intention to continue to raise the awareness about these types of misleading practices with business associations and to ensure that Member States — where relevant — take appropriate action. As far as the question of the extension of point 21 of Annex A (the ‘blacklist’) of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive Directive 2005/29/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC and 2002/65/EC of the Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive), OJ L 149, 11.6.2005. to business-to-business practices is concerned, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the recent reply to Written Question E‑1307/09 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . The Commission will now reflect on the course of action suggested in Parliament's resolution of 16 December 2008 Parliament resolution of 16 December 2008 on misleading directory companies (Petitions 0045/2006, 1476/2006, 0079/2003, 0819/2003, 1010/2005, 0052/2007, 0306/2007, 0444/2007, 0562/2007 and others) (2008/2126(INI)). , which should be equally relevant to the problem raised by the Honourable Member, and report back to the Parliament in due course on the follow-up it intends to give to it.
