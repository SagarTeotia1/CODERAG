Question for written answer E-006564/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Catherine Bearder (ALDE) (11 July 2011) Subject: Pan-European safety standards in water sports activities Following the death of a constituent whilst diving under the supervision of a registered Cypriot diving company in Cyprus last year, it has come to my attention that no basic minimum safety standards exist for companies operating in Member States and across borders providing water sports and other adventure activities to both EU and non-EU tourists. Cyprus is a prime example of the result of this lack of legislation. Upon contacting the Cyprus Federation of Underwater Activities (CFUA) the family of my constituent discovered not only that there are no minimum safety standards imposed on this industry in Cyprus, but also that another EU citizen died in very similar circumstances seven years earlier while diving with the same company. The company in question is still in operation, and continues to provide services to numerous European holidaymakers each year. In light of this case I wish to ask the Commission the following. 1. Why are such companies permitted to continue to operate without the introduction of specific safety regulations? 2. What plans does the Commission have to introduce a harmonisation of safety rules for diving and other water sports activities to protect tourists travelling to and between EU countries?
