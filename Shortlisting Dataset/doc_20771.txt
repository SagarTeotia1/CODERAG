Question for written answer E-001936/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Knut Fleckenstein (S&D) (3 March 2011) Subject: Abolition of the Light Aircraft Flight Instructor (LAFI) licence At the EASA conference in October 2010, the Commission advised the EASA to abolish completely the Light Aircraft Flight Instructor (LAFI) licence. The LAFI licence makes it possible for national teaching qualifications that do not fulfil the requirements of the full Flight Instructor (FI) licence to obtain the status of an EASA licence. National teaching qualifications, such as the German qualifications which can be used by Private Pilot Licence (PPL-N) instructors, in accordance with the regulation on flight crew, are no longer valid since licences have been standardised in the EU, and must be converted into an EASA licence. The PPL-N instructor’s qualification is a key component of training for beginners in flying clubs. The means of converting this teaching qualification into a valid EASA licence has until now been the LAFI licence, which entitles holders to give instruction for the Light Aircraft Pilot’s Licence (LAPL) on aircraft up to 2 000 kg. Can the Commission explain why it considers that the LAFI licence is superfluous? Can the Commission explain how national teaching qualifications that are below the full FI can in future attain the status of an EASA-compliant licence?
