Question for written answer E-8983/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Francesco Enrico Speroni (EFD) (28 October 2010) Subject: Former European Commissioners: monies and consultancy What monies are paid to former European Commissioners receive? Do they receive a monthly tax‑free amount as a pension? Are they entitled to other types of payment? If so, which? What is the justification for their receiving these amounts? Do these sums come from the EU budget or those of the Member States? Has the European Commission, now or in the past, assigned tasks or consultancy contracts to former Commissioners to perform in exchange for payment? On the basis of what criteria and/or needs were these tasks assigned? Is there a public list of these tasks that also specifies the amount paid for them and any other allowances that former Commissioners receive? Should such a list not exist, could the Commission please establish and publish one.
