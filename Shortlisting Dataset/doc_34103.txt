Reply (19 April 2010) The Council is aware of the case involving a Spanish and an Australian citizen to which the Honourable Member of the European Parliament refers. The Council fully supports the European Parliament's call on Israel to fulfil its obligations under international law and international humanitarian law and — regarding the individual cases of the involved persons of the incident in question — insists, together with the home countries of the EU and the other citizen, that all relevant provisions are correctly applied. The suggestion put forward by the Honourable Member to consider a suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel was addressed on a number of occasions by the Council: the Council maintains its view that the political process, as laid down in the Roadmap, represents the only route to achieving a negotiated two-State solution agreed between the parties which would result in an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian State existing side-by-side in peace and security with an Israel living within recognised and secure borders. A possible suspension of the EU‑Israel Association Agreement would not serve this objective.
