as the Commission cannot easily reshuffle the budget to other policy areas. 56. The new programmes (for which direct comparison to 2006 is not possible, and so the percentage column, in particular, must be viewed with some caution) are split as follows: Table 3 PDB 2007 Framework Programme /Other Programme /Agencies EUR % Fundamental rights and justice 71 510 000 12,5% Solidarity and management of migration flows 291 300 000 10,1% Security and safeguarding liberties 57 490 000 51,0% Other actions and programmes 78 400 000 13,7% Decentralised agencies 72 639 000 12,7% Total 571 339 000 100,0% Source: European Commission's PDB 2007 documents 57. As regards to the presentation of the PDB concerning the general programme " Solidarity and management of migration flows " it is confusing to note that EUR 60 million have been foreseen in PDB2007 for Budget line 18 03 03, although the new specific programme " European Refugee Fund " will take effect as of Budget 2008 only. The Pilot Schemes in Heading 3a 58 . According to the PDB document the three new framework programmes are replacing "a considerable number of smaller financial instruments and a series of preparatory actions and pilot projects " . Unfortunately it does not say which are the ones being absorbed by which specific programme.

It gets underway in 2007 with EUR 171,7 million in commitment appropriations (Budget line 02 04 01). Although being part of a Framework Programme, the objectives set out for security research in the FP7 proposal are to: · develop technologies and knowledge needed to ensure the security of citizens from threats such as terrorism and organised crime, while respecting fundamental human rights; · ensure the best use of available technologies in civil and defence-related areas; · stimulate the co-operation of providers and users in security solutions. Heading 3b: Citizenship 60. The PDB has overall commitment appropriations at EUR 603 million (-1.4%). Appropriations are thus broadly stable relative to B2006.
