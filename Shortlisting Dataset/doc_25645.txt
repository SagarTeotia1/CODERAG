Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (21 November 2006) The Commission is aware of the recent developments in Poso, including the shooting of the Reverend Kongkoli. It is following the situation closely. The Indonesian Police Chief has described the shooting of Reverend Kongkoli, as well as the recent acts of arson and attacks on the police, as terrorist acts. The Poso conflict is quite complex with culprits and victims found on all sides. For example, a day after the shooting of the Reverend Kongkoli, two Muslim traders were reported killed by an angry mob. In the Commission’s view, the government is doing its best to stop the violence, to find the perpetrators and ultimately to restore peace to the region. The government has set up a special Poso task force. The police have made some progress in identifying some of the perpetrators of the violence. The Commission supports the government in restoring peace. The Commission will continue to advocate moderation and respect for human rights in its ongoing dialogue with the Indonesian authorities.
