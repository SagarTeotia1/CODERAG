ORAL QUESTION H-0527/03 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Philip Claeys to the Council Subject: Food aid to Zimbabwe On 19 August 2003, the Zimbabwe Government requisitioned the food supplies held by aid organisations so that it might distribute the food itself. The aid organisations are very worried. The Mugabe regime has already been accused in the past of making the provision of food aid conditional upon political affiliation. Opponents receive nothing. At present, more than three million people in Zimbabwe are starving. Aid organisations fear that that figure will rise to five million by the end of the year. Land reform measures are likely to add to the problems. The Commercial Farmers' Union claims that 2 900 holdings (mainly farmed by whites) will have to close down. Press reports suggest that a large shipment of cereals from the EU is expected to arrive during the next few weeks. What measures are being taken to prevent that food aid from being misused for political purposes and to ensure that it reaches the needy?
