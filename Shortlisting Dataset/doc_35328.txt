life; supports the determination of the Commission and the Council to concentrate to a greater extent on growth and employment by increasing competitiveness, extending the internal market to the services sector, improving the efficiency of public services and consequently boosting domestic demand; 2. Stresses the importance of creating employment in the personal services and community services sector in a society of high female employment with an ageing and urbanised population; notes that aid to microenterprises and third-sector (voluntary and cooperative) enterprises is the most effective means of developing the relevant supply; 3. Regrets the excessively general nature of the integrated guidelines, which do not take sufficient account of the differences between Member States; encourages the Commission in its plan to submit a communication identifying the key challenges for each of the Member States, especially in the field of structural reforms and investments as well as for more rapid exchange of advanced knowledge in setting economic policy; 4. Recalls that a healthy macro-economic environment implies adequate interaction between coordinated budgetary policies, monetary policy that maintains on an equal footing the objective of price stability with the one of achieving the Union’s general goals as enshrined in the Treaty, in an effort to reach better living standards and the objectives of sustainable development; calls on the Member States to use the room for manoeuvre in the reformed Stability Pact to foster a more qualitative European economic growth; 5. Highlights the apparent contradiction between, on the one hand, the attraction exerted by the European model and the major role of the Union and of the Member States in world trade and, on the other hand, the dubious arguments presented in connection with the declining labour productivity growth trend; 6. Stresses the necessity to restructure economic policy focusing it on factors related to productivity growth, e.g. modernisation of economy, modernisation of knowledge and social welfare, modernisation of institutional arrangements to meet the challenges of new enlargement, requirements of modern economy and resist deflationary pressure of the third world; 7. Notes that increased labour productivity, growth and investments are prerequisites for higher wages and an equitable distribution of the fruits of growth and efforts to strengthen competitiveness, employment and social cohesion; stresses that such a development should be followed by an obligation for enterprises to meet their social responsibilities; 8. Is of the view that increased and sustainable growth in Europe requires simultaneous, coordinated action by all Member States, including improved internal market policy, intelligent, public investments, and innovative, active labour market reforms; 9. Regrets the conditions, in particular in terms of the timetable, under which Parliament is required to express an opinion on the integrated guidelines; calls for the conditions relating to interinstitutional cooperation on the integrated guidelines to be clarified before the European Council in June in order to prevent this situation being repeated, while taking into account the consequences of the revision of the Lisbon Strategy; 10. Calls on the Council to take account of the following modifications: Commission recommendation OJ C .., ... Modifications by Parliament Modification 1 Section A, Chapter A.1, paragraph
