WRITTEN QUESTION E-1695/05 by David Hammerstein Mintz (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (12 May 2005) Subject: Amendment of the decree requiring and regulating environmental impact assessments On 7 October 2004, the Government of the Balearic Islands published Decree No 85/2004 in its Official Journal, amending Decree 4/1986 requiring and regulating environmental impact assessments (EIA). This amendment is extremely worrying, insofar as it marks a step backwards with regard to environmental protection. It has very little real content, and fails to comply with either Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 . (amended by 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5 . ), or Royal Decree 1302/1986 transposing the EU directive (amended by Spanish Law 6/2001). Is the Commission aware of this amendment to the law, which undermines the provisions made in European and Spanish legislation on this issue? The decree in question likewise fails to safeguard the provisions of Directive 2001/42/EC OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p. 30 . on strategic environmental assessment, which Spain has not yet transposed into national legislation, something which should have been done by July 2004. How does the Commission view Spain’s failure to transpose the directive in due time? The amendment of Decree 4/1986 by Decree 85/2004 violates European legislation in two essential areas. Firstly, it makes the sole protagonists in drawing up the EIA those promoting the schemes, providing them with access to the documentation and reports, and allowing them to attend the meetings of the Assessment Committee, while Directive 2001/42/EC makes it perfectly clear that all possible transparency has to be guaranteed in the assessment of plans and schemes, a process in which the public must be consulted. Secondly, the amended decree elides the need to submit an EIA; this is in flat contradiction to both Directives (85/337/EEC and 2001/42/EC). The new wording means that virtually all construction work, schemes and plans can skip the hitherto obligatory EIA. This is set out in Annexes II and III, which allow most building work, schemes and plans to be exempted, in exchange for merely submitting a ‘Memorial Ambiental’ (Environmental Record) which is a simpler legal instrument lacking the requirements demanded by the EIA. Is the Commission aware of just how serious a situation is created by this legislative amendment, which clearly contravenes Community law? What measures will the Commission take to ensure that environmental legislation is complied with?
