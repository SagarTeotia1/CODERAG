ORAL QUESTION H-0209/04 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Yvonne Sandberg-Fries to the Commission Subject: The Commission's plan to improve, oversee and coordinate Romani affairs Capacity building is one of the key problems in improving the situation of the Roma in Europe. Up to this moment many EU projects targeting the Roma have failed to capacitate the Roma, as there has been no clear regulation on how to involve and train Roma in those projects, especially regarding managerial positions. It is impossible for Roma organisations to apply for tenders from the Commission. What is the Commission doing to address this issue? Is there a clear plan to properly coordinate and manage the activity of the Commission with regard to the Roma, as many projects initiated by different DGs have practically been overlapping in the past?
