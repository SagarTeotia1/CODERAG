Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (22 July 2008) The Commission regulation concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the telematics applications for the freight subsystem (TAF-TSI) of the trans-European conventional rail system was adopted on 23 December 2005 Commission Regulation (EC) No 62/2006 of 23 December 2005 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the telematic applications for freight subsystem of the trans-European conventional rail system (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 13, 18.1.2006. . This regulation is addressed to the rail industry which has the responsibility for its timely and correct implementation. To this end, the European representative bodies from the railway sector established by early 2007 a synchronised and comprehensive Strategic European Deployment Plan (SEDP) for TAF TSI which foresees its full implementation by 2013. The Commission, notably the Rail Transport and Interoperability Unit of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport, monitors the progress and evolution of this project. This implies, among other things, the participation at the meetings of the SEDP Management Board, the governing body involving rail stakeholders which oversees the implementation strategy and steers and monitors the deployment plan. As the Honourable Member correctly points out, this project is a key enabler to provide more efficient and competitive rail freight services. The Commission has recently stressed this requirement in its recent Communication on rail freight, giving priority to freight COM(2007)608 final. . With regard to involvement of the International Union of Railways (UIC) in this project, the Commission is evaluating the possible impact of latest developments on the side of this organisation on the project, including on the financial aid which was granted in the context of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) Programme.
