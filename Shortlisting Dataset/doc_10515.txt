Question for written answer E-006801/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (12 July 2011) Subject: Market in legal drugs dangerous to health For some months now, it has been possible to purchase legally, from Internet sites that are less than transparent, various types of drugs called ‘legal highs’ which are passed off as bath salts, plant food or research chemicals, but are in fact ingested by the purchaser to obtain effects similar to those produced by illegal hard drugs. A toxicologist from the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom has discovered that the majority of these goods on sale online contain illegal substances that are dangerous to health but are not mentioned on the product’s label. An analysis of the composition of seven of these products revealed that six of them contained ingredients other than those stated, while five contained substances dangerous to health, such as benzylpiperazine or derivatives thereof, combined with caffeine. A recent report by the ‘Centers for Disease Control’ in Atlanta stated that between 13 November 2010 and 31 March 2011, there were 35 serious cases of intoxication caused by ingestion or inhalation of products sold online as ‘bath salts’, but which in reality contained synthetic drugs, in the State of Michigan. In light of the above, how will the Commission stop this market in legal drugs from becoming, in reality, a cover for the sale of illegal and dangerous substances, and make consumers aware of the dangers they face in taking substances of this kind?
