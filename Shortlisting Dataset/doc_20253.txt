11. Believes that such commitments on financing should include, as provided for by the European Council in December 2008, a pledge by Member States to use a significant part of the auctioning revenues generated by the EU ETS to finance actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing countries which will have ratified the international agreement, but stresses that as less than 50% of EU emissions are covered by emission trading it is necessary to include other sectors of the economy in the Member States, when it comes to the effort of financing these important actions; 12. Insists that such commitments provide for predictable financing for mechanisms set up in the UNFCCC context which are additional to ODA and independent from annual budgetary procedures in the Member States; 13. Welcomes the Commission idea that part of the finance should be given in the form of loans because some activities can create a 'win-win' situation also in developing countries; 14. Underlines that binding targets would enable investors to better assess the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and would involve investors in projects that would meet mitigation as well as adaptation targets; underlines furthermore the need for clarity regarding the role of private capital in the investments necessary in order to reach the targets; 15. Considers it, however, of utmost importance to adopt a more comprehensive action plan on the future financing of climate policy, which would cover all relevant areas and sources of financing; considers the above-mentioned Commission Communication of 28 January 2009 as a good starting point for that work, but stresses that it must be strengthened with clearly defined measures; calls on the European Council to mandate the Commission to urgently develop such an action plan in view of the Copenhagen negotiations; 16. Believes that a large part of the collective contribution towards the mitigation efforts and adaptation needs of developing countries must be dedicated to projects striving to halt deforestation and forest degradation, and to reforestation and afforestation projects in such countries; 17. Welcomes the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as a possible way to enable developing countries to participate in the carbon market; underlines that the use of offsets to meet emission reduction targets by industrialised nations cannot be part of the responsibility of developing countries to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions in an international agreement on climate change; insists therefore that stringent project quality criteria must be part of future offsetting mechanisms to avoid industrialised nations taking away the low-cost reduction options from developing countries, and in addition guarantee the high standard of such projects, with reliable, verifiable and real emission reductions that also provide for a sustainable development in such countries; 18. Considers that the collective contribution towards developing country mitigation efforts and adaptation needs from the EU should not be below EUR 30 000 million/year by 2020, a figure that may increase along with new knowledge on the severity of climate change and the scale of its costs; 19. Underlines that large financial flows for mitigation efforts and adaptation needs in
