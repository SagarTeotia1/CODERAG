MEPs will vote on a resolution in May. The visa waiver program allows citizens of certain countries deemed by the US authorities to present a low security risk to travel to the USA for up to 90 days without having to obtain a visa. These countries include all those that were EU Member States before 2004 (except Greece) plus Slovenia. All the other "new" Member States are excluded from the program. However, some of these states (Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia) have recently signed bilateral agreements with the US enabling them to be admitted to the program. The European Commission has argued that, in this area, differential treatment by the USA of individual EU Member States conflicts with EU law, since some points of the accords come under Community legislation, notably transfers of "passenger name records". On 12-13 March the EU troika proposed a dual approach: matters coming under national law would be dealt with by national authorities while those falling under Community law would be negotiated by the Commission. The Council (Coreper) then agreed on a draft mandate to allow the Commission to negotiate an overall agreement with the US at the US-EU summit of 12 June.
