their comparative advantages; - the need for special and differential treatment provisions for developing countries in trade agreements to be effectively targeted and transparent; - the lack of capacity in ICT, which prevents developing countries from making full use of the opportunities offered by these technologies in terms of eCommerce, marketing, etc.; 3. Welcomes the new regulation on Generalised Tariff Preferences, in particular the widening of product coverage, the greater simplicity, and the increase in tariff preferences; regrets, however, that the criteria to justify temporary withdrawal have been extended and that more stringent requirements have been set which mean that developing countries wishing to benefit from extra preferences under the special incentive arrangements now face additional difficulties in order to benefit from them; 4. Advocates, in this regard, the strengthening of special and differential treatment of specific countries and regions to enhance their rural businesses and help SMEs to develop high value-added products that meet the requirements of northern markets and which should only cease when real results have been achieved; 5. Points out that economic development does not have to take place on the basis of a completely open, liberalised, 'laissez faire' market logic, many instances of successful development having been based on promoting local producers, manufacturers and industries; 6. Takes the view that the private sector, which bears both social and ecological responsibility, can contribute to sustainable development and the eradication of poverty; stresses, further, that the developing countries have a responsibility to adopt appropriate rules to protect and develop their own industries and to open up their markets on a selective basis, in a manner consistent with their economic circumstances, without, however, undermining the local private sector; 7. Notes the wide discrepancies which exist in terms of human and institutional capacity between the EU and developing countries, and considers that capacity-building and technical assistance must be essential elements in all future development, economic cooperation and trade arrangements between the EU and developing countries; 8. Insists that trade policies oriented towards the reduction of poverty, promotion of employment, creation of wealth and overall economic, social and cultural development must be matched by development policies which are supportive of competitive supply capacity, in order to enable developing countries to exploit market opportunities; considers that capacity-building must be accompanied by transfers of technology and investment, as well as the establishment of national policies in favour of the poor (elementary teaching and healthcare, creation of jobs, land reforms, emancipation of women, and others); 9. Considers that fundamental institutional changes should be promoted in developing countries and must include building capacity for the provision of: technical assistance, bodies which encourage social reforms (such as agrarian reform) legal security, measures to combat corruption,protection of property ownership and rights, properly functioning courts (particularly for small claims) access to justice, a banking network with easy access to opening bank and savings accounts for small account holders, the empowerment of SMEs through the easy formation of limited liability companies, limited partnerships, accounting, auditing and bookkeeping functions, the availability of incubator, micro-credit, venture, and development capital and loans, the
