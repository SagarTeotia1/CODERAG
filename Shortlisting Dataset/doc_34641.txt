WRITTEN QUESTION E-6707/08 by Sylwester Chruszcz (NI) to the Commission (16 December 2008) Subject: Glorification of a Nazi military unit I should like to draw the Commission's attention to events involving the promotion of Nazi ideology and the glorification of a Waffen SS unit in Ukraine. In July 2008, in the vicinity of the town of Brody (Mount Żbyr) in Ukraine, a further monument to the murderous ‘Galicia’ Division of the Nazi Waffen SS was unveiled. A similar monument glorifying SS soldiers is already to be found in Lviv cemetery. It is absolutely scandalous that in the 21st century, at a time of reconciliation among peoples, a group of people with openly nationalist and fascist sympathies can glorify a criminal military unit responsible for the death of millions of Europeans, including Poles. It should be remembered that the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg declared the SS a criminal organisation. Does the glorification — unhindered by the law — of a criminal organisation count among the ‘common values’ on which the EU‑Ukraine partnership is supposed to be based? What action does the Commission intend to take in this matter?
