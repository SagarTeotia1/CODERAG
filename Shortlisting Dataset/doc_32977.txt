Answer given by Mr Figel' on behalf of the Commission (14 May 2008) The Honourable Member will be aware that in accordance with Article 149 of the EC Treaty the responsibility for the content and organisation of education and training systems rests with Member States. The right of parents to ensure the education of their children in conformity with their religious, philosophical and pedagogical convictions must be implemented in that context. It is thus for each Member State to decide the arrangements concerning private schools. These arrangements vary considerably country by country, but descriptions can be found at Eurydice database at www.eurydice.org According to the Eurydice Key Data on Education in Europe (2005) a great majority of students in European countries attend public institutions. Attendance at government-dependent private institutions is most common in Belgium and the Netherlands, and also in the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Malta. Independent private education accounts on average for only 2.5 % of enrolments, the highest percentages being in Portugal, Malta, Cyprus and Greece.
