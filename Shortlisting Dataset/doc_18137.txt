Reply (25 March 2011) The Honourable Member has correctly pointed out that the European Union has limited competence in the field of integration and that integration of third-country nationals takes place at national, regional and local level. The Council and the Member States have, however, developed a framework for better coordination of national integration policies. This framework is based on Common Basic Principles for Immigrant Integration Policy in the European Union, established at the meeting of the Council of the European Union and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on 19 November 2004, which adopted Council Conclusions on Immigrant Integration Policy in the European Union 14615/04 (Presse 321). . The Common Basic Principles refer to the values of the European Union, employment, the acquisition of basic knowledge of the host society's language, history and institutions, efforts in education, access for immigrants to institutions, goods and services on a basis equal to national citizens and in a non-discriminatory way, frequent interaction between immigrants and Member State citizens, the practice of diverse cultures and religions, which is guaranteed under the Charter of Fundamental Rights and must be safeguarded, the participation of immigrants in the democratic process and in the formulation of integration policies and measures as key elements of the integration process. The Common Basic Principles have served as the basis for further work, including, most recently, the Conclusions of the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on Integration as a Driver for Development and Social Cohesion 9248/10. , adopted by the Council on 3-4 June 2010. In these conclusions particular attention was given to education and employment of migrants. Previously, in their Conclusions on Strengthening of Integration Policies in the European Union 10267/07 (Presse 125). , adopted on 12-13 June 2007, the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States had recognised that intercultural dialogue has become an important instrument in fostering the successful integration of citizens of different origins, cultures and religions in Europe. The Council does not, however, collect information on concrete measures Member States take to improve integration at national level. Concerning the question on the integration of immigrants into the labour market, the Europe 2020 Strategy COM(2010) 2020 final, 3.3.2010. headline target of aiming to raise to 75 % the employment rate of the population aged 20-64 implies better integration of legal migrants in the work force. This objective is also mentioned in the European Council Conclusions of June 2010 EUCO 13/1/10, 17 June 2010. . Among the major tools to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy are the Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, adopted by the Council on 21 October 2010 Council Decision of 21 October 2010 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (OJ L 308, 24.11.2010, p. 46). . These guidelines list a number of measures that can be useful in order to integrate legal migrants, among other vulnerable groups, in the labour market Idem. Recital 11, Guideline 7. . In particular, within the open method of coordination, the
