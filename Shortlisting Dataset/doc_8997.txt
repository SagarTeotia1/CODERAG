Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (30 November 2010) The Commission, in close cooperation with EU Member States diplomatic representations in Bahrain, continues to follow closely the case of the arrested activists. A group of 23 clerics, human rights activists and representatives from the opposition were arrested before the parliamentary elections, accused of allegedly plotting to overthrow the government. The Commission recalls Bahrain’s international obligations under the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to ensure fair and transparent trials for all those concerned. In the particular case of the Swedish citizen, the Commission is in contact with the relevant Member State regarding his situation and that of his family. More broadly, the Commission takes this opportunity to reaffirm the priority that EU attaches to the global eradication of torture and to the full rehabilitation of torture victims.
