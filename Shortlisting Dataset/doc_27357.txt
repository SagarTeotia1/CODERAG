Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (3 October 2011) On the 22 December 2010, the Commission adopted a report COM(2010)783 final. on ‘The memory of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe’. In its report the Commission underlined the importance of keeping the memory alive of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes. The Commission considers that it is important to address knowledge gaps concerning the totalitarian past of all Member States, and especially concerning the period of time in which Eastern and Western Europe have lived two different experiences. The report explains that the Commission is ready to use its financial programmes to assist interested parties to support and promote the memory of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes and presents the most relevant EU programmes in that respect. Action 4 ‘Active European Remembrance’ http://ec.europa.eu/citizenship/programme-actions/doc48_en.htm within the Europe for Citizens Programme provides financial support for activities with the aim to preserve the memory of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism in order to develop a European perspective on the causes and consequences of these phenomena. The European Commission is not aware of any plan to develop a memorial and a historical exhibition on the issues mentioned by the Honourable Member.
