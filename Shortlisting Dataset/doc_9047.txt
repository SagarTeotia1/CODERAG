Question for written answer E-8689/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Frieda Brepoels (Verts/ALE) (26 October 2010) Subject: Problems with the interpretation of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 for people in receipt of two pensions Further to my Questions E‑6178/2010 and E‑4552/2010, I should like to put to the Commission the following two specific problems with Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 affecting people in receipt of two pensions. 1. Since Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 entered into force on 1 May 2010, the Dutch authorities have adhered to the following position: if a retired frontier worker waives his entitlement to AOW (general old age) pension in the Netherlands, the Dutch authorities no longer consider the Netherlands to be financially liable for him and it is assumed that another Member State (in this case Belgium) will assume liability for the person’s medical expenses. As a result of this position on the part of the Netherlands, if a retired person waives his entitlement to AOW pension, another Member State has to pay for medical care. Moreover, this position may also affect pensions and other fields of social security. Does this position not undermine the neutrality of the assignment rules of the Member State which is financially liable for medical provision, and more particularly the application of Articles 23 to 26 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, and most of all, Article 23? I understand that the Belgian RIZIV and also the competent authority in Germany are for the time being refusing to accept the Netherlands’ reasoning. 2. Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 lays down that the rules of the State of residence apply to people in receipt of two pensions. However, frontier workers living in the Netherlands who in addition to their Dutch AOW pension receive a Belgian pension have to pay a solidarity contribution to the Belgian pension administration. In this context I should like to put the following specific questions to the Commissioner: 1. Does the Commission endorse the interpretation of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 by the Dutch authorities as regards the health insurance of people in receipt of two pensions? If so, why? If not, why not? What steps will the Commission take to solve this problem? 2. How does the Commission classify this solidarity contribution? Is it a levy or a tax? Does it accord with Regulation (EC) No 883/2004?
