Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (19 April 2011) As mentioned on the Commission's answer to Written Question E‑10260/10 by Mr Papastamkos and Mr Poupakis http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/home.do?language=EN , the Commission is aware of the public consultation that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) launched in December 2010 concerning the review of EU rules in the field of Flight Time Limitations (FTL). The existence of different levels of requirements in Member States regarding FTL is also known to the Commission. The EASA's public consultation is just one of the first stages of the regulatory process, aimed precisely at gathering the views and supporting evidence of all stakeholders. During 2011, EASA will review the comments to the consultation, collect detailed scientific advice and present draft implementing rules, in the form of an opinion, to the Commission. Based on the EASA's opinion, the Commission will adopt appropriate legislation through comitology (regulatory procedure with scrutiny).
