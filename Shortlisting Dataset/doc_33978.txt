Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2012) By 30 November 2011, the following amounts had been paid to the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) demonstration projects financed under the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR): (a) Jaenschwalde in Germany: EUR 57 886 006.08 incuding EUR 45 million in pre-financing (b) Porto Tolle in Italy: EUR 30 986 829.17 incuding EUR 25 million in pre-financing (c) Rotterdam in the Netherlands: EUR 53 452 648.15 incuding EUR 45 million in pre-financing (d) Bełchatów in Poland: EUR 55 232 290.31 incuding EUR 45 million in pre-financing (e) Compostilla in Spain: EUR 117 288 368 incuding EUR 45 million in pre-financing (f) Don Valley in the UK: EUR 59 341 492.24 incuding EUR 45 million in pre-financing The total EU financial commitments were encoded per project when the contracts were signed. The timeframe for claiming costs is limited to the contractually agreed duration which varies per project. None of the contracts has a lifetime of more than 5 years and none goes beyond 2015. The Commission is closely following the implementation of the projects through periodic reports and review meetings. To date, only the project in Jaenschwalde is unable to meet the requirements under the EEPR. No additional CCS project has been added since the list of projects to be funded was adopted in 2009.
