Question for written answer E-001135/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (14 February 2011) Subject: Failing to meet EU bioenergy targets Some bioenergies are criticised because their production can mean competing for land with food production or their ecological and economic benefit is limited. For 2020 the EU has set itself the target of producing a third of electricity and a tenth of fuels from sustainable sources, so that one fifth of European energy consumption is supplied from hydro, solar, wind or biomass. According to Energy Commissioner Oettinger, while some Member States have fulfilled or more than fulfilled the plan, the EU as a whole cannot meet these targets. In this connection the retroactive cut in subsidies being planned in some Member States if generation costs fall rapidly is also causing problems. According to statistics from the European wind energy company Ewea, in 2010 51 % of the new capacities were gained from gas power stations and for the first time since 1998 more new coal power stations were opened than old ones were closed. By comparison, only 17 % of the new plants were producing energy from wind power. 1. What steps is the Commission taking to secure legal and planning certainty for the producers of renewable energies as regards subsidies (feed-in tariffs)? 2. Are there plans to reorientate EU support measures so as to improve fulfilment of the aim of increasing the share of renewable energies? 3. In this connection are there plans for a transfer of funding from Euratom to bioenergies? 4. What is the Commission’s position on the problems raised by the competition for land between food production and bioenergy?
