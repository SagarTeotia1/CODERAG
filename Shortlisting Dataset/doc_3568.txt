The Commission proposal would amend the existing Directive 92/3 Euratom. It seeks to modify terms and definitions, address new situations and ensure consistency with other Community and international texts. It does not significantly alter the existing prior authorisation system but clarifies procedures, for example for Member States to consent to, or refuse to allow, shipments of waste and fuel into their territory. The committee's amendments seek to improve the new procedure for acknowledging receipt of applications for shipments. It wants to tackle the issue of liability for costs arising when the shipment cannot be completed. And it wishes to make it absolutely clear that any country has the right to ban imports both of radioactive waste for final treatment (except in the case of reshipment) and foreign spent fuel for final disposal.

The own-initiative report, drafted by Joan CALABUIG RULL (PES, ES), welcomes a Commission paper which sets out a policy framework and an enhanced work programme for the EU's manufacturing industries as part of the Lisbon agenda. An EU policy to face up to globalisation It says the EU " must aspire to remain a major industrial power and not merely confine itself to developing the services sector ". A " coherent industrial policy at European level" is needed, in particular "to tackle the challenges of globalisation ". The draft report is concerned at the preponderance in the EU of industries with medium-high technologies and low-to-intermediate labour skills. It says education and training are crucial and believes the Commission's paper does not pay enough attention to these areas. It urges the Member States to attract more young students into technical and scientific studies and it emphasises the " major potential of nano-sciences and nano-technologies ". Imports to be monitored more rigorously The Commission is urged
