Question for written answer E-7674/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (28 September 2010) Subject: Tunisia — amendment of Criminal Code I should like to bring to the Commission's attention a question concerning the new amendments to the Tunisian Criminal Code, which threaten to undermine and impede the proper protection of human rights. A new law has been passed amending Article 61(a) of the Criminal Code by adding a punishment provision for individuals who, directly or indirectly, have contacts with agents, institutions or organisations from foreign countries who might encourage them to influence decision-making in Tunisia and its economic security. In practice, this amendment allows human rights defenders, who constantly cooperate with many foreign operators, including the EU and the United Nations, to be arrested and persecuted. And it is a well-known fact that full respect for freedom of expression and association is one of the pillars of these multilateral organisations. All this is clearly an obstacle to respect for human rights and could indeed lead to increased persecution of those who defend human rights. I would also stress that since the adoption of the EU‑Tunisia Action Plan, Tunisia has not taken any steps to promote human rights, as already reported by the Commission in its 2009 ‘European Neighbourhood Policy’ document. 1. Is the Commission aware of this amendment to the Tunisian Criminal Code and of what its consequences might be? 2. What policies will it adopt to protect human rights and the safety of those who defend them?
