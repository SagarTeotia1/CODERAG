WRITTEN QUESTION P-4489/08 by Anne Ferreira (PSE) to the Commission (30 July 2008) Subject: Dangers posed by the Red Bull energy drink Sales of the original version of the Red Bull energy drink have been banned in France owing to the presence of two ingredients — taurine and D-glucuronolactone — which have been shown to have neurotoxic effects on and to cause kidney damage in rats. On the basis of the precautionary principle, the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) therefore made it clear that the product in question could not be regarded as safe for human consumption. Nevertheless, it can still be marketed in the other EU countries, with the exception of Denmark. Invoking the principle of the free movement of goods, the firm which produces the drink is putting pressure on France to allow it to be marketed there. Given the scientific data available, does the Commission not take the view that there is in fact a case for referring the matter to the European Food Safety Authority so that a more thoroughgoing analysis can be carried out, with the aim of determining whether the product is safe, and, possibly, for suspending sales of the product whilst the necessary studies are conducted? In addition, pending such clarification should attention not be drawn, by means of specific, clear labelling, to the potential dangers of consuming this product? The issue at stake here is the protection of consumers’ health, which the Commission must make an absolute priority, in particular as regards minors, pregnant women and all other vulnerable individuals.
