therefore more critical for old two-stroke vehicles which emit much more Hydrocarbons and particulate matters. However, their emissions can be greatly improved by using synthetic oil instead of mineral oil for the engine. That is the reason why the Commission supported the awareness campaign promoting the use of synthetic oil launched by ACEM (Motorcycle Manufacturers Association) and FEMA (Motorcycle Users Association). The Commission plans to revise the legislation on two and three-wheel motor vehicles. A study was launched at the beginning of 2008 to review the conclusions of the study of 2004 (mentioned above) taking into account the latest development of technology. The result of this study should be available by the end of 2008, while the planning for the new legislation to be approved by the Commission is 2009.
