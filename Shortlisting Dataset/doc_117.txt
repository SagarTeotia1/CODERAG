Question for written answer E-012315/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (4 January 2012) Subject: Economic crisis in Croatia The new Croatian Prime Minister, Zoran Milanović, has been quoted in the press as saying that the only way for Croatia to overcome the crisis is to put its public finances in order and bring about economic growth. A World Bank report predicts that Croatia will go into recession in 2012 and that its GDP will decline by about 1 %, having risen this year, according to estimates, by a modest 0.5 points. Now that Europe as a whole is undergoing a severe financial crisis, does not the Commission think that this is the wrong time for a country that will be in recession to join the EU, as European budgets will have to bear the additional burden imposed by the expenditure needed to bring another eastern European economy into line with the other Member States?
