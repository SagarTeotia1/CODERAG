Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (10 February 2006) Following assessment of the information made available to the Commission in relation to this project, the construction of a motorway through the Tara‑Skyrne valley in County Meath, it was not possible to establish that a breach of EU legislation had occurred. On this basis, the decision was taken that the complaints be closed.
