Answer given by Mr Patten on behalf of the Commission (16 May 2003) The current legal instruments at the Commission's disposal make no provision for Community action in situations similar to those described in the written question. The Commission will transmit a copy of the written question and the corresponding Commission reply to the Mission of the Holy See to the Union Institutions for its information and follow-up as appropriate.
