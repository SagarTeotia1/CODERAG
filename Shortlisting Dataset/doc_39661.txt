Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (23 October 2009) With respect to the specific Spanish tax provision for expatriates referred to by the Honourable Member (taxation at a flat 24 % rate on income from Spanish sources without deduction of expenses or allowances in the tax year of moving to Spain and the following five tax years), it must be noted that it is not restricted to foreign football players but applies to all individuals that move to Spain to work there, provided they have not been resident in Spain in the past 10 years and some other general conditions have been met. It is indeed true that Article 12 as well as Article 39 of the EC Treaty prohibit discrimination of individuals on the grounds of nationality. However, in the present state of EC law these non-discrimination provisions are understood to prevent discrimination by one Member State against the nationals of another Member State. They do not cover discrimination against own nationals. Moreover, there is no EU case-law principle stating that income tax should be levied on a progressive scale. Income tax base and rate are to be established by the Member States respecting the aforementioned non-discrimination provisions. Also, under the existing Code of Conduct for business taxation, the said provision cannot be considered harmful tax competition. The scope of the Code of Conduct is currently limited to business tax and does not therefore include employee taxation. Finally, only measures applying to undertakings are covered by the ban on state aid of Article 87 of the EC Treaty, whereas the beneficiaries in the Spanish measure in question are employed individuals. The Commission therefore considers that there is no legal basis to take action and accordingly does not currently intend to take action against Spain on this issue.
