Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (12 February 2009) The Honourable Member inquires about the specific requirements under the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Habitats and Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directives that relevant national authorities should apply in the authorisation of the above project. The Commission maintains the position stated in its replies to Written Questions E‑0752/07 and E‑3503/07 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . According to the information made available to the Commission by the Honourable Member, the competent national authorities have not taken any decision on the project yet. It would therefore be inappropriate for the Commission to take action at this stage by contacting the Italian authorities. As previously stated, if the project were eventually authorised, the Commission would be willing to further investigate the matter in order check compliance with the above requirements.
