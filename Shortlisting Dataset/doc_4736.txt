WRITTEN QUESTION E-1649/04 by Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Torbiere del Sebino Nature Reserve (Brescia) — The Torbiere del Sebino Nature Reserve (Brescia) was set up by Regional Law No 86 of 30 November 1983, Decision GR No 1846 of 19 December 1984. The Nature Reserve’s first management plan was approved by Decision No 35842 of 13 September 1988. — The EU has declared the Torbiere (peat bogs) a site of Community interest (SCI), a special protection area (SPA) and an important bird area (IBA), as well as an integral part of the network of European protected areas known as Natura 2000; the National Research Council designated the area a ‘biotope of exceptional importance’ in 1970 and the Torbiere were declared a ‘site of international interest for migratory birds’ under the Ramsar Convention. — The area has received funding from the European Community through the LIFE Natura programme and other Community funding through Agenda 21 initiatives. — The municipal authorities of the town of Corte Franca, through Decision No 59 of 29 October 2003, have proposed a variant allowing the possibility of building a huge car park with 1300 — 1500 spaces for cars and 3000 m3 of new reception/tourist facilities in the middle of the protected area and a few metres from the edge of the Nature Reserve. — The municipal authorities of the town of Provaglio d’Iseo, through Decision C.C. No 6 of 18 February 2004, have proposed a variant, after having put right an abuse, in the middle of zone B (Zumbo area) and therefore within the area of the Torbiere, providing for meeting rooms, restaurants, tourist offices, shops, premises for associations, a picnic area and lodgings for the park keeper. — The municipal authorities of the town of Iseo, through Decision No 5 of 26 February 2004, have adopted a lotting plan for the area of Supersolaio allowing the possibility of creating 11000 m3 of reception/accommodation facilities. This area is adjacent to zone A, the most protected area of the Nature Reserve — with some parts of it being actually inside the zone — and runs along the shore of the lake. Until a few years ago, it was well protected. — All these local authority decisions are subject to approval by the Lombardy regional authorities. What urgent initiatives does the Commission intend to take to ensure respect for Community rules in the Torbiere del Sebino? Does the Commission intend to approach the Lombardy regional authorities with a view to ensuring that they reject the variants adopted by the municipal councils of Provaglio d’Iseo and Corte Franca and block the Iseo municipal authorities’ lotting plan?
