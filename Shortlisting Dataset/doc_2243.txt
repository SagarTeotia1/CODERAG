WRITTEN QUESTION E-4057/05 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Council (7 November 2005) Subject: Early retirement scheme for officials During the summer it came to light that around 340 European officials will have to make way for new colleagues from the new Member States. In this connection, early retirement arrangements in particular have caused quite a storm. The officials concerned apparently include some who are eligible to receive a monthly pension of EUR 9000 upon reaching the age of 50. The reports about these measures to replace officials and the numerous emails which I have received on the subject have given, and continue to give, the European Union and its institutions an extremely bad press. The uncertainty surrounding this subject is especially damaging to a Union already under fire. In order to be able to provide correct information to citizens, I wish to ask: Is the Council prepared to provide me with a detailed indication of the number of officials concerned and the precise terms on which they may retire early? Could the Council indicate whether, and above all how, it intends to carry out the replacement of staff in future? Finally, what action will the Council be taking in order to adequately and, above all, correctly inform European citizens of decisions like this one — if legitimate?
