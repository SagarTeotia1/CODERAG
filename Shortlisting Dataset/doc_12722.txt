Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (10 January 2011) 1. As a consequence of the regulation to which the Honourable Member is referring Commission Regulation (EC) No 244/2009 of 18 March 2009 implementing Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to ecodesign requirements for non-directional household lamps, OJ L 76, 24.3.2009. , EU citizens are expected to save close to 40 billion kilowatt-hours (roughly the electricity consumption of 11 million European households, or the equivalent of the yearly output of 10 power stations of 500 megawatts). For a typical compact fluorescent lamp, the initial difference in the lamp price should be paid back on average within 8 months Based on the assumption of a 60W conventional incandescent bulb costing EUR 0.60 versus a 15W compact fluorescent lamp costing EUR 4.50, 3 continuous burning hours per day, for an energy cost of EUR 0.136 /kWh. . 2. The regulation is directly applicable in all Member States. Unfortunately the Commission has no information about the pace of implementation in the various Member States. However, the Commission is aware of the fact that the governments of the United Kingdom and France concluded voluntary agreements with the retail sector to start gradually removing incandescent bulbs about a year ahead of the schedule set out in the regulation. 3. Improved incandescent bulbs with halogen technology are largely produced in the EU. However compact fluorescent bulbs and LED bulbs are mainly manufactured outside the EU, mostly in China and India. More details can be found in Annex VI of the Commission's impact assessment related to Regulation (EC) No 244/2009 SEC(2009)327 final, available from: http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/ia_carried_out/docs/ia_2009/sec_2009_0327_en.pdf . 4. When preparing the regulation, particular attention was paid to correct preparation of a phase-out calendar allowing the industry to adapt their production lines (in particular for switching from incandescent bulbs to their direct replacements, efficient halogen bulbs, which can be produced on the adapted lines). Nonetheless, already in the impact assessment it was estimated that in the worst case about 2 000-3 000 lay-offs could potentially occur across the EU as a direct result of the regulation (out of a workforce of 50 000 people employed in lamp production). At the same time it is also expected to the regulation should contribute to the EU economy by reinjecting about EUR 5-10 billion through electricity savings, which should lead to the creation of jobs in other sectors of the economy More details can be found in section IV.1.a of the impact assessment referred to above. .
