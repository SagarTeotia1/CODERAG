Question for written answer E-006573/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nicole Sinclaire (NI) (11 July 2011) Subject: Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Can the Commission say whether any EU funding has been given to Argentine human rights group, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo? If so, what kind of guarantees or accountability has been put in place to prevent misuse of public money? The organisation is being investigated by the Argentine authorities on counts of money-laundering and fraud. Will the Commission assure me that this matter will be kept under close review and, if necessary, that a full investigation will be undertaken?
