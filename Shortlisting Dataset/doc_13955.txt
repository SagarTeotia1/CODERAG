Answer given by M Kallas on behalf of the Commission (19 January 2011) When introducing tolls or time based charges (vignettes) for passenger cars, Member States have to respect the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Notably, they have to ensure that the imposition of tolls and charges does not discriminate, directly or indirectly, among road users depending on their nationality or place of residence. However, there is no secondary EU legislation that specifies rules for charging passenger cars. The decision to set fees to be paid by cars when using roads is the responsibility of the Member States concerned, as is the care for traffic rules, marking and sanctions. Austria applies a ‘vignette’ system for passenger cars and motorcycles. The ‘vignettes’ are available to road users inside and outside Austria in a way that the Commission, on the basis of available information, does not consider to be incompatible with the abovementioned Treaty provisions. If users feel aggrieved by the decisions of the Austrian enforcement authorities, they should lodge an appeal against these decisions to the competent authority in Austria. The Commission is currently carrying out a study on vignettes for the use of infrastructure by private cars in order to have an overview concerning the vignette systems as applied in various Member States. In the light of this study, the Commission will review whether there is a need for secondary legislation concerning the imposition of tolls on passenger cars.
