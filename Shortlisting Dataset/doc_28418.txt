ORAL QUESTION H-0197/06 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Leopold Rutowicz to the Commission Subject: Implementation of anti-corruption legislation in Romania Last year, the Commission stated that Romania met the political criteria for EU membership. However, the Romanian Senate's rejection of anti-corruption legislation on 9 February in addition to claims in the international media that the Romanian Government supports certain interest groups that benefit financially from this arrangement prompt the question of whether Romania is ready for this final, decisive step in the accession process. The Commission is currently drafting a monitoring report on the country's progress in fulfilling membership requirements. The fight against corruption should be one of the main priorities, as it is a threat to the correct application of the European Union's policies. What specific measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that Romania steps up its efforts to implement anti-corruption legislation effectively?
