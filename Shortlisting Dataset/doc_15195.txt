The financial framework for the implementation of the Community actions under this Decision for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2008 is hereby set at EUR 149 million , of which EUR 55,6 million is for the period until 31 December 2006.

In order to find a compromise with the Council the Parliament can accept a minor reduction.
