2002/C 205 E/059 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3713/01 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (17 January 2002) Subject: Former Commission employees' consultancies The former Commissioner Martin Bangemann went into the private sector and became a highly paid consultant and board member of Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms business. Mr Bangemann's network of contacts and the knowledge he gained as a Member of the Commission were considered very valuable and naturally gave Telefonica an advantage. A debate started up on the posts it was appropriate for former members of the Commission to hold. However, former directors-general and their deputies also go on at least as often to become highly paid consultants in industry straight after leaving the Commission, and there are also straight exchanges between the Commission and industry. A former Commission employee is, of course, not the property of the Commission. But there must be some requirements ensuring that confidential information such people obtain when working for the Commission is not used in such a way as to distort competition in the internal market after they have left the Commission. Has the Commission come up with an ethical rule governing the jobs former directors-general and their deputies may hold after leaving the Commission?
