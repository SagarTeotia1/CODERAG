Answer given by Mrs Grybauskaitė on behalf of the Commission (18 June 2009) 1 and 2. The Commission's central accounting system ABAC allows searches by contracts awarded since 1 January 2005. Contracts awarded are encoded under different categories and the codifications used do not match exactly the category of contracts that the Honourable Member requests. The closest category corresponds to ‘Other (non informatics) consultants’. Tables with the relevant information by company, contract and amount for 2005‑09 are sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. The Commission could undertake further research, should the Honourable Member identify specific questions on particular contracts or projects or fields of legislation. 3 and 6. The Commission's financial database including the contract repository (ABAC) does not contain aggregated data concerning types of the procedures, launching dates and the media in which information related to the call for tender is published The information on the different types of procurement procedures and their publicity can be found in the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, Articles 90 & 91. . However, this type of information can be provided in relation to individual contracts. 4 and 5. See lists attached The annex is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. .
