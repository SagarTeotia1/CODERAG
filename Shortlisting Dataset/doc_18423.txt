Question for written answer E-009862/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Debora Serracchiani (S&D) (31 October 2011) Subject: Abuse of a dominant position by the company Alilauro In April 2011 the Neapolitan coastal shipping association (ACAP) increased fares for journeys in the Gulf of Naples and the Gulf of Salerno. The price increase applies to routes connecting the islands of Ischia, Procida and Capri with the mainland, and constitutes a breach of Article 101(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits the direct or indirect fixing of purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions. The company Alilauro, which operates in the Gulf of Naples and in particular serves the Napoli‑Ischia route, announced a fare increase of 32 %. In the PDF version of the timetable for the month of October, available on the Alilauro website, most of the crossings are marked ‘ residuale ’ (at operator’s discretion), and these are the services used by Ischia residents. Furthermore, Caremar, a public company and Alilauro’s principal competitor, has announced that, as of 1 October 2011, some of its hydrofoil and ferry crossings are being discontinued and a new timetable is being brought in. The fare increase announced by Alilauro could constitute an abuse of a dominant position, as defined by Article 102 of the TFEU, given that at many times of the day Alilauro is the only company offering crossings between Ischia and the mainland. In light of the above, does the Commission intend to take steps to prevent Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU from being breached?
