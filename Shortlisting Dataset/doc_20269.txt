that transparency and non-discrimination may not have been guaranteed while procedures were taking place; 34. Notes the Court's criticism that, in relation to recruitment procedures, the selection criteria were neither decided by selection boards at the outset nor defined in conformity with the vacancy notice, and the Foundation's reply that all vacancy notices now include a clear indication of whether success in tests is a precondition for success in the competition; 35. Notes that the Foundation's balance sheet includes land and buildings valued at EUR 1,8 million (although the 1992 construction cost was EUR 7,2 million) and an accumulated surplus of EUR 4,09 million; 36. Notes from the Foundation's Annual Report for 2006 that in 2006 the Foundation set up a project management system to improve organisational efficiency through greater transparency and better coordination in the use of resources, and that a performance monitoring system was also implemented to further increase efficiency; in addition, the procurement system was expanded to provide greater flexibility; 37. Notes further that, in 2006, the Foundation launched an ex-post evaluation of the 2001-2004 work programme, in conjunction with an interim evaluation of selected aspects of the Foundation's ongoing work, with a view to determining the organisation's impact, added value and effectiveness; asks to be informed of the results of the evaluation. 28.2.2008 OPINION of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2006 ( C6-0372/2007 – 2007/2047(DEC) ) Draftswoman: Jamila Madeira SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Budgetary Control, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Notes the implementation of the 2006 budget; 2. Draws attention to the fact that, although the Court of Auditors confirms that in the financial year ended 31 December 2006 the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions complied in all essential respects with the provisions relating to reliability, there were a number of failings, not least as regards the budget annuality rule, the award of two contracts, the fact that amounts to be disbursed in full in 2007 were budgeted for in 2006, and the failure to observe the selection criteria applying to officials, thus raising the suspicion that transparency and non-discrimination may not have been guaranteed while the procedure was taking place; 3. Recognises the dominant role of the Foundation in disseminating independent comparative studies with a view to enhancing the quality of life and work in the European Union, and in advising public and private bodies; congratulates the Foundation both on the recent establishment of the European Monitoring Centre on Change, the purpose of which is to analyse and anticipate changes in employment and the business world, the aim being to bolster socio-economic progress, and in connection with the assessment of applications under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and considers that this latter area requires a more substantial budget;
