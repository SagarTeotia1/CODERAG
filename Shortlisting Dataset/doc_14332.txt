Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (19 May 2006) The take-up rate (36 %) mentioned in the reply to the Honourable Member’s Written Question E‑3661/05 includes payments made under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) up to 24 October 2005. The take-up rate (40.16 %) referred to in the reply to the Honourable Member’s Written Question E‑4930/05 includes payments made under all of the Structural Funds (ERDF, European Social Fund — ESF, European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund — EAGGF and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance — FIFG) up to 30 November 2005. On the issue of the retroactive inclusion of projects, the Commission stated clearly in its answer to Written Question E‑4930/05 , and also subsequently in its answer to the Honourable Member’s Written Question E‑515/06 , that insofar as such projects comply with the eligibility, selection and other criteria of the operational programme and of the Community support framework concerned, the regulations would seem to allow this practice in principle. Provided all the above conditions are complied with, the question of whether the Greek Government includes completed projects in the operational programmes is a matter for the Greek Government. Provided all the above conditions are complied with, there would be no negative consequences to the inclusion of completed projects in operational programmes of the Community support framework.
