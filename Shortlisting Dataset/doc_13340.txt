additional space, due to accession, under the EIB lendings guarantee mandate amounts to € 2 180 million and whereas a separate proposal concerning its potential use has been put forward in parallel to the current proposal. Justification It should not be disregarded that the non-coverage of loans to accession countries by the guarantee mechansim could be taken up by other countries/regions and that the Commission has proposed this under a separate proposal ( COM(2003) 603 ). Amendment 4 RECITAL 5C (new) (5c) whereas the amount provisioned to the Guarantee Fund, corresponding to the loans no longer covered by it, amount to approximately € 343 million and will flow back to the budget as revenue. Justification The Commission has calculated that this is the sum to be paid back from the Garantee Fund. Amendment 5 ARTICLE 1, PARAGRAPH 3 Article 7 (Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94) (3) In Article 7, the date “31 March” shall be replaced by “30 June”. (3) In Article 7, the date “31 March” shall be replaced by “31 May” . Justification The Commission will still have two extra months to prepare the report and this date would be better considering the Parliament calendar. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Background As members will recall, the guarantee fund mechanism was originally established along with the financial perspective for the period 1993-1999 as a way of protecting the EU budget from potential risk in relation with its growing external loans. In October 1994, Council Regulation 2728/94 was adopted establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions. The technical parameters (but not the basic functioning) of the system was revised Amending regulation 1149/99 of 25 May 1999 (OJ L139, 2 June 1999) along with the establishment of the new financial perspective. The technical details of this system can seem daunting for most observers who are not directly involved and will not be repeated here as they have been covered in detail by previous working documents from the rapporteur Working Document on the Guarantee Feserve and Guarantee Fund: current situation and evolution 2000-2006 (PE 232.992) , Working Document on EC/Euroatom lending and guarantee capacity for external actions (PE 311.110) . However, it might be useful to recapitulate the basic functioning of the system: The guarantee fund mechanism covers three different types of lending in third countries: guarantees for EIB lending, for EU macro-financial assistance loans (MFA) and for Euroatom external lending. The guarantee fund mechanism consists of a reserve that is entered annually in the budget, (the amount of which is laid down in the Financial Perspective) and a guarantee fund managed by the EIB on behalf of the Community. The amount in the reserve for 2004 is € 221 million (200 million in 1999 prices) From this reserve, payments are made into the Fund (following a transfer request) in proportion to the level of guarantee to be given for each loan operation. The amount (which can be seen as a type of "insurance charge") corresponds to 9% of the total capital value to be guaranteed. In the case of default by a beneficiary on a loan
