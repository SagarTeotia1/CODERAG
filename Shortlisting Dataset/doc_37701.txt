WRITTEN QUESTION E-1062/09 by Ashley Mote (NI) to the Commission (19 February 2009) Subject: Cost of compliance Does the Commission think that the cost to the British economy of implementing new EU regulations and directives over the last 10 years has been value for money? The think-tank Open Europe has estimated the cost at GBP 107 billion sterling, far more than the UK's gross contribution to the EU budget over the same period. How do these figures compare with the cost of compliance in, say, France, which chooses to be far more selective about applying EU regulations and directives?
