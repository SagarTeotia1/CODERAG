on the necessity of a strategic environmental impact assessment on the TEN-T initiative, including its impact on CO2 emissions; 6. Is convinced that the European Parliament should express its detailed views on this new TEN-T initiative by complete application of the codecision procedure, starting with the first reading of this new TEN-T revision; 7. Points out that there is little scope for redirecting expenditure in Heading 3 of the Financial Perspective (internal policies) without touching upon financial envelopes agreed by the Council and Parliament in codecision or reducing Parliament's margin of manoeuvre; is prepared to consider a revision of the Financial Perspectives so as to establish a new loan guarantee instrument to help finance projects that enhance environmentally sustainable growth and for which extended impact assessments have successfully been completed; Employment 8. Takes note of the report on 'Creating more employment in Europe' presented by the Task Force; supports its view that the European Union is at a critical point of development with unacceptably high unemployment; welcomes the Council's commitment to reaching the Lisbon target of a 70% employment rate by 2010; calls on the Council to propose a follow-up to the report as well as an Action Plan to achieve the Lisbon employment targets; 9. Welcomes the joint message of the European Social Partners to the Tripartite Social Summit on 11 December; points out that social dialogue is a key element of the modernisation of the labour market; calls for better conditions to be created for information, consultation and participation of the workforce and, in particular, for immediate action to be taken to revise the European Works Council Directive; 10.

Expresses its deep concern at the general approach taken by the Council on the two Commission proposals for Council Regulations on biometric identifiers in visas and residence permits, at the Commission's future proposal for the introduction of biometric identifiers in passports and at the Council's commitment to take decisions on the development of the Visa Information System (VIS) as soon as possible; 13.
