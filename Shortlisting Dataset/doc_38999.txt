Question for oral answer O-000161/2011 to the Commission Rule 115 Marie-Christine Vergiat , Nikolaos Chountis on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group Subject: EU support for the democratic transition process in Tunisia Since 14 January 2011, the European Union has repeatedly declared its readiness to support the democratic process in Tunisia. In particular, the EU has provided substantial humanitarian aid to fund reception arrangements for the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have arrived in Tunisia since the start of the uprising and conflict in Libya. It has also helped to set up refugee camps and repatriate people to their countries of origin. On 15 June 2011, the European External Action Service reported to Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights that there were 6 000 people in the camps and that pledges had been made to resettle 780 refugees. Which Member States have made a commitment to take in refugees and what stage has been reached in discussions with the Council and Member States on providing greater support for refugees fleeing the Libyan conflict, in which several Member States are involved? The European Union has also announced that, in addition to humanitarian aid, other resources will be made available to deal with the economic and social crisis triggered in particular by the drop in tourism revenue and the shrinking of trade with Libya. The EEAS confirmed to the Subcommittee on Human Rights that, whilst it was now clear which financial instruments would be used, the funds had not yet been released. What are the reasons for the delay? Economic aid needs to be released unconditionally as a matter of urgency, given that economic and social circumstances could threaten the fragile democratic transition process. When will the funds be released?
