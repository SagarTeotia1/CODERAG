Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (27 April 2011) The Commission does not plan to adopt a strategic plan to enable health authorities to propose suitable dietary formulas based on personal needs and preferences in terms of semi-solid or semi-liquid regimes in hospitals. In line with the subsidiarity principle and according to Article 168(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, such initiatives remain in the remit of the Member States, who are responsible for the organisation of their health systems and delivery of healthcare.
