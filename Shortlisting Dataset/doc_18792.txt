WRITTEN QUESTION E-6373/07 by Christine De Veyrac (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (18 December 2007) Subject: Auditing The Court of Auditors annual report on the financial year 2006 has just been published. Despite the Commission’s efforts to rationalise its administration of the accounts, the Court emphasised the persistence of errors affecting the legality and regularity of the ‘majority of Community expenditure’, and the weakness of the ‘internal controls’ on the budget. Can the Commission indicate what measures it has since taken to put the accounts on a sounder footing? Could it also specify what future initiatives it will take to improve the management of the European budget?
