Question for written answer E-001569/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (9 February 2012) Subject: The new Spanish government's water policy In his first appearance before the lower house of parliament, the new Spanish government’s Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Environment announced his intention to implement a review of the National Hydrological Plan. The minister was clearly in favour of new transfers between river basins, citing, without any technical substantiation, the existence of surplus basins. These statements represent a clear threat to reopen the Ebro water transfer project, albeit covertly. Some of Spain’s regions, including Catalonia, have already approved internal basin management plans, in compliance with the Water Framework Directive. The management plan for the Ebro river basin, which has yet to be approved, still has to determine its ecological flows. In 2004, the Commission’s Directorate-General for the Environment and Directorate-General for the Economy opposed the Ebro water transfer. Moreover, the project was met with an unprecedented level of public resistance in the areas concerned, and was also opposed by the governments of the regions liable to be affected by the environmental impact of the infrastructure. What is the Commission’s opinion of the new Spanish Government line on water policy? In view of the factors of additional financial costs, high environmental impact, public and institutional opposition and lack of consensus at regional level, does the Commission consider the Ebro water transfer project to be advisable? Given that the regions have already begun to implement the Water Framework Directive, does the Commission consider that this transfer would be consistent with the principles of that directive?
