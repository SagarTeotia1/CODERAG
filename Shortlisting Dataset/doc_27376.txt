Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (2 October 2007) Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air, OJ L 204, 26.7.2006 . establishes rules for the protection of and provision of assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility travelling by air, both to protect them against discrimination and to ensure that they receive assistance. The non‑discrimination requirement contained in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 is made clear in Articles 3 and 10. Article 3 defines the scope of the ban on refusal of carriage of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. It stipulates that an air carrier or its agent or a tour operator may not, on the grounds of disability or of reduced mobility, refuse to accept a reservation for a flight departing from or arriving at an airport to which the Regulation applies, or to embark a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility at such an airport, provided that the person concerned has a valid ticket and reservation. Article 10, which deals with the requirement for air carriers to provide assistance, stipulates that an air carrier must provide assistance on board without additional charge to a disabled person or person with reduced mobility, provided that the person in question fulfils the conditions set out in Article 7(1), (2) and (4) of the Regulation. None of the Articles of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 containing any requirement for disabled passengers or passengers with reduced mobility to contact airlines on a premium‑cost telephone line. Nevertheless, if it were shown that only disabled passengers were being required to contact airlines on a premium‑cost telephone line, this could – depending on the circumstances – constitute a hidden additional charge contrary to Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006. Any possible infringement of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 must be brought to the notice of the national enforcement body designated by each Member State pursuant to Article 14 of the Regulation. It should be noted that Directive 2000/78/EC Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000 . establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation is not relevant in this case. Although the Directive combats discrimination based inter alia on disability, its substantive scope does not cover transport services. The Commission, in its capacity as guardian of the EC Treaty, will if necessary raise the matter with the Member State concerned in order to establish whether such a practice exists and how it operates and to determine whether it is unlawful. To that end, the Commission would ask the Honourable Member to supply any information which he may have on the matter.
