WRITTEN QUESTION E-1593/05 by Rebecca Harms (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (28 April 2005) Subject: ERDF funding for a construction project in Cuxhaven/Duhnen In the district of Duhnen in Cuxhaven a construction project is currently being carried out next to the ‘ahoi’ leisure and wave pool complex. According to a citizen concerned about the project, it is receiving European Union ERDF funding. This is denied by the head of the City of Cuxhaven's Economic Development Department. The project will apparently involve the building of five villas by the beach with a total of 99 owner‑occupied apartments. Public facilities or general tourist facilities are not planned. Furthermore, the plot of land which has been given the all‑clear for construction is evidently a green space rather like a park, which, before building began, was freely accessible to the public and used for rest and recreational purposes, and which had the only children's play area in Duhnen. 1. Is the construction project receiving ERDF or other EU funding, or does it form part of another project receiving EU funding? 2. If so, what is the level of EU funding and what are the reasons given for granting such funding for a construction project solely involving the building of owner‑occupied apartments, and on what grounds is the construction project claimed to be of public benefit? 3. What steps are taken by the Commission in the event that funding for a project is applied for and approved on a false basis?
