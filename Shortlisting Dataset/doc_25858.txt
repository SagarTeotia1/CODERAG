the exchange of good practices; 9. Calls on regional and local authorities to make better use of the SF to build up research, knowledge and innovation capacity in their regions, for instance by setting up research infrastructure, enabling them to take part in EU research and innovation activities; encourages regions to establish R&D priorities that are complementary with those of FP7; 10. Calls on the Commission to simplify the bureaucracy for the FP7 and CIP in order to strengthen the effects of synergies with the Structural Funds and to ensure regional-level analysis of research and innovation potential and needs as well as analysis of the inter-relations with other instruments in the evaluation studies on either of the three financing instruments in order to be able to provide joint guidance; 11. Supports stronger collaboration between national FP7 contact points, managers of R&D programmes and innovation agencies, allowing different aspects or phases of research and innovation projects to be funded from different sources; recommends closer cooperation between the Enterprise Europe Network and the Structural Funds’ managing authorities and a closer link between the Lead-Market Initiative, Technology Platforms and regional technological roadmaps; 12. Calls on Member States and the Commission to earmark more funding from the SF for research and innovation - in particular sustainable innovations -, strengthen research capacities, and support particularly knowledge-intensive regional innovative clusters and the new Knowledge and Innovation Communities; calls for the sustainable development of regional research and strategic frameworks for innovation in collaboration with the private sector, universities and research institutes; 13. Points out that research and innovation, in particular as regards the development of low or zero carbon emissions and energy savings, are of critical importance for addressing global challenges, such as climate change and security of energy supplies, and also for improving competitiveness at regional and local level; 14. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the upcoming Research and Innovation Plan will be drafted with a view to strengthening the synergies between the Structural Funds and the Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation (FP7, CIP); 15. Believes that the fact that mixed financing is not allowed between Structural Funds and Framework Programmes prevents regions from using both instruments at the same time and that effective ‘bottom-up’ strategic processes at both regional and national level could help eliminate gaps or overlaps of funding from SF, FP7 and CIP; furthermore, calls for long-term planning at regional level in order to achieve synergies that derive from thematic complementarities between the financing instruments.
