girls. They represent nearly half of the infected population. This proportion reaches 57 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. "We are witnessing the feminisation of the pandemic," said European Parliament President Josep BORRELL at the opening of the session. MEPs say that if the present trend of ever increasing numbers of infections continues, "there will be no chance of achieving the overarching Millennium Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 and reducing by half the proportion of people living on less that a dollar a day and suffering from hunger." They call for the Member States, the Commission and the United Nations to reinforce their strategies on prevention, education, care and treatment. They regret the lack of sufficient funding for research, in particular regarding efforts to develop an AIDS vaccine. For this reason, they are calling for increase resources to be made available in the 2007-2013 EU Financial Perspective, significantly to strengthen the fights against HIV/AIDS. MEPs call for the EU to contribute at least €1bn on a sustained basis to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. They also stress the need to take into account the particular situations of vulnerable groups and to ensure developing countries have access to medicines, including generic drugs: antiretroviral treatments against AIDS as well as medicines for the treatment of diseases which often go hand in hand with AIDS, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C and mental illness. Parliament urges the Commission to oppose efforts by the USA to make bilateral agreements with developing countries in which the latter renounce the right to use or import generic drugs necessary for the public health of their population.
