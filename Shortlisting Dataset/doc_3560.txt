a Commission statement. HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis continue to cause the deaths of some six million people each year, wipe out years of development efforts and achievements and constitute a serious long term concern due to their destabilising effects on society. The European Union and its neighbouring countries now face the threat of a ‘ new epidemic’ . Parts of Europe have the fastest rate of new HIV/AIDS cases in the world. Latest figures released recently by UNAIDS confirmed that the numbers of new infections are increasing throughout the 25 EU Member States and in its east European neighbours. The transmission pattern is also changing. While sexually transmitted infections remain predominant in some parts of the European Continent many of the rapid rises in infections are due to intravenous drug users. HIV infection continues to have a major public health impact. In Western and Central Europe more than 26 000 people were infected with HIV in 2005. In this region heterosexual intercourse has become the main mode of transmission, and harm reduction programmes have helped to reduce the spread of HIV among injecting drug users. The main challenge is to sustain this positive development and to prevent HIV transmission from infected injecting drug users to their sexual partners. In order to save lives it is important to make sure that people do not to use drugs but it is equally important to work with injecting drug users and implement comprehensive harm reduction services as an essential component of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS programme.

In developing countries in particular, medicinal products are in circulation which are too strong or too weak, have no active ingredient or are even toxic. In those countries the medicinal products which are most often counterfeited are those used to treat potentially fatal diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. World trends in the counterfeiting of medicinal products are worrying. According to WHO estimates, 6% of drugs on the world market are counterfeit - the US Food and Drug Administration put the figure at 10%. Up to 70% of the anti-malaria drugs available in Cameroon are counterfeit. In 2003 the WHO corroborated this figure for six other African countries. Of the medicinal products consumed in poor countries, 25% are allegedly counterfeit. The EU is a late entrant to the international fight against counterfeiting. -
