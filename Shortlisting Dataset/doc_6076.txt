WRITTEN QUESTION E-1977/07 by Ashley Mote (ITS) to the Commission (13 April 2007) Subject: The eurozone problem is getting out of hand — Mark 2 Given Mr Almunia's unconvincing answer to my Question E‑0636/07, and his claimed ‘benefits’ for the eurozone, can the Commission and the ECB now explain why Italians find prices have inflated by some 30 % since the launch of the euro, the Irish have a similar problem, and neither sovereign nation can devalue its currency and raise interest rates to control the situations in which they find themselves?
