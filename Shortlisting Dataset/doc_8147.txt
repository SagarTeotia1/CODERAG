Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (22 February 2012) The European Commission has been always supporting pluralism in media and fought any symptoms of discrimination based on beliefs. According to the EU telecom rules, in view of the relevant value of radio frequencies Member States shall ensure the effective management of radio frequencies and shall grant rights to use frequencies on the basis of objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria and objective, transparent, non-discriminatory, proportionate and open procedures. The national procedures can foresee specific assessment criteria, including the ones concerning the financial standing of the contestants, provided that the abovementioned principles are respected. In this regard, given the costs related to the presence at a multiplex, the Commission note that the financial reliability of each and every broadcaster sharing the multiplex might be crucial for the functioning of the whole enterprise and therefore it can be considered a legitimate assessment criterion. On the other hand, the assessment concerning the correct application of this criterion by the Polish authorities in the specific case at stake primarily belongs to the national courts to which the parties have a right to refer the question, in line with EU Telecom rules.
