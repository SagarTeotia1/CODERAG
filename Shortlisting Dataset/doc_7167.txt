Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (16 May 2011) More generally, it is up to the authorities of the relevant Member States and third countries to decide on the recovery of allegedly stolen assets and ask for the judicial cooperation of the international community. The EU stands ready to support them in such processes. Regarding the case of Mr Gbagbo, the EU has had sanctions — including an asset freeze and travel bans — on the former President of the Ivory Coast and his entourage as of 13 December 2010. The list of individuals targeted by these sanctions has been expanded several times, most recently on 6 April 2011. The Swiss government aligned their position with that of the EU, as of 19 January 2011 and the United Nations Security Council adopted similar sanctions on 30 March 2011. The EU is aware of media reports claiming although without citing any concrete sources, that the Gbabgo fortune has been transferred from Swiss bank accounts to third countries.
