WRITTEN QUESTION E-2194/09 by Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (31 March 2009) Subject: Neofascism in Italy The cult of fascism, or neofascism, is dangerously on the rise throughout the Italian peninsula and is uniting students, football supporters and politicians. Five official political parties declare themselves to be neofascist ( Forza Nuova, Fiamma Tricolore, la Destra, Azione Sociale and Fronte Sociale Nazionale ); there is an even greater number of clubs and associations – all this as if it were perfectly legitimate and not in breach of our Constitution. Between 2005 and 2008 there were 330 attacks by neofascist militants, which were regrettably ignored by the government. Indeed, it is not unusual to see mayors and ministers alongside the founders of the above-mentioned fascist associations. But the search for political consensus goes even further: in the Veneto region we are seeing institutional posts, jobs and seats going to openly neofascist leaders who have already been arrested for attacks and incitement of racial hatred. 1. Is the Commission aware of the worrying phenomenon of neofascism in Italy? 2. Does the Commission not think that the Italian Government should isolate and suppress this phenomenon, instead of tolerating close relationships between members of the majority and well-known, openly neofacist and neo-Nazi figures?
