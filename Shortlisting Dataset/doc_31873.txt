WRITTEN QUESTION E-4190/07 by Glyn Ford (PSE) to the Commission (21 August 2007) Subject: Discrimination and the Cordoba Agreement of September 2006 In the context of the Cordoba Understandings announced on 18 September 1996 the UK acknowledged that a historic wrong had been committed in 1988 in freezing Gibraltar social security pensions for all pensioners and this was being put right. All such pensions were revalued on 1 April 2007 by 65.2 %. However, exclusively Spanish pensioners who had contributed prior to 1969 to the Gibraltar Social Insurance Fund (‘GSIF’) were offered an additional payment amounting to the approximate loss of income suffered as a result of the 19-year pensions freeze. This treatment in respect of loss of past increases discriminates between pensioners with equal contribution records on grounds of nationality and date of contribution. The Commission has received complaints from affected Gibraltar pensioners excluded from the back payment, and was asked to examine the payments for a possible breach of EC law, in March this year. Has the Commission now undertaken this work and come to a conclusion?
