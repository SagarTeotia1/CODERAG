In a first-reading report tabled by Jules MAATEN (ELDR, NL) on Commission proposals for a new bathing water directive, the committee demands stricter rules concerning the scope of the directive, the definition of bathing water and - the key issue - public information about the quality of bathing water areas throughout the Community. In its draft text, the Commission proposes that Member States be required, in the immediate vicinity of any bathing water, to provide a non-technical summary of the bathing water profile and the bathing water classification over the last three years. According to the Environment Committee a more user-friendly approach is needed. Therefore, the rapporteur is tabling an amendment calling for symbols to be used to inform the public about the current quality of bathing water at any particular site. MEPs want the Commission, after consulting the Member States, tourist and consumer organisations, to devise within two years a new simple standard system of symbols (e.g. smiling faces or smileys) to be used by public authorities and tourist offices as a means to indicate water quality. The Environment Committee also demands that, in the event of an emergency, public authorities work with all interested parties to ensure that the public is clearly informed of any potential hazards through temporary signs at the bathing site. The Commission's draft says that Member States should use appropriate media and technologies, such as the internet, to disseminate information. MEPs say this should include at least an English and French translation. In addition, they want results of water inspections to be available on the internet within a week.
