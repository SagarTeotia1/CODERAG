adopted a Fundamental Rights Strategy in March 2011, followed by the adoption of an Action Plan on 30 September 2011.The responsibilities of Frontex are to be distinguished from those of the Member State at whose external borders control and surveillance activities take place. Under Article 8(2)(b) of the regulation, Frontex can deploy its experts to support a Member State requiring assistance. The Agency may also, pursuant to Article 3(1) of the regulation, be involved in joint operations which involve cooperation with several Member States. The Agency may also, at the request of a Member State faced with a situation of urgent and exceptional pressure, deploy one or more Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABIT) on the territory of the requesting Member State (Article 8a of the regulation). In none of these three cases does Frontex exercise operational command. Operational command is in all cases exercised by the Member State(s) at whose external border the control and surveillance activities take place. This is in line with the fourth recital of the regulation, which is not being amended. With regard to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, Frontex's mandate in a RABIT operation is limited to coordinating assistance to a Member State in reinforcing the latter's controls of the external border. All guest officers are under the operational command of the host Member State, in this instance Greece. The HRW report acknowledges that Frontex has itself repeatedly called on the Greek Government to take action to improve detention conditions, and made suggestions to this effect.
