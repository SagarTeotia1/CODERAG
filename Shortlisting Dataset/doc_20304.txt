WRITTEN QUESTION E-2106/04 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Council (20 September 2004) Subject: Economic and political pressure on South Africa in connection with the policy of sanctions against Zimbabwe In February 2004, the Council adopted a Common Strategy towards Zimbabwe. It also extended and expanded the existing sanctions against President Mugabe and his associates (Regulation No 314/2004 OJ L 55, 24.2.2004, p. 1 . ). However, as the European Parliament has already observed, the EU's policy is not being very effective, and is also lacking in coherence (e.g. Resolution of 13 May 2003, EU Bulletin 5-2003, 1.6.108). It is high time to adopt a completely different policy. African countries must take sides on this issue. In 2003, for example, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria wrote to Australia's Prime Minister John Howard that the notorious land reform programme was functioning ‘normally’ and that in general the situation had improved (BBC News, 13 February 2003). However, during the same period major opposition leaders were arrested and food aid was even politicised. Only members of the ZANU party received food aid (BBC News, 10 February 2003). The European Parliament rightly states that economic, financial or technical aid to the ACP countries can continue only if these countries make an effort in the field of democracy, the rule of law and good governance, inter alia by participating in a joint campaign against, inter alia, the Mugabe regime (Paragraph 40 of Resolution P5_TA(2004)0376, 22 April 2004). Zimbabwe's neighbours, in particular, with the heavyweight South Africa leading the way, have protected Mugabe for far too long. Many experts say that South Africa is degenerating into a one-party state and draw parallels with Zimbabwe (De Tijd, 14 April 2004). On 27 April 2004, when Thabo Mbeki was sworn in for his second term as President of South Africa, Mugabe was prominent among the guests. What is the Council's view of the European Parliament's position? Is not South Africa, among other countries, seriously deficient in the field of human rights policy? Does not compliance with the human rights clause in the ACP Agreement require active participation by South Africa, among others, in a different sanctions policy against Mugabe?
