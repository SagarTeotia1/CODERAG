WRITTEN QUESTION E-5031/09 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (15 October 2009) Subject: The Tobin tax and G20 In a recent interview given to El País (6.10.2009) during the IMF meeting in Istanbul, the Fund’s First Deputy Managing Director, John Lipsky, was asked whether the debate on introducing a Tobin tax on speculation would spark a new tug-of-war between Europe and the USA, in addition to the disagreement on limiting bonuses. It should be noted that this tax was suggested by, amongst others, the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who believes that it could be a useful tool in reducing speculation and helping poor countries. In reply, Mr Lipsky stated the following: ‘There is agreement on the general idea that some form of limit will be placed on bankers’ remuneration, although there may be discrepancies in the details. As for a new tax, the G20 has asked the Fund draw up a study on this. There are various ideas as to how to make banks pay compensation for the results of their actions. What I told the G20 appears sensible to me: we should introduce some kind of tax on the sector, such as a form of mandatory insurance, which could make sense for systemic entities. But we still do not have a final answer.’ When asked again when he could give an answer he replied that he intended to do so at the G20 summit in Canada in June 2010. Could the Commission therefore tell us what position it is likely to take on the introduction of such a Tobin-style tax at this next G20 in Canada and what related proposals it is working on in preparation for this summit?
