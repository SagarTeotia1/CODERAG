WRITTEN QUESTION E-3737/07 by Carlos Carnero González (PSE) to the Commission (20 July 2007) Subject: The Torrelodones Área Homogénea Norte Development On 1 March this year, an EU Petitions Committee delegation visited Torrelodones in the Madrid Autonomous Community, to corroborate in situ the complaints submitted by the inhabitants against the local council's intention to develop the Área Homogénea Norte, located within an area which the EU has declared to be an SCI. The Committee on Petitions then proceeded to adopt a report which pointed out that although the scheme was currently at a standstill, there were no guarantees at all that it would not be reactivated following the 27 May local elections. Regrettably, precisely this happened at the first plenary sitting of the Council after the election. In 2006, I raised this issue in Question E‑3826/06 to the Commission, and I believe there is an urgent need for the Commission to act in a decisive fashion as a matter of urgency, in order to ensure that the obligations laid down in Article 6 (3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive are met. Is the Commission going to gather all requisite information on this issue from the Torrelodones town council and from the governments of the Madrid Autonomous Community and the Kingdom of Spain? Does the Commission realise that an excessive delay in taking preventive decisions could mean the destruction of a protected woodland area of quite extraordinary ecological value?
