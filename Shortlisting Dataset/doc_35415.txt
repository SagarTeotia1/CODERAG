Question for written answer E-007285/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (22 July 2011) Subject: Underground storage of carbon dioxide In Shanxi province in China, a project is about to be launched to store 2 000 tons of CO 2 underground and extract methane in order to reuse it as an energy source. This project will use a technique called ‘enhanced coal bed methane recovery (ECBMR)’, a method of producing methane gas by extracting it from coal strata present in the ground in some geological areas. The CO 2 is injected into bituminous strata (occupying pore space in the bed) and is adsorbed onto the carbon in the coal at approximately twice the rate of methane, making it possible to recover gas. As the drilling will be performed horizontally rather than vertically, as would normally be the case, it will be possible to penetrate more effectively inside the bed, increasing the efficiency of the process and maximising the amount of methane recovered and the quantity of CO 2 stored. This technique can also be used at power stations operating with fossil fuels, sequestering the CO 2 emitted during the production process in order to avoid emitting it into the environment. In view of the advantages of using this new technique to store a greenhouse gas, will the Commission promote similar projects within the territory of the European Union in order to help reduce the environmental damage caused by atmospheric pollution?
