Reply (16 April 2008) Following the introduction of a ban by the EC on all Indonesian civil aviation carriers, the EC has taken every opportunity to stress to Indonesia that ban was adopted exclusively on technical grounds, due to the importance of the passenger's safety and taking into consideration International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards. Since then the EC and its Member States have been assisting the Indonesian authorities to meet this aviation safety challenge by putting in place technical improvements where most needed to improve the safety system, and they intend to strengthen their partnership with Indonesia. It is for the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authorities and the air carriers to develop and implement a concrete remedial action plan. The Commission and the Member States are providing technical assistance toward this goal. The Commission has organised a Conference on Indonesia-EU Partnership for Aviation Safety in Indonesia (Bandung, 21 to 25 January 2008) with a view to strengthening its cooperation with the Indonesian authorities and in particular aiming at helping the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority to improve its safety standards and practices to comply with international rules. The Commission is also providing a European aviation expert to assist and advise the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority in implementing its corrective action plan and identifying areas of possible further assistance. With these concrete actions the EC is actively pursuing actively its commitment to a constructive dialogue with Indonesia on air safety, which supports Indonesia's efforts to improve air safety in accordance with its international obligations.
