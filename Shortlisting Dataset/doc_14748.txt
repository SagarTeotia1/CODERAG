Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (7 October 2009) The Commission already reviews periodically the scientific basis and adequacy of the EMF limits as laid down in Recommendation 1999/519/EC Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300 GHz), OJ L 199/59, 30.7.1999. and reports to Parliament. Earlier this year, the Commission asked the Scientific Committee of Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to produce an opinion on the Research needs and methodology to address the remaining knowledge gaps on the potential health effects of EMF http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_024.pdf . This opinion was adopted on 6 July 2009 and will serve as basis for eventual decisions concerning the need for additional research on potential long-term adverse effects of electromagnetic fields through the 7th Framework Programme for Research (FP7). Currently, two FP7-funded projects on this issue are to receive a combined EC contribution of EUR 6.5 million: — MOBI-KIDS, a large epidemiological study in seven European and five non-European countries investigating the risk of cancer of the central nervous system in children and adolescents related to mobile phone use, started this year, and — SEAWIND, still under negotiation, which will explore exposure and health risks to wireless communication devices in various settings such as workplaces and schools. With respect to the placement of masts, this is an exclusive competence of national and local authorities. However, the Commission is willing to provide its support to the development and sharing of best practice in this area should there be a demand from all stakeholders. With respect to the Interphone study, Dr Christopher Wild, Director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the coordinating institute of the Interphone project, recently issued a statement saying that a first manuscript from all collaborating centres on gliomas and meningiomas has been submitted for publication to a scientific journal and is now subject to the normal peer-review process. He also said that work is ongoing to prepare subsequent manuscripts for publication and that it is further hoped that the publication process of this first paper should be relatively quick.
