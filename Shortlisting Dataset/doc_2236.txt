Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (10 April 2006) The Commission is aware that shots were fired on 16 February 2006 against the Surp Krikor Lusavoric Church in Kayseri. According to the information available to the Commission, the local authorities took the necessary security measures around the church and placed police officers on duty in the church’s garden. The Turkish authorities must assume responsibility for ensuring that law and order is maintained and freedom of worship is duly respected. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation of religious freedom and freedom to worship in Turkey as part of its regular monitoring of Turkey’s compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria.
