economically efficient and more environmentally effective; 80. Calls on the Commission to explore innovative financial instruments for investment in a low-carbon economy; 81. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to support the creation of innovation clusters in order to develop regional and national solutions; Transport 82. Endorses the requirement of the Commission Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 60 % by 2050 compared to 1990 levels in the EU; furthermore, calls on the Commission to come forward with interim emissions reduction targets for the sector in order to ensure that sufficient action is taken at an early stage; 83. Welcomes the progress made by vehicle manufacturers in reducing CO 2 emissions from passenger cars since 2007, and stresses the importance of accelerating further fuel efficiency improvements; affirms that in preparing its forthcoming review the Commission should be proposing ways of ensuring that average CO 2 emissions by new cars meet the agreed 2020 target of not more than 95g/km by 2020, and do not exceed 70g/km by 2025; calls on the Commission to increase dialogue and cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation so as to ensure inclusion of the shipping sector in CO 2 reduction commitments; 84. Recalls that the Commission was required to evaluate the progress of the IMO on emissions from shipping by 31 December 2011, pursuant to Directive 2009/29/EC; calls on the Commission to include maritime transport in its roadmap and, in the absence of an international agreement to reduce emissions from shipping, to propose legislation so that these emissions are included in the Community reduction commitment with the aim of the proposed act entering into force by 2013; 85. Calls on the Commission to put forward proposals to improve the fuel efficiency of heavy goods vehicles, and, in its 2013 review of legislation on emissions from light commercial vehicles, to take greater account of the need to improve fuel efficiency so as to reduce the cost to business of increased fuel prices; 86. Calls on the Commission to provide purchasers of all types of passenger and freight vehicles with greater clarity regarding their fuel efficiency, and to put forward the long- delayed proposals for reform of the Labelling Directive, which should encompass all forms of sales promotion; 87. Calls on the Commission to take immediate steps to ensure that the test cycles used to evaluate emissions from new cars accurately reflect the realities of the use of such vehicles in normal driving conditions; 88. Acknowledges the efforts being made by some Member States to establish recharging/refuelling infrastructures to promote the use of electric and ultra-low carbon vehicles, and calls on the Commission to bring forward proposals to set minimum requirements in each Member State in order to establish a Europe-wide network; 89. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to consider it a priority, with a view to reducing transport pollutant emissions, to invest in developing a pan‑European intelligent energy network that can harness energy generated at local and regional level, including from renewable sources, and
