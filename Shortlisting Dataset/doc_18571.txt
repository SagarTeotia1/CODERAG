Question for written answer E-000373/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Morten Messerschmidt (EFD) (26 January 2011) Subject: Muslim holy days on new calendars It has been decided to include Muslim holy days, as from 2011, on standard Danish calendars, which are EU‑approved, not on pages for individual days, but on a single page listing the individual countries' holy days. Muslim countries are not listed separately; rather, Muslim holy days are listed en bloc. On the Commission's own calendar for 2011, Christmas was omitted, but both Muslim and Jewish holy days were included. The objection to this is that, if the EU is to be representative of the Member States, it seems peculiar that any reference to Christianity or its significance for European culture should be downplayed or completely removed. Is it a deliberate act when the EU omits to list Christian holy days, but does list Jewish and Muslim ones, and what are the reasons for this in a Europe where the problem of parallel Muslim societies is increasing each year?
