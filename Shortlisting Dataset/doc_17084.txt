Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (18 October 2004) 1. Article 3a(1) of the Television without frontiers Directive (Council Directive 89/552/EEC as amended by Directive 97/36/EC Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, OJ L 298, 17.10.1989 as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997, OJ L 202, 30.7.1997 . ) allows Member States to take national measures to protect events regarded as being of major importance to society, so that a significant part of the public in that Member State is not deprived of the possibility of seeing such (listed) events on free television. Community law does not oblige Member States to take such measures. The Commission is therefore not in the position to act against Member States that did not wish to adopt the measures concerned. There is no agreement between the Commission and the International Federation of the Football Associations (FIFA) and/or the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in respect of television rights. However, the Commission has adopted a binding Decision based on EU competition law with regard to the joint selling of media rights of the UEFA Champions League, exempting UEFA’s marketing model from the cartel prohibition of Article 81 (1) of the EC Treaty subject to conditions Commission Decision 2003/778/EC of 23 July 2003 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement (COMP/C.2-37.398 - Joint selling of the commercial rights of the UEFA Champions League), OJ L 291, 8.11.2003 . .
