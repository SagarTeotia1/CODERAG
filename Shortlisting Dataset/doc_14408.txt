Question for written answer E-5173/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 George Sabin Cutaş (S&D) (7 July 2010) Subject: A coherent framework for SMEs In the Commission's recently published annual report on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is stated that SMEs are currently experiencing their steepest fall in production since 1930. In addition, according to the document ‘A Programme for Europe: Proposals of Civil Society’, drawn up in 2009 by the European Economic and Social Committee, the current economic crisis places SMEs in a vulnerable position, confronting them with financial difficulties which may even prove fatal. Given the Union's commitment to promoting entrepreneurship and creating a SME-friendly business environment, what measures does the Commission have in mind to assist SMEs in the face of the challenges of the economic crisis? Does the Commission intend to propose a coherent framework for SMEs that will endow them with a central role in the EU's policies, considering their position as a key component of Europe's economic system?
