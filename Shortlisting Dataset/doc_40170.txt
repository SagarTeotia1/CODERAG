WRITTEN QUESTION E-0248/10 by Theodoros Skylakakis (PPE) to the Commission (5 February 2010) Subject: Civil Protection and the European Forest Fire Tactical Reserve Natural disasters have been escalating in recent years and will worsen, due to climate change. In events such as forest fires, great devastation already occurs because the capacity of the Member States proves inadequate in relation to the intensity of the phenomena ‘Takes the view that the scale and impact of these phenomena frequently go beyond regional and national levels and capabilities’, paragraph 8 of the motion for a resolution on forest fires in the summer of 2009 (B7‑0039/2009). . In its motion for a resolution on forest fires in the summer of 2009 (B7‑0039/2009), Parliament called for the EU's civil protection capability to be reinforced. Furthermore, under the Lisbon Treaty, civil protection is recognised for the first time as a self-standing policy to be discussed under the ‘ordinary procedure’ The future for European civil protection: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/civil/prote/perspectives_en.htm, Lisbon Treaty: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML . What action does the Commission intend to take to make the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection more efficient, especially in cases of multiple emergencies? Up to now, the pilot project has included only two Canadair CL 215 fire-fighting aircraft which were operational in last summer's fires and which, according to Commissioner Dimas, ensured ‘a quick response that otherwise would not have been possible’ (IP/09/1111). Does the Commission intend to expand the European Forest Fire Tactical Reserve, and if so, when, how and to what extent?
