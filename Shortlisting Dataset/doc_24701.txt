WRITTEN QUESTION P-5441/06 by Edith Mastenbroek (PSE) to the Commission (6 December 2006) Subject: Follow-up action on Opinion 10/2006 on the processing of personal data by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial telecommunication (SWIFT) On 22 November 2006 the Art29 working party adopted its opinion on the processing of personal data by SWIFT. This opinion gives recommendations and six well-defined immediate actions to be taken while stressing that any measure taken in the fight against crime and terrorism must not reduce standards of protection of fundamental rights. 1. How will the Commission proceed to ensure that the actions proposed by the Art29 working party will be implemented immediately by Member States? 2. Is it correct that the Commission has already stated to the press that it cannot take any action to ensure that SWIFT will comply with Directive 95/46/EC OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31 . but that action will have to be taken by the Belgian Government? 3. Has the Belgian Government already informed the Commission what action it will take?
