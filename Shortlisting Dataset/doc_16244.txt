No 2012/2002. However, the Czech Republic was affected by the same flooding disaster which led to the major disaster in Poland and Slovakia. Therefore, the condition set out in Article 2(2) second subparagraph of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, whereby a country affected by the same major disaster as a neighbouring country may exceptionally benefit from Solidarity Fund aid, was found to be met. Croatia applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund following intense rain with hail and thunderstorms in May and June 2010 causing severe floods that struck eastern and central parts of the country. The disaster caused significant damages to the agriculture sector, public and private property and the transport infrastructure. The Croatian authorities estimated the total direct damage caused by the disaster at EUR 153 039 303. As this amount is below the threshold of EUR 275.804 million (i.e. 0,6 % of Croatia's GNI) the disaster does not qualify as a “major natural disaster” according to Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002. However, Croatia was affected by the same flooding disaster which led to the major disaster in Hungary. Therefore, the condition set out in Article 2(2) second subparagraph of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, whereby a country affected by the same major disaster as a neighbouring country may exceptionally benefit from Solidarity Fund aid, was found to be met. As a country in the process of negotiating its accession to the EU Croatia is eligible for EU Solidarity Fund assistance. Romania applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after in June and July 2010 the major part of the Romanian territory was affected by heavy flooding and land slides. The disaster caused significant damages to infrastructure, to the agricultural sector and to private and public property. The Romanian authorities estimated the total direct damage at EUR 875 757 770. This amount represents 0,6669 % of Romania's GNI and exceeds the normal threshold for mobilising the Solidarity Fund of EUR 787.935 million (i.e. 0,6 % of GNI based on 2008 data). Therefore the disaster qualifies as a “major natural disaster” and falls within the main field of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002. After verifying that all applications comply with the eligibility criteria of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 105 567 155 for Poland, EUR 20 430 841 for Slovakia, EUR 22 485 772 for Hungary, EUR 5 111 401 for the Czech Republic, EUR 3 825 983 for Croatia and EUR 24 967 741 for Romania resulting in a total amount of EUR 182 388 893 in commitment and payment appropriations. Consequently, in the draft amending budget (DAB No 1/2011 of 14 January 2011) the Commission made the following proposal: Figures - Solidarity Fund Article Item Heading FF Budget 2011 Amending budget No 1/2011 New amount CA PA CA PA CA PA 13 06 Solidarity Fund 13 06 01 European Union Solidarity Fund — Member States 3.2 p.m. p.m. 178 562 910 178 562 910 178 562 910 178 562 910 13 06 02 European Union
