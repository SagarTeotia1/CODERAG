Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2011) Candidate countries must respect and promote the values referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, among which is respect for human rights. In accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Commission relies inter alia on the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms for its monitoring of the observance of human rights in candidate countries. Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) clarify the content of these rights. In the specific case of Greek nationals encountering problems when inheriting and registering property, in particular with application by Turkish authorities of the amended land Registry Law, including interpretation of its provisions of reciprocity, the ECtHR held that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 (peaceful enjoyment of possessions) to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and ordered either the return of the property or financial compensation of the applicants. Turkey is expected to implement these judgments of the ECtHR. The Commission raises these issues with Turkey on all appropriate occasions and at all appropriate levels, and expects Turkey to implement the judgments of the ECtHR and provide any lawful assistance to those concerned.
