2004/C 783 E/050 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2218/03 by Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (2 July 2003) Subject: High-speed rail link between Milan and Genoa and Milan and Verona In its answer of 20 June 2003 to my Written Question P-1826/03 See page 727. on the high-speed rail link (Lyon-Turin-Venice-Trieste-Ljubljana), the Commission failed to respond to the questions concerning shortcomings in the environmental impact assessment procedure for the Milan-Genoa and Milan-Verona links. In particular: — in the case of the Genoa-Milan line, the implications for many archaeological sites (including Libarna), the hydrogeological implications (a 46 km tunnel, quarries, excavation of sections of the River Scrivia), the impact on 4 SCIs (banks of the River Scrivia, Capanne di Marcarolo, Praglia and Monte Gazzo) and one SRI (Arenziarie di Serravalle) and the loss of agricultural land, woodland and countryside have been underestimated; — in the case of the Milan-Verona line, no study is being carried out of the impact on areas of outstanding natural beauty or importance (including ten areas subject to planning constraints in four municipalities in the Verona district) or on the SCI in Laghetto del Frassino, and there has been no discussion of the protection of hydrological resources and noise pollution. What measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that the EIA procedure is applied correctly to these two links, not just in form but in substance, so that it takes account of all the above-mentioned factors which have been excluded from the assessment?
