EU economic policy coordination will work only if it becomes more democratic and less technocratic, said Parliament on Thursday. The economy is too important to remain the sole preserve of finance politicians, says its resolution on the first "European Semester". Addressing the plenary debate on Wednesday, the rapporteur Pervenche Berès (S&D, FR) said: "Even though Member States remain sovereign we must draw lessons from the crisis. One of the lessons is that unilateral action does not work. We now have to ensure that coordination is carried out through a democratic process" More politics, democracy and accountability The main message of the resolution is that the real need to coordinate economies better at EU level cannot be met unless economic policy making becomes more accountable, transparent and democratic. To this end it positions the EU's parliaments, both national and European, at the heart of the drive to strengthen the legitimacy of EU action by involving parliaments more extensively, since only they can ensure an effective democratic and transparent process. Less technocracy The resolution also recommends that national reform programmes and the Commission's Annual Growth Survey should be more ambitious, less technical, and better geared towards growth. The social dimension must also be better integrated, particularly in the recommendations which the Commission makes to each Member State, it adds. The economy is not only about finance The resolution warns against developing economic policies solely through discussion on budgets. To this end, and to set an example, Parliament will organise its work for the next Semester process in close coordination with its economic, employment, budgetary, environmental and industry committees, and also in close cooperation with national parliaments The resolution was passed with 501 votes in favour, 106 against and 11 abstentions. Parliament asks ECB to keep up its Euro-saving work 01-12-2011. The EU needs a European minister of finance and a European treasury to relieve the European Central Bank (ECB) of the exceptional role it is playing in saving the Euro, says a resolution on the ECB's activities in 2010 and ways to combat the crisis, approved on Thursday after a debate with newly-elected ECB President Mario Draghi.
