39. Stresses the importance of adequate technical assistance to help developing countries; also stresses the need to encourage weak and vulnerable economies in the integration of trade into their national development policies and poverty reduction strategies; 40. Calls for a greater flexibility in the transition periods which developing countries are allowed when assuming commitments under regional agreements within the scope of GATT; 41. Notes that agriculture continues to be the principal source of income and employment in most developing countries, especially for the poorest and therefore stresses the importance of the offer made by the EU to abolish its export subsidies by 2013; insists that a parallel move by other WTO members is required; calls on the EU to continue advocating the abandonment of the other - sometimes disguised - forms of export support (export credits, food aid, State enterprises, etc.), in order to remedy the existing trade imbalances between North and South and to make the agriculture of poor countries more profitable; 42. Welcomes the decision to abolish export subsidies in agriculture by 2013 and calls once again for the implementation of decisions already taken to be brought forward significantly; however, as these export subsidies account for only 3.5% of overall EU agricultural support, urges the Commission to continue discussions on finalising the modalities by which agricultural domestic subsidies and tariffs can be reduced in all industrialised countries; 43. Stresses the importance of commodities such as sugar, bananas and cotton for developing countries; calls upon the EU to offer developing countries the necessary assistance to reform their sugar sectors; deplores the lack of an effective solution to the cotton problem in Hong Kong; 44. Recalls the urgent need for stabilisation of commodity prices and a review of supply management mechanisms on international commodity markets; calls on the Commission to support existing proposals of African WTO members to have action on commodity prices included in the current Round of WTO negotiations; 45. Recalls that the maintenance of biodiversity is a key factor for the preservation of nature and for the fight against plant and animal diseases and that therefore the free use of traditional seeds and knowledge in farming by countries or regions is a legitimate choice; 46. Calls on the Commission to ensure more coherence between its trade and cooperation policies to provide targeted assistance to build up trade capacity so as to ensure that export and import growth increase and remain balanced to avoid a renewed debt crisis in the future, and to help the governments of the developing countries - to maintain and develop public services in order to remedy the great scourges linked to poverty, such as epidemics, illiteracy, drinking-water shortages, and the unavailability of sewage treatment; - to foster the conditions necessary for wealth creation, such as access to energy and the development of infrastructures, particularly information and communication technologies; 47. Considers that a distinction needs to be drawn between commercial services and public services; stresses the need for public services to remain outside GATS, particularly those which help to provide access to vital public goods such
