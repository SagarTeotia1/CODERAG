4. Stresses the need for more representatives with a European background within the international standard-setting bodies, in order to legitimate a truly international approach and to meet the need for a balanced consideration of the weight of the European Community, constituting as it does by far the largest economic area and the area with the most entities applying IFRS; believes that all trustees of the IASB should come from nations that have signed up, or intend to sign up, to IFRS; 5. Notes the increasingly theoretical dimension of the IASB's projects, the complexity and theoretical nature of which are such that SMEs, in particular, are not always able to follow them; 6. Notes, furthermore, that practical business aspects are not adequately reflected by the IASB; considers that, from a user's perspective, the financial statement presentation for accounting does not always lend itself to being used for other purposes, e.g. for the purposes of providing financial information to investors, performance monitoring or financial management; 7. Notes the concerns of those who feel that the "decision-usefulness of fair value" approach to accounting, which is increasingly being used by the IASB, can create a disjunction between the picture that is produced by accounts and the actual position of companies, thus reducing the ability of investors to determine the performance of companies; 8. Supports the idea of convergence and equivalence; emphasises, however, that convergence with certain third-country standards must be based on a prior assessment of the merits and impact of such a change on European preparers and users of financial statements and especially on SMEs, and calls on the IASB to bear this in mind when proceeding; believes that convergence would be sufficient if a company's accounts produced in accordance with IFRS could be accepted and recognised under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles without any significant extra cost to companies; 9. Stresses that consistency in adoption and application is essential to the success of the IFRS, but recalls that these are principle-based standards and that, therefore, consistency should not be pursued to the detriment of professional judgement; 10. Underlines that no political mandate has been conferred on the IASB to develop IFRS for SMEs; points out that the EU endorsement procedure applies only to international accounting standards for listed companies and is not envisaged with regard to the IFRS for SMEs; 11. Questions, moreover, whether the draft IFRS for SMEs appropriately reflect the needs of SMEs and the variety of modes and sizes in which they operate; is concerned that the draft was designed with relatively large SMEs in mind (over fifty employees) and asserts that most SMEs are smaller in size; observes that the IFRS involve very much a 'top-down' approach and queries whether this is appropriate for the diversity that exists among SMEs; is concerned that the draft IFRS for SMEs refer to using the lower of historical cost or fair value approach which implies a double calculation; 12. Regrets that the draft IFRS for SMEs do not take adequate account of the fact that the addressees of SMEs' accounts are mainly personal
