Question for written answer E-008710/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Franz Obermayr (NI) (4 October 2011) Subject: Dangerous processes used in the stone-washing of jeans 55 % of jeans sold in Germany now come from Bangladesh or China, given that jeans from Bangladesh costing on average less than EUR 5 per pair are well below the average world price of just under EUR 10. In low wage countries such as Pakistan, Egypt, China or Bangladesh, textile workers are forced work to endanger their health by sandblasting the jeans by hand in order to create the desired ‘stone-washed’ effect. Unprotected sandblasting creates deposits of silica dust in the lungs, which leads to scarring, commonly known as silicosis, and in due course to death by asphyxiation. 1. Is the Commission aware of the working conditions of textile workers in Egypt, Bangladesh, China and Pakistan? 2. What steps is the Commission taking to improve these working conditions? 3. Are the working conditions for textile workers in these countries a subject for negotiation in bilateral treaties such as trade agreements and tariff reductions? If not, why not? 4. Is the Commission planning to ban the import of jeans sandblasted by hand without the appropriate protective clothing? If not, why not? 5. Are the fundamental principles of ‘fair trade’ — i.e. fair wages, decent working conditions, environmentally-friendly production and a rejection of bonded sweatshop and child labour — matters for negotiation in bilateral treaties such as trade agreements and tariff reductions? If not, why not? 6. Does the Commission intend to draw up a black list of textile companies which carry on such practices? If so, which companies will be listed? If not, why not?
