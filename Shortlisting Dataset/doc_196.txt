rules. Secondly, the powers of national courts need to be restricted to the application of Articles 81(1) and 82; 4. Considers that the network of national competition authorities must be provided with a public-law statute creating a clear relationship among the NCAs and between the Commission and the NCAs. Calls for the new Member States also to be involved in this network; 5. Considers that European competition law is the only law applicable to competition agreements with cross-border effects; 6. Considers that safeguards of due process are extremely important in cases dealt with by the Commission, particularly since a single body deals with all the decision - making stages. Calls on the Commission to consider carefully its arrangements in this respect and to examine whether improvements may be made, for example in the supervision of procedural rules; 7. Welcomes the Commission’s policy seeking to rationalise and modernise the supervision of state aid, but notes that decentralisation of supervision must not result in the uniformity of the aid policy of the internal market being impaired; 8. Calls, finally, for clear and high-quality legislation in the field of competition; considers that the democratic legitimacy of legislation which has such a profound impact on the European Union’s economic order requires that the European Parliament also be given the right of co-decision in this legislative area; 9. Welcomes the Commission’s announced intention in the context of the Green Paper on mergers to consider the most appropriate test for the Community merger regime. Considers that it is important that mergers which significantly lessen competition to the detriment of consumers should be the subject of control, whether or not they create a dominant position.
