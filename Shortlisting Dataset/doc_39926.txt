Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (16 August 2010) On 19 January 2010, the Ecofin Council invited the Commission to develop, in cooperation with the Greek statistical authorities, an action plan to tackle statistical, institutional and governance deficiencies in the Greek statistical system. The action plan consists of three pillars aiming to improve the institutional and governance framework of the Greek statistical system, enhance its capacity, and improve the Greek public finance statistics. The implementation of the action plan is closely monitored by the Commission (Eurostat). Also, a high level expert, appointed by the Commission, provides on a continuous basis his assistance to the Greek statistical authorities on the implementation of the recent law that established the New Greek statistical system, and coordinates the overall statistical assistance foreseen to be provided to the Greek authorities in the short and medium term. Furthermore, a Project Steering Group, composed of the Director General of Eurostat, the President of the new Hellenic Statistical Authority, an advisor to the Greek finance minister and a representative of the Bank of Greece, has been set up to urge and monitor progress in the implementation of the said action plan. The Commission (Eurostat) is monitoring on an ongoing basis the implementation of the abovementioned action plan and, in this context, the Greek statistical authorities are expected to update it when an action is completed and to provide the Commission (Eurostat) with reports on the progress made.
