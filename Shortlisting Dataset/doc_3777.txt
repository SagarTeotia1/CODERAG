WRITTEN QUESTION E-1294/07 by Ashley Mote (ITS) to the Commission (14 March 2007) Subject: Foreign drivers on UK roads Given the huge numbers of foreign-registered private and commercial vehicles now on the roads of the United Kingdom, does the Commission understand the practical impossibility of enforcing UK traffic laws? Does the Commission appreciate the expensive and complicated process of identifying drivers and owners from other Member States' governments who are not always ready and willing to provide information? Does the Commission realise how low is the prospect of collecting fines for minor infringements in such circumstances? Does the Commission also understand the growing anger of UK drivers of all classes of vehicles who see foreign drivers ‘getting away with it’, while UK drivers are obliged to pay their fines and incur penalties on their driving licences?
