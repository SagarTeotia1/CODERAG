WRITTEN QUESTION E-3404/08 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (17 June 2008) Subject: Protection of flowering almonds In certain regions of the Portuguese interior, namely the Beira Interior and Trás-os-Montes, there are still large areas covered by flowering almonds, in particular around the locality of Vila Nova de Foz Côa. In the 2005 marketing year, of some 13 000 ha officially given over to nut cultivation, more than 11 000 were located in that area, mostly planted with almonds. However, in 2006 the sector was restructured and the eligible area was reduced to 8 000 ha; for the 2007 marketing year the reported figure is expected to be approximately 9 000. Fresh draft applications are now being prepared for new almond groves, with the support of the local communities in view of their importance for protecting employment, production, biodiversity and social cohesion in the region. When I recently visited the nut producers' cooperation Coamêndoa, the cultivators reaffirmed the need to guarantee aid for the sector, both now and in the future. Can the Commission state: 1. what measures are planned to guarantee the continuity of support for this sector, so as to ensure that the viability of investments, the permanent presence of cultivators in the region and an increase in the area under cultivation; 2. recalling that the EU's almond production falls short of its needs, what other forms of support could be granted with a view to encouraging the replanting of the areas lost to cultivation because aid did not arrive on time?
