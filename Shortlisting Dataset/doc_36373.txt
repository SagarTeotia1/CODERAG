WRITTEN QUESTION E-0727/10 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) to the Commission (16 February 2010) Subject: China's recourse to the WTO following European trade protection measures (footwear) Last December, after a thorough investigation by the Commission, the EU decided to extend the validity of anti-dumping taxes on imports of footwear from China and Vietnam for a 15‑month period. Naturally some voices were raised from within the EU opposing this extension. However, given China’s and Vietnam’s confirmed perseverance in dumping practices, and given the damage to EU manufacturers, if the EU had not taken countermeasures this would have signified tolerance of unfair competition against European producers. Can the Commission say whether there is any truth in the information that was published in the press regarding China’s request to the WTO to activate the dispute settlement mechanism? Given the conclusions of its investigation, can the Commission confirm that, in consultations with the Chinese authorities, it will strongly defend the legitimacy of these trade protection measures and will not give way to any threat of Chinese countermeasures?
