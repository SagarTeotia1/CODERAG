Question for written answer E-008514/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (26 September 2011) Subject: The Commission report ‘Education at a glance 2011’ and Greek investments in education In a press release on 13 September 2011 http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1027&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EL&guiLanguage=en the Commission unveiled a report highlighting the need for effective funding of schools and universities. In this press release, Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said: ‘35 % of jobs in the EU will require high level qualifications by 2020, so it's vital that we continue to invest properly in schools and universities. Education must remain a top priority for the EU, even in a tough economic climate.’ At the same time, page 92 of the draft medium-term financial strategy 2012-15 for Greece, provides, inter alia , for reductions in spending on education by 2015 in excess of EUR 1 billion (from EUR 7 480 billion in 2009 to EUR 6 455 billion in 2015). In view of the above, will the Commission say: — Does it agree with these spending cuts on education, given the Commission's position on the high priority of education even in these difficult economic times? — Does it believe that these spending cuts endanger the objectives of the ‘Europe 2020’ strategy to which Greece is committed?
