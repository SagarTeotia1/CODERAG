Question for written answer E-001282/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Matteo Salvini (EFD) (10 February 2012) Subject: Issues related to the Services Directive The implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC is creating numerous problems for Italian seaside tourism. Businesses operating in this sector have unique characteristics in that they carry out tasks normally performed by public authorities, such as those relating to orders, privacy protection, and water safety for all clients and bathers, and are consequently similar to ‘private security services’, which are excluded from the scope of the Services Directive pursuant to its Article 2(2)(k). Furthermore, unlike what happens with any other form of enterprise, if seaside tourism activities lose state concessions, this means depriving a firm of its own business. Finally, conserving the coast is of the utmost importance for tourism in Italy, and even more so in the current economic context. In the light of Parliament’s resolution of 27 September 2011, which calls on the Commission to take those factors into consideration, as well as Article 134 TFEU and the provision that there shall be no prejudice to the existing system of property ownership in the Member States, will the Commission consider excluding the activities carried out at Italian seaside resorts from the application of the Services Directive? If this is not possible, what measures can the Commission take in order to soften the negative repercussions for businesses and guarantee that this sector’s unique features are taken into consideration?
