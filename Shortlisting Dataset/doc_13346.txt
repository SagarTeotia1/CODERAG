Treaty in 2007 Resolution on the Commission Green Paper entitled ‘Towards a European energy supply strategy’ ( COM(2000) 769 – C5-0142/2001 – 2001/2071(COS)). and for a special conference to be organised to revise the Treaty. AMENDMENTS The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following amendments in its report: Text proposed by the Commission Not yet published in OJ. Amendments by Parliament Amendment 1 RECITAL 3 a (new) (3a) Loans from the Euratom Guarantee Fund to third countries (non-member states) will in future, as hitherto, be granted only in accordance with Council Decision 94/179/Euratom, Official Journal of the European Communities No L 84/41 of 21 March 1994, which means that funds cannot be lent to a third country to finance new nuclear power stations but only for measures to increase the level of safety at existing nuclear power installations. Justification If this is inserted as new text in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94, the reference to Council Decision 94/179/Euratom should be included in order to make it clear that no changes are being made in the rules on Guarantee Fund loans to third countries. Amendment 2 ARTICLE 1, POINT 3 Article 7 (EC, Euratom No 2728/94) The Commission shall, by no later than 30 June of the following financial year, send to the European Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors an annual report on the situation of the Fund and the management thereof in the previous year. The Commission shall, by no later than 30 May of the following financial year, send to the European Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors an annual report on the situation of the Fund and the management thereof in the previous year. Justification The Commission considers it necessary to extend the deadline for submission of its annual report because of the amount of information it has to contain and the complexity of the process leading up to its submission. The date of 30 May would seem to satisfy the Commission’s concerns – by giving it an extra two months – and also the requirements of the parliamentary calendar in connection with consideration of this annual report.
