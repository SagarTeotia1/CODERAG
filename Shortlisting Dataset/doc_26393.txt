Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (28 March 2008) Under a first Council directive Council Directive 92/6/EEC of 10 February 1992 on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community (OJ L 57, 2.3.1992). , it has been compulsory since 1992 to fit the heaviest vehicles with devices limiting their speed (to under 90 km/h for HGVs and under 100 km/h for coaches). The Commission has not registered any decline in road safety — in particular as regards accidents involving HGVs — since this legislation came into effect. In fact, the impact of the directive in terms of environmental protection and road safety was deemed sufficiently positive for its scope to be extended to all public transport vehicles and HGVs See, for example, the explanatory memorandum to the Commission’s proposal (COM(2001)318 final). . The obligation to fit HGVs of 3.5 tonnes and over and coaches with eight seats or more (in addition to the driver’s) with speed limiters set at 90 km/h and 100 km/h respectively was introduced by Directive 2002/85/EC, which was adopted by the Parliament and the Council on the basis of a proposal from the Commission Directive 2002/85/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 amending Council Directive 92/6/EEC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community (OJ L 327, 4.12.2002). . Like all Community legislation, this directive refers only to the decimal metric system. Nevertheless, there is nothing in it to prevent the UK authorities from obliging UK truck operators at national level to display vehicles’ speed limits in miles per hour — just as the authorities in other Member States arrange for speed limits to be displayed on vehicles according to the system used in their countries. This legislation concerns equipment to be fitted on vehicles — it has no bearing on road signs and there is thus no risk of confusing car drivers as to the general speed limit in force. The Commission is also confident that UK drivers do not confuse kilometres with miles in the few cases in question and will not be under the impression that foreign vehicles with speed limit plates in kilometres are allowed to travel on UK motorways at 90 mph, in the case of trucks, or 100 mph, in the case of coaches, i.e. 20 or 30 mph faster than the limit for cars.
