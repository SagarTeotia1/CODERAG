Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (6 April 2011) The Netherlands is under an obligation arising from the Renewable Energy Directive Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC, OJ L 140, 5.6.2009. to generate a 14 % share of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 and to introduce measures effectively designed to reach this target. The Netherlands indicated in its National Renewable Energy Action Plan Available at: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/transparency_platform/action_plan_en.htm that its renewable energy share should be 14.5 % in 2020. The Commission is currently completing its evaluation of all the National Renewable Energy Action Plans and is soliciting additional information or clarification from a number of Member States, including the Netherlands. The Commission will take appropriate action should Member States not comply with the requirements of the directive.
