WRITTEN QUESTION E-5037/06 by Mary McDonald (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (23 November 2006) Subject: Planning applicants by ‘blood’ Can the Commission say if decisions by Wicklow County Council to refuse planning permission on the grounds that the applicant ‘has no links or bloodline in the area, and that his case does not merit any social or economic consideration as he is not a local’ are in breach of any EU law or directive? If so what action does the Commission propose to take?
