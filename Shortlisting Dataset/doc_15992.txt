Answer given by Mr Šefčovič on behalf of the Commission (1 June 2010) 1. Questions related to the follow up of the European Transparency Initiative (ETI) are covered within the Commission by the Vice‑President for Interinstitutional Relations and Administration. 2 and 3. The Commission does not envisage establishing a hierarchy between the various items which have been subject to the adoption of a number of transparency measures under the European Transparency Initiative. They are all important for citizens. At this stage the priority is on the concrete and full implementation of these measures in order to effectively provide citizens with the benefit of the higher degree of transparency sought to be achieved by the Initiative. 4. As part of the implementation of the ETI, it is planned to agree, prepare and develop the single register of interest representatives which both the Parliament and the Commission have the objective to set up. 5 and 6. Since the launching of the structured framework for the activities of interest representatives (lobbying) to the European institutions, the Commission has devoted two agents to this action.
