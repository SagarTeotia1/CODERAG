the basis of this screening, concrete recommendations for sectoral actions are made to promote growth, productivity and competitiveness in each of the sectors analysed. In addition, 7 major cross-sectoral policy initiatives are proposed, in order to meet the common challenges and reinforce the synergies: · Intellectual Property Rights and Counterfeiting Initiative · High-Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment · External Aspects of Competitiveness and Market Access · New Legislative Simplification Programme · Improving Sectoral Skills · Managing Structural Change in Manufacturing · Integrated European approach to Industrial Research and Innovation. Furthermore, the Commission proposes to set up a number of new sector-specific initiatives: · Pharmaceuticals Forum · Mid-Term Review of Life Sciences and Biotechnology Strategy · High-Level Group on the Chemicals Industry · High-Level Group on the Defence Industry · European Space Programme · Taskforce on ICT Competitiveness · Mechanical Engineering Policy Dialogue. Your Rapporteur welcomes the Communication. While rejecting a return to a selective interventionist approach, the Communication takes account of the specific context of individual sectors and proposes a tailor-made combination of policies to suit the particular opportunities and challenges they face. Through linking together under a single initiative a number of different policy dimensions of key relevance to industry, the horizontal initiatives could provide increased coherence and integration between policies, thereby enhancing competitiveness. Your Rapporteur wishes to stress the importance of the following and would welcome additional actions in that direction: · an in-depth analysis of the situation and the prospects of manufacturing in the new Member States; · the role of education, training and knowledge transfer in shaping the current industry structure more towards a knowledge based, innovative society; · the coordination between national (and local) industrial policy and Community actions; · the necessary involvement of all stakeholders, and in particular social partners, in shaping the future of sectors; · the concrete implementation of the cross-sectoral initiatives, resulting in better framework conditions for the manufacturing industries; · the significant rise of unfair competition the manufacturing industry is facing from non-compliant or counterfeit products on the EU market; · the role of the EIB and EIF in the sectoral initiatives, where lack of financing was identified as a bottleneck; Your Rapporteur strongly believes that the future of EU manufacturing industry lies in a continuous focus towards higher-value and higher quality products. This requires adaptability on company level, structural adjustment of the value chain and a shift towards a more knowledge-based, innovative production. This process should be done in close cooperation with the social partners and, where possible, financial contribution from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be aimed towards this kind of restructuring and modernization of European manufacturing sectors. 15.5.2006 OPINION of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing – towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy ( 2006/2003(INI) ) Draftswoman: Ilda Figueiredo SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its
