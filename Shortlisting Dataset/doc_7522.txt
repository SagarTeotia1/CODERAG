its aims to date and the gender pay gap and lack of provisions concerning the reconciliation of work and family life and public childcare services remain key concerns for European workers, I. whereas temporary employment has grown faster in Member States where changes have been made to the relevant rules to encourage temporary employment and whereas non-standard employment may be beneficial if it suits the circumstances of workers and is voluntary; but whereas, at present, much non-standard employment is not chosen and many workers are falling outside the scope of fundamental labour and social rights, thereby undermining the principle of equal treatment, J. whereas only 60% of those who had taken up non-standard contractual arrangements in 1997 had standard contracts in 2003, indicating that 40% of non-standard workers still do not benefit from full employment status after 6 years; whereas this concerns in particular young people who increasingly enter into employment via alternative forms of employment with working and social conditions which are much more insecure than average, and who increasingly risk remaining trapped on the margins of the labour market, K. whereas the recent growth in non-standard contracts has brought with it differences in working conditions in terms of health and safety that can lead to poorer working conditions and higher accident rates, L. whereas, given that inequalities generate direct and indirect economic costs and – on the contrary – equal treatment generates competitive advantages, the establishment of equal treatment constitutes a major strategic contribution to social and economic development; whereas, furthermore, the European Union cannot afford to dispense with the energy and the productive capacity of women, who make up half of the population, M. whereas women are now confronted with a triple bind, i.e. to increase their labour market participation, to give birth to more children, and to assume more and more caring responsibilities within their families; whereas it is nearly always women who are required to make the compromises necessary to fit work around the family’s needs and who experiences high levels of stress and anxiety because of the combination of working and caring roles, N. whereas it is a fact that hundreds of thousands of women have no choice but to accept irregular conditions of employment, because they are domestic workers outside their own household or have caring responsibilities for elderly family members, O. whereas workers who have non-standard contracts are often at higher risk than their colleagues in other forms of employment due to lack of training, not knowing about risks, and unawareness of rights, P. whereas all workers should benefit from adequate employment security and protection, independently of their contractual arrangements, Q. whereas in a number of Member States collective bargaining helps the labour market to operate flexibly and is a key element of labour law as well as an essential regulatory tool; whereas conditions concerning industrial relations must be respected and traditions of industrial relations and level of trade union membership vary in the Member States; whereas Member States should promote social dialogue between social partners at all levels because this can be an
