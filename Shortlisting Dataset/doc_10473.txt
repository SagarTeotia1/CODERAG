WRITTEN QUESTION E-2297/06 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 May 2006) Subject: Block insurance policy in Scotland The Law Society of Scotland maintains a master policy to provide indemnity for all Scottish solicitors. The arrangement formally requires all solicitors in Scotland to purchase professional indemnity through this master policy. Has the Commission made any analysis of any potential anti-competitive aspects of such a policy? Does the Commission consider that such a practice could act as an unnecessary restriction on competition between solicitors and foreign lawyers practising in Scotland, given the inability of Scottish solicitors to choose their own provider for professional indemnity insurance and to perhaps seek such insurance on more competitive terms than offered by the master policy, as well as the impact on the investigation of complaints? What is the Commission's view of this practice, and can the Commission state what would be the implications for the draft Services Directive, as recently amended by the Commission on 4 April 2006?
