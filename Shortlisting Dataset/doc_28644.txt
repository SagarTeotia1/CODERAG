ORAL QUESTION H-0069/04 for Question Time at the part-session in March I 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Camilo Nogueira Román to the Commission Subject: Galician fisheries and the European Fisheries Control Agency What position will the Commission adopt with regard to the concerns, expressed by the Galician fisheries sector to Commissioner Fischler during his working visit to Vigo, that it would be appropriate for the Agency to take on duties relating to research and the improvement of the scientific principles governing the state of fishery resources and to consider the possible introduction of a system for the exchange of fishing quotas between Community enterprises? According to the Galician proposal, this would make its responsibilities similar to those of other agencies, such as the ones dealing with the internal market or the promotion of social dialogue.
