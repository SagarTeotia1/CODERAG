Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (22 April 2008) The Commission welcomes the opening of the Ledra Street crossing in Nicosia on 3 April 2008, forty-four years after it had been closed. The opening of the crossing marks an important step forward in building confidence between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. The EU has made more than EUR 100 000 available for the safety works necessary for the opening of the crossing as the first phase of an EU‑financed and UNDP-managed project and for the second phase, which will take about three months, and will upgrade the area to restore Ledra Street as the vibrant centre of Nicosia where all Cypriots can come together. The Commission furthermore already took all necessary legal steps for the opening of other crossing points such as at Limnitis-Pyrgos by adding these crossings to Annex I of the Green Line Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 of 29 April 2004 on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol 10 to the Act of Accession, OJ L 161, 30.4.2004. .
