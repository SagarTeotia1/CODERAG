WRITTEN QUESTION E-0241/05 by Dan Jørgensen (PSE) to the Commission (2 February 2005) Subject: Cross-compliance in accordance with Article 6(2) of the Directive on the conservation of natural habitats Article 6(2) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora provides for the possibility of applying cross-compliance where farmers are in breach of EU environment rules in that area. However, in several Member States there are considerable problems with the implementation in national law of cross-compliance pursuant to Article 6(2). Denmark, for example, issued an implementing order between Christmas and New Year which, in my view, does not meet the requirements. Would the Commission therefore say: — whether Article 6(2) of the above Directive is directly applicable if national implementation is not consistent with that Directive, — whether it takes the view that Danish implementing orders 1519 and 1514 of 22 December 2004 meet the requirements of Directive 92/43/EEC, and — what initiatives it will take if the Danish implementing orders do not meet the requirements of that Directive?
