European education and training’ ( COM(2006)0481 ), – having regard to the research paper entitled ‘Guiding at-risk youth through learning to work’ (Cedefop, Luxembourg, 2010), – having regard to the briefing note entitled ‘Jobs in Europe to become more knowledge- and skills-intensive’ (Cedefop, February 2010), – having regard to the briefing note entitled ‘Skill mismatch in Europe’ (Cedefop, June 2010), – having regard to the publication entitled ‘Working and ageing’ (Cedefop, Luxembourg, 2010), – having regard to Articles 165 and 166 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, relating to education, vocational training, youth, and sport, – having regard to Rule 48 of its Rules of Procedure, – having regard to the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the opinions of the Committee on Culture and Education, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality ( A7-0082/2011 ), A. whereas the youth unemployment rate is now 21 %, which is twice as high as the general rate of unemployment at EU level and is one of the most pressing challenges in Europe, and is thus one of the goals being pursued to reduce the school drop-out rate below 10 %; whereas another goal is to increase women's participation in the labour market by 70 % by 2020; and whereas education and training are key factors for successful participation in the labour market and the ability to make life decisions, given a situation where more than 5.5 million young Europeans are without work, are at risk of social exclusion and face poverty and a lack of opportunity after leaving school, and many young people are forced to accept precarious jobs, with low salaries and reduced social insurance cover, which affects their health and safety in the workplace, B. whereas while 58.9 % of the university qualifications awarded in the European Union go to women, the corresponding figure at PhD level is just 43 % and it is lower again at full professor level, and whereas only 15 % of Grade A full professors are women, C. whereas the Commission's Communication entitled ‘A new impetus for European cooperation in Vocational Education and Training to support the Europe 2020 strategy’ ( COM(2010)0296 ) failed to take the gender dimension into account, D. whereas the transition from education to work and between jobs is a structural challenge for workers all over the EU; whereas, therefore, transition security is an essential element to motivate workers for training outside the workplace; whereas quality apprenticeships have a largely positive impact on young people's access to employment, E. whereas early unemployment has lasting ill-effects, including a higher risk of future unemployment and lower lifetime earnings, F. whereas demography and longevity are such that working lives will, as a matter of course, be longer and more varied, and whereas inter alia lifelong learning, education, the new digital economy, the adaptation to new technologies and the implementation of the EU 2020 goals are ways to secure employment and a better standard of living, G. whereas
