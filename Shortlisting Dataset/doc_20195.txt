Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (11 October 2011) Since the Action Programme for Reduction of Administrative Burdens was presented by the Commission in January 2007, the Commission has tabled proposals that would reduce administrative burden by more than 31 %. The European Parliament and Council have adopted proposals amounting to a reduction of administrative burdens by 22 %. There are currently 13 proposals pending with the Parliament and Council. If these are adopted, the 25 % reduction target will be reached.
