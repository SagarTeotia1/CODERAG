States; 5. Calls for greater consistency among Community programmes and policies in order to achieve the Roadmap’s objectives and ensure that its priorities are fully integrated in the new 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework; acknowledges that delivering the 20 % energy efficiency target would allow the EU to reduce its internal CO 2 emissions by 25 % or more by 2020, and that this reduction would still be on a cost-effective path towards the long-term 2050 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 % from 1990 levels; notes that, according to the Roadmap, a less ambitious approach would result in significantly higher costs over the entire period; recalls, however, that the cost-effectiveness of investments should always be measured in the light of Member State budgets; 6. Recalls that in the run-up to the Durban Climate Conference, the European Parliament called for the CO 2 reduction target to be increased above 20 % by 2020; 7. Stresses that clear emissions targets will stimulate the early investments needed in R&D, demonstration and deployment for low-emitting technologies, and that defining a long-term strategy is paramount to ensuring that the EU is on track to achieve its agreed objective of reducing emissions by 2050; 8. Calls on the Commission to present a cost-benefit analysis of meeting the proposed pathway at Member State level, taking into account national circumstances stemming from different technological development, as well as the necessary investments (and the attendant social acceptability) and the existence of a wider range of possible global conditions; 9. Underlines that moving to a low carbon economy would have significant potential for creating additional jobs, while securing economic growth and providing a competitive advantage for European industry; 10. Recalls that the transition to clean technologies would drastically reduce air pollution and thus ensure significant health and environmental benefits The i nternational dimension 11. Notes that the worldwide development and application of low carbon technologies is increasing rapidly, and that it is essential for Europe’s future competitiveness to increase levels of investment in research, development and application in relation to these technologies; 12. Notes the shift in sustainable scientific and technological innovation away from Europe to other parts of the world, which may lead to the EU losing its technological leadership in the field and turn it into a net importer of these technologies and the related finished products; emphasises, therefore, the importance of European added value for the development and domestic production of technologies and products, in particular for energy efficiency and renewables; 13. Emphasises that China is the world leader in terms of installed wind farm capacity, that Chinese and Indian producers are among the top ten wind turbine producers, and that China and Taiwan currently manufacture most of the world’s photovoltaic panels; calls on the Commission and the Member States to take steps to promote the eco-efficient development and production in the EU of these technologies and of the new and innovative technologies that are needed to achieve the ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; 14. Calls on the EU to continue to play
