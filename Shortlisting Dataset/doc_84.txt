transport, especially involving added-value ICT solutions to existing problems at local level; 22. Calls on the Commission to publish a ‘best experiences’ guide for local authorities concerning energy-efficient solutions to traffic management and to cooperate with industry representatives on a list of ‘eco-innovations’ in order to make eco-driving a reality (such as an indicator showing economic fuel consumption, software that monitors internal tyre pressure, a dynamic eco-navigation system, driving-speed regulation, adaptive cruise control and real-time estimation of environmental impact on the basis of driving profiles); 23. Urges the Commission to promote initiatives to raise the awareness of local authorities, including the use of ICT modelling tools in city planning and housing management and in the provision of energy-efficient digital services; welcomes the Covenant of Mayors initiative, which brings together in a permanent network the mayors of Europe’s most pioneering cities; calls for this initiative to pay particular attention to using ICTs to improve energy efficiency; 24. Calls on the Member States to pay suitable attention to the use of ICTs in manufacturing industry and on the Commission to give the Member States greater access to examples of research and development projects which incorporate a key ICT contribution to manufacturing industry, upon which 70% of jobs in the EU directly or indirectly depend, thereby promoting best practice examples for modernising the EU manufacturing industry; 25. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to support and encourage the ICT industry in reducing its carbon footprint by complying with the highest efficiency and innovation standards throughout entire product life-cycles, and by monitoring energy consumption at every stage of its supply chain; encourages the development of voluntary initiatives to reduce energy consumption in the ICT sector; recommends, further, the use of software and operating systems that consume the least energy; 26. Calls on the Member States to invest in energy-efficiency education, which should start at school by cultivating eco-consciousness among future consumers; calls, further, on the Commission and the Member States to provide massive support for education and training programmes in the interests of supplying an adequate number of trained ICT specialists and to encourage individuals and firms to adopt efficient practices through target-driven education and training aimed at using equipment efficiently, quantifying the resulting energy savings and developing green skills; 27. Calls on the Commission and the PlaceNameplaceMemberPlaceType States to create a more favourable regulatory environment with better access to finance for SMUs that can play a key role in implementing ICT-based solutions for energy efficiency; 28. Welcomes the extension of the scope of the Energy Star cooperation programme with the United States and the inclusion in the implementing regulation of a mandatory public procurement provision; urges the Commission to move negotiations on further products forward; 29. Notes that new technologies and approaches can in certain cases lead to an increase in energy consumption compared to the systems they are replacing; calls on the Commission and the Member States to take steps to ensure that consumers are made fully aware of the energy-efficiency performance of innovative systems compared to the technologies that are being
