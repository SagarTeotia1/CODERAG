WRITTEN QUESTION E-5353/08 by Koenraad Dillen (NI) to the Commission (6 October 2008) Subject: Corruption in Equatorial Guinea In poor countries, corruption represents a humanitarian disaster. That is the opinion expressed by the NGO Transparency International in its recent annual report. It states that corruption can make the difference between life and death when it concerns such things as clean water or healthcare. Of the world’s ten most corrupt countries, six are in Africa: in joint 171st place (with the Democratic Republic of Congo) is Equatorial Guinea. Has Equatorial Guinea received aid from the European Union in the last four years? What amounts were involved? What checks have there been on the money spent? What consultation has taken place in recent years between the Commission and Equatorial Guinea to address the problem of corruption?
