Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (18 January 2008) The Commission is aware that, following the events of 1974, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus lost effective control over the sea ports in the northern part of Cyprus (Famagusta, Kyrenia, Karavostassi) and thus declared them prohibited and closed for all vessels. Each state has the sovereign right to determine which ports are open for international transports. However, it is the Commission's understanding that there is no prohibition under general international law to enter and leave seaports in the northern part of Cyprus. The issue should therefore be solved bilaterally between the Republic of Cyprus and the Syrian Arab Republic. The Commission is not in a position to intervene with the authorities of Syria in this matter.
