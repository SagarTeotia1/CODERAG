WRITTEN QUESTION E-2500/10 by Mara Bizzotto (EFD) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Arrests of bishops, priests and Christian believers in India According to a number of Catholic agencies, on 5 March 2010, near the Indian city of Chennai (Tamil Nadu state, southern India), the Indian police arrested hundreds of people including nuns, Christian priests and three Catholic bishops (Monsignor Malayappan Chinnappa, Archbishop of Madras-Mylapore, Monsignor Peter Fernando, Archbishop of Madurai and Monsignor Anthonisamy Neethinathan). The reason for the arrests was apparently the participation of the clergymen in a campaign to raise awareness of the rights of the Christian and Muslim ‘untouchables’ (Dalits). The arrests took place during a meeting involving the clergymen and thousands of people — the closing event of the entire campaign — which had begun a month earlier in Kanyakumari, in the south of the country, and which culminated in a peaceful march of over 500 km. According to the organisers of the demonstration, the event aimed to raise awareness among the Indian people and authorities of the serious marginalisation to which the caste of the ‘untouchables’, mostly made up of Christians and Muslims, is subjected. The Christian Dalits are apparently victims of a form of religious discrimination, since important social inclusion measures have not yet been applied to them, while the Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh Dalits have for decades benefited from such measures under the law. The international community has not yet expressed its views, if not marginally, on the profound deterioration of the Christian ‘untouchables’ in India and their degrading living conditions. Is the Commission aware of the arrests reported by the Catholic agencies? Has it complained to the Indian federal and state authorities? How does the Commission consider it can take action to improve the living conditions of Christians in India and safeguard Christians' physical integrity and respect for their right of religious freedom?
