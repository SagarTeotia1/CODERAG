Agreement at the level of a partnership as there are no direct financial implications for the EU. However, as a developing country, it would still have the right to participate in EU activities in the field of research connected with development. CONCLUSIONS The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy calls on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following points in its motion for a resolution: 1. The committee agrees with the view expressed by the rapporteur of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and endorses his approval of the conclusion of the Agreement. 2 . We highlight the fact that India is the world's largest democracy and that EU-India relations go back to the early 1960s. 3. We note that the essential objective of the Agreement is to encourage and facilitate co-operative research activities in science and technology fields of common interest between the Community and India, but that the Agreement does not affect the participation of India, as a developing country, in Community activities in the field of research for development. 4. Supports the EU position that it is important to upgrade and institutionalise the political dialogue with India, including dialogue in security matters, and to further our co-operation in other spheres. 5. While being in favour of the signing and conclusion of the Agreement, the draftsman also draws attention to the need to include human rights in the wider discussions taking place between the EU and India. 6. We would also point out that upholding and strengthening the international regime to prevent nuclear proliferation is a key point of the EU's foreign policy agenda. 7. In conclusion, the draftsman welcomes the fact that discussion on Kashmir is on the agenda of the Summits referred to.
