for investment which has to be met. At the same time the EBRD stresses, however, that the capacity of these countries to absorb investment is still limited. This problem must be considered afresh. Absorptive capacity also depends on the financing arrangements. It may be that the capacity to absorb large-scale projects really is limited, because administrative institutions are inefficient. On the other hand, focusing on smaller projects and setting up micro-credit banks can help to overcome current obstacles. Your rapporteur wishes to express a more critical view of the two-edged sword that the EBRD's political mandate represents. Democracy can prevail in the States in transition only if the underlying economic and social conditions permit it to do so. In other words, the EBRD's primary role must be to contribute to economic development and improved living conditions for all. In this respect, its work is very constructive. However, were the Bank to set itself up as the herald of ultra-liberalism, were it to set itself the goal of subjecting the governments of the States in transition to the dogma of nothing but privatisation and uncontrolled liberalisation, this would be a misinterpretation of its role. We are all familiar with the devastating effects of the IMF's activities in developing countries. We have experienced the failure of the much-acclaimed policy pursued by international organisations in Russia, when the attempt to set up a capitalist structure ended in a government of kleptocrats and impoverishment of the public. The EBRD must respect the decisions taken by all democratically elected governments, particularly where the division between the public and private sectors is concerned. In addition, the EBRD should pay more attention in its work to social cohesion, and especially employment. It is really rather surprising, after all, that there is no place for employment in the long list of criteria for assessing completed projects, yet the retention and creation of jobs is a decisive factor in the process of transition, because economic success and political stability are thereby combined. It would also be beneficial if the EBRD were to measure and assess the effects of its operations on the macroeconomic development of the countries in transition. This is undoubtedly not an easy thing to do, but it is essential, since the Bank is supposed to report not only to its shareholders but also to institutions such as the European Parliament. Accordingly, your rapporteur calls on the EBRD to give more consideration to employment in its strategy.
