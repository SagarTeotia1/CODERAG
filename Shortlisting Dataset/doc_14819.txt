tradables and technological change in subsistence-oriented activities; notes that this could be combined with countering the problem of "enclave growth" through the development of trade-related infrastructure, such as internal transport and communications, increased domestic market integration and the development of new exports, including manufactured goods and tourism; 25. Emphasizes the need for the EU to engage further in initiatives concerning Corporate Social Responsibility in order to arrive at a concept of binding and accountable rules for EU companies trading and producing in third countries in accordance with human rights and ILO standards; 26. Invites the EU to include in particular the consequences of trade in waste in its Sustainability Impact Assessments of trade agreements in order to arrive at rules against harmful waste; 27. Considers it necessary to develop trade relations among developing countries, to develop the "South-South" inter-regional dimension, to establish local markets and to increase the access of populations to goods and services, but particularly to secure access to essential services such as drinking water, health, energy, transport and education through public investment programmes in line with the MDGs ; 28. Considers that the lack of economic integration and the high tariff and non tariff barriers to trade between developing countries act as a brake on all potential factors of development in these countries; considers that wider opening-up of trade between the countries of the South would produce benefits for the developing countries; notes, however, that LDCs may become marginalised in South-South trade and, therefore, encourages regional FDI, technology transfer and cheaper finance from more advanced developing countries directed to the LDCs and triangular relationships with developed countries as well as special provisions within regional agreements; points out the importance of creating regional markets; considers that more advanced countries should set a good example with the dismantling of trade barriers in order to promote trade between poor countries; 29. Welcomes the implementation of the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative by the European Union, which enables the least developed countries to export all their output to the European market without customs duties or quotas; strongly urges all developed and advanced developing countries to follow this model; welcomes the agreement to this effect reached during the recent WTO negotiations in Hong Kong; regrets, however, that restrictions can still be maintained on products which are of major importance for the least-developed countries; 30. Warns of the real risk that the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative could be fraudulently distorted by means of irregular forms of triangular trade which will dangerously disrupt the balance of markets and the profitability of prices, without any real gains for local populations working in the production sector in poor countries; 31. Urges the Commission to support the opening-up of markets by introducing adequate measures to regulate trade so as to overcome these dangers; with this in view, suggests that the Everything but Arms initiative should be supplemented by a safeguard clause linking the maximum level of exports from the countries concerned to their actual production capacity; also urges the Commission to take rapid steps to secure a substantial improvement in
