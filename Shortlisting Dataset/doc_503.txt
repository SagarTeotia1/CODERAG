Question for written answer E-010427/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (15 November 2011) Subject: Amendment of the Qualification Directive In October 2009, the European Commission submitted a proposal for the recast of the Qualification Directive. This directive, which lays down minimum standards, is now to be amended after long discussions which resulted in a compromise that the European Parliament could also approve. The new text improves the current minimum standards that must be complied with in many areas, for example the protection of the basic rights of women in connection with forced abortion, genital mutilation or rape in situations of conflict or war. Women in these situations are set to receive greater protection under the amended directive The Member States will now be required to take gender-specific aspects fully into consideration when assessing asylum claims. Does the Commission, however, in seeking to protect women from various forms of persecution and from violations of their human rights and basic freedoms, intend to focus not only on treating cases that have already occurred, but also on taking certain preventive measures?
