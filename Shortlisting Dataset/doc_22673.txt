ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0007/06 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Giles Chichester , on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to the Council Subject: Security of supply of energy in the European Union EU energy consumption is projected to grow by 22% in the period 1990 to 2020. In particular, EU consumption of oil is increasing despite a 50% decrease in energy intensity of oil appliances and the use of renewable fuels in industry, transport, heating and the generation of electricity. EU gas demand has risen markedly in both absolute terms and relative to other fuels, where its market share has risen over ten years from 18% to 24% in 2003 and is projected to be 27% by 2020. EU import dependency is projected to rise to 71% by 2030, and there will be an increased demand from third countries which will compete for the energy required by EU Member States. What will the Council do in order to react appropriately to recent developments on the growing energy demand on the one hand, and to geopolitical strategic and diplomatic stability risks, on the other? Furthermore, how can the EU's future independent supply of energy (oil and gas needs) be secured? Having regard to sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply, what other sources of energy can be used if the oil and gas supplies decrease or if supply is vulnerable to geopolitical risks? What is the Council's opinion on the impact of post-2012 Kyoto negotiations on the security of energy supply and the competitiveness of the EU (Lisbon objectives)?
