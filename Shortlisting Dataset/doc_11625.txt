Reply (2 June 2005) The Council welcomes the holding of the Iraqi national elections which reflect the attachment of the Iraqi people to the political process under way, to democratic principles and to the rule of law. The Council pays tribute to the Iraqis, who have shown courage, enthusiasm and determination in taking part in the elections despite a difficult security situation. The Council has taken note of the results announced on 13 February by the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, which establishes that these elections took place in accordance with international standards. The objective of the European Union is a safe, stable, unified, prosperous and democratic Iraq, that upholds human rights and cooperates constructively with its neighbours and with the international community. In order to attain this goal, the European Council presented a comprehensive assistance programme to Iraq on 5 November 2004 and announced further assistance measures at the 21 February GAERC. This programme continues to be implemented together with an additional programme of Community assistance. It included assistance to the elections in January 2005 mainly through support via the UN Trust Fund. It also included support to the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq with three EU electoral experts in Baghdad working with the Electoral Commission and the implementation of a domestic observer training programme in Jordan for 170 Iraqi coordinators and trainers. The EU also stands ready to look at how best to support future elections including through a possible EU observation mission on the ground if security circumstances permit.
