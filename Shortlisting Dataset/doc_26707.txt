ORAL QUESTION H-0119/07 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Simon Coveney to the Council Subject: Burma Common Position In light of the upcoming review of the EU Common Position on Burma, can the Presidency indicate whether or not it will be supporting the renewal of the Common Position and explain the reasons for its support or lack thereof? If the Presidency supports the renewal of the CP, would it be in favour of strengthening it to include, for example, support for the ILO move to bring a case against the SPDC before the International Court of Justice and/or to increase EU financial and political support for civil society groups working in and outside the country? Is the Presidency aware that the current Common Position does not make any mention of the ethnic nationalities, which make up approximately 40% of the population and does not include any reference to EU support for a tripartite dialogue involving the SPDC, the National League for Democracy and the ethnic nationalities, even though both the NLD and the ethnic nationalities have repeatedly stated that this is the only legitimate path for political transformation in Burma? Would the Presidency commit to pushing for the inclusion of an indication of EU support for a tripartite dialogue and a recognition of the key role of ethnic nationalities in the EU Common position?
