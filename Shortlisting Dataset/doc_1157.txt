Question for written answer E-5691/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (22 July 2010) Subject: Use of Member State diplomatic passports by EEAS mission staff All EU Member States routinely issue diplomatic passports to their serving foreign ministry diplomats stationed in Member State embassies in third countries. The Commission has in the past issued EU laissez-passer travel documents to EC (post Lisbon Treaty EU) delegation staff in third countries as the equivalent procedure. When the European External Action Service becomes operational it is envisaged that seconded diplomats from Member State foreign ministries will be serving as temporary agents alongside EU (Commission and Council Secretariat) institution staff in EU delegations internationally. This could mean some staff coming from foreign ministries being issued with national diplomatic passports and other equal ranking staff being denied such official documentation and having to rely on the EU laissez-passer, which is not universally recognised by all third countries and does not necessarily carry the same status, privileges, immunities or courtesies attached to a full national diplomatic passport. 1. Does the Council have any proposals to request all EU Member States to issue diplomatic passports to all their citizens serving in EU delegations or missions abroad on an equal basis irrespective of provenance, in order to prevent a two tier/class system developing of EU EEAS diplomats within the EEAS staff posted internationally? 2. Alternatively, all EEAS staff could be issued solely with the EU laissez-passer and all countries who maintain relations with the EU could be obliged to recognise its status as fully equivalent to that of a national diplomatic passport. Has the Council given this matter any thought?
