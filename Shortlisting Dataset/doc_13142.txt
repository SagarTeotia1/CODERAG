WRITTEN QUESTION E-0307/06 by Eija-Riitta Korhola (PPE‑DE) to the Council (1 February 2006) Subject: Religious freedom in Sri Lanka On Christmas day, a mob of around 30 people attacked members of the King’s Revival Church in Alawwa, Kurunegala District, west central Sri Lanka. During the attack the mob attempted to prevent them from attending the service and threatened the pastor. It has been reported that many fled in fear but that those who continued on their way to church were beaten up. The incident was reported twice to the local police on 25 December and 28 December, but no action was taken until 29 December when the police eventually arrested some people for questioning. Does the Council regularly raise religious freedom with the Sri Lankan authorities, particularly in light of the increasing number of acts of violence targeting Christians? How has the Council encouraged the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure that offenders are brought to court?
