Reply (28 July 2008) The Council would like to point out that decisions to grant arms export licences fall within the national competence of Member States. Compliance by individual countries with the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports can only be subject to a political assessment by the Council. The question of the arms deal which has been signed between Slovakia and Sri Lanka has been raised in the relevant Council body. Member States reiterated that exchanges of views on issues such as this constitute a vital tool enabling further convergence of arms export policies and the harmonised application of the criteria of the Code of Conduct for which they all strive. The Council is considering making the Code legally binding on all Member States by updating and revising it in the form of a Council common position in accordance with Article 15 of the Treaty on the European Union.
