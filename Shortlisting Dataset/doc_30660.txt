WRITTEN QUESTION E-4615/09 by Kriton Arsenis (S-D) to the Commission (29 September 2009) Subject: Pollution of the river Struma The river Struma, one of the most important rivers in northern Greece, has its source in Bulgaria and flows through the prefecture of Serres and then into the sea at the Struma gulf. A serious problem has been observed with the quality of its water, which is systematically polluted by pesticide residues and by agricultural, stockbreeding and manufacturing activities, and chiefly by the uncontrolled disposal of urban waste water and sewage from towns and villages in the region. The result is pollution not only of the river but also of the groundwater in the regions of Pethelinos, Strymonikos and Nigritas. 1. Is the Commission aware of the environmental problem in this region? 2. Is it aware that biological treatment facilities in the region, which received EU funding in recent years, are not functioning? Does it have any statistics showing an improvement in water quality? 3. In this case is Greece infringing the provisions of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste water treatment, the framework Directive 2000/60/EC on water and Directive 80/68/EEC on protection of groundwater? 4. What stage has been reached in transposing the framework Directive 2000/60/EC on water in Bulgaria? 5. Is the Commission aware of the existence of cross-border cooperation programmes between Greece and Bulgaria with regard to setting up a unified scheme for the management of this river basin?
