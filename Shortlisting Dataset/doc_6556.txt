The proposals will mean that in future standardised, safer, more efficient and stackable equipment will enable easier transfer of freight from one mode of transport to another. The directive also aims to harmonise aspects of newly built ILUs through the definition of standards by the European Committee for Standardisation. Another goal is greater security for new intermodal loading units through requirements on use of alarms (for instance electronic seals) to counter break-ins. Parliament also welcomed proposals for the creation of European Intermodal Loading Units (EILUs): units optimised for the transport of goods on pallets, which is the most frequently used packing method. EILUs will combine the advantages of swap bodies (their larger seize, offering a greater capacity) and containers (their greater strength and that they are stackable). The new loading units will make transhipments between road, rail, waterways and short sea shipping considerably more simple, thus promoting intermodality in the transport sector. Parliament also adopted 17 technical amendments proposed by the Transport Committee.
