Answer given by Mr Monti on behalf of the Commission (17 November 2004) Since adoption of the revised Leniency Notice in 2002, the Commission received 92 immunity applications and applications for reduction of fines which so far led to over 38 conditional immunity decisions. As to the distinction between the different types of applications, it should be noted that only one application for full immunity can be granted for each cartel. Apart from that several applications are usually received in the same case, sometimes competing ones. While many of these applications lead to inspections as they provide the first evidence of a cartel infringement, the Commission has also received applications on the occasion of inspections launched on the Commission’s own initiative. In these cases, the application – if successful – enables the Commission to determine the exact scope of a cartel infringement (for example its geographic scope, where previous information related only to cartel activities in a particular Member state). The Commission has received applications both from companies situated in large and small Member states: Italy 7, Greece 2, Germany 23, The Netherlands 9, France 6, Belgium 3, Spain 1, United Kingdom 4, Sweden 2 and Finland 13. As for non-EU applicants, there are 12 cases in which United States companies have made applications concerning their own cartel involvement or as a parent company potentially liable for the infringement of a European subsidiary. Furthermore 2 applications were received from Norway and 3 from Japan (5 applications did not show a clear link with a particular country).
