the early cooperation with the Commission on PP/PAs in the 2006 procedure and expects that this will be reflected in the results and implementation figures at the end of the year. 19. The purpose of this document is not to discuss PP/PAs for 2007 but, for consistency, the rapporteur considers it important to point out that from 2007 the Commission proposes not to continue practically any actions in terms of commitments. All through the PDB 2007 only payments to liquidate previous commitments are maintained. All projects with payments would thus "live on" but only until these are implemented against previous commitments. Then, any actions - if still relevant - would have to be carried out/covered under the new generation of legal bases. Pilot Project on upper secondary pupil's individual mobility (15 02 02 06) 20. The EUR 2,5 million approved for this pilot in 2006 will be used to finance an open call for tender to prepare the individual pupil mobility scheme under the new generation Life Long Learning programme (Comenius sub-programme). The rapporteur has been briefed by the Commission as to the time-table and final orientation of the project and there has been good cooperation from the Commission's side. Following the call for tender and evaluation, the financing decision and signature is foreseen to take place in September/ October 2006. The first payments should take place in late 2006 and continue over 2007. The final payment should be made in 2008. Three interim reports are planned in 2007 and the final evaluation in the first part of 2008. 21. The action has been mainly focussed to deal with a number of difficulties facing student exchanges, such as analysis of legal issues related to the mobility of minors, recognition of study periods abroad and the creation of minimum requirements for training and support for teachers, host families and mentors. The project also aims to create real exchanges between schools for the academic year 2007-2008 in a test phase, with a view to incorporate fully these actions in the new Comenius programme from 2008-2009. 22. The Commission expects to implement fully the commitments in 2006 but does not at this stage foresee any need for additional commitment appropriations in 2007. Consequently only a p.m. is proposed for 2007. The rapporteur will investigate this issue further before the first reading. Pilot project on security along the trans-European road network (06 07 02) 23. An initial cost-benefit report with recommendations was finalised by external consultants in the spring of 2006 and its results were used to formulate the terms-of-reference for a call for proposals. This call was launched in June 2006 with a deadline of mid-August. The Commission is currently evaluating the proposals which are expected to lead to about three final contracts. 24. A global financing decision has been taken for the full amount available (EUR 5,5 million) and, once the evaluation is completed, final discussions on the approved proposals will take place with contracts expected to be signed by the end of the year. The project(s) as such should therefore be implemented as
