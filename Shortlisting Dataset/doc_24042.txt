WRITTEN QUESTION E-0210/07 by John Bowis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (31 January 2007) Subject: Revision of the Medical Devices Directive The demarcation between medical devices directives and medicinal products directives continues to be complex and challenging. What consideration has the Commission given to updating guidance to clarify aspects of the directives on medical devices to seek to ensure the uniform applications of relevant directive provisions? What would the timeframe be for this and will there be an opportunity for wider public consultation on the final draft of such guidelines prior to publication? If so, which groups would the Commission expect to consult?
