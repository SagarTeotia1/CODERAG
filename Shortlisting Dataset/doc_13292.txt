Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (30 April 2009) The Commission is aware of the content of the ‘Decision on the merits’ of 3 June 2008, taken by the European Committee of Social Rights (ECSR) of the Council of Europe, following the complaint lodged by the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (IFHR). The IFHR alleged that Ireland discriminates against persons who are in receipt of Irish Contributory Old Age Pension and who do not reside permanently in Ireland, in that it refuses to allow them access to a Free Travel scheme when they return to Ireland in visit. The ECSR stated that the difference of treatment between residents and non-residents cannot be deemed discrimination within the meaning of the Charter or its Article E and that the Free Travel scheme does not fall within the material scope of Article 12§4 of the said Charter. In addition, the two relevant Assessments of the Committee on 3 June 2008 do not make any reference to an interpretation of Community law. As underlined in its previous answers E‑0727/07 EN, E‑2765/06 available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp the Commission is concerned that the extension of such a scheme to all Irish pensionners, irrespective of their place of fiscal residence, could lead to a discrimination based on nationality in violation of the EC Treaty, consequently it is, in any event, essential that the scheme is applied in Ireland to all holders of Irish contibutory pensions, regardless of their nationality.
