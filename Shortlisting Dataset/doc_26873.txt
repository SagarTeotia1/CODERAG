from the City of Strasbourg and SCI Erasme, it cannot be ruled out that the additional payments might also total at least EUR 46 m (internal audit) or just under EUR 60 m (external audit); – not until March 2006 were there indications that its rental payments to the City of Strasbourg exceeded the latter’s repayments to the private investor; until then, Parliament wrongly assumed that its rental payments to the City of Strasbourg were passed on in full to SCI Erasme when, in fact, this was not the case; – throughout this long period of time, the Parliament’s Administration never questioned whether the rent payments constituted “fair rent” and never verified whether its lease payments were being passed on in full to the SCI Erasme but nor was it ever informed about this matter by the City of Strasbourg itself; – only the City of Strasbourg knew of the existence of two different contractual relationships between the three parties involved and only the City of Strasbourg had been aware of the difference between the two amounts since 1981; – Parliament’s Administration was notified by letter of 29 November 2005 by the City of Strasbourg that negotiations with the private investor had not been ended; at that point, at the latest, Parliament’s Administration should have realised that there had been negotiations between the City of Strasbourg and the private investor; – the rent Parliament pays for its official premises should cover the cost of construction, upkeep and use, but should not in any way contain a profit margin for the host country or local or regional authorities in that country; equally, it is also customary that any public land made available by a host Member State for the purpose of hosting an EU institution is granted to the said institution free and unencumbered; it has to be conceded, however, that none of this was contractually laid down; because of the good relationship with the City of Strasbourg as a supposedly non-profit-seeking public body; ; besides, there are no legal provisions prohibiting a state or local or regional authority from making a profit; takes the view, however, that the City of Strasbourg's approach is discourteous, to say the very least, since it is contrary to rules on hospitality towards international institutions; – the City of Strasbourg was aware of Parliament's consistent exclusion of compensation clauses in property contracts, yet deliberately ignored it ; that has dealt a blow to the relationship of trust between Strasbourg and the Parliament; – deplores the City of Strasbourg's withdrawal from tripartite negotiations with the Parliament, in the course of which it had been reiterated that compensation for loss of the long lease between the city of Strasbourg and SCI Erasme was excluded; this position was then ignored in the City of Strasbourg's subsequent bilateral negotiations with SCI Erasme; 20. Draws the following conclusions from what has been experienced: – Deeply regrets the lack of good faith demonstrated by both the City of Strasbourg and the private investor, SCI Erasme in their relationship with Parliament; equally regrets the
