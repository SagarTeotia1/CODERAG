Reply (2 June 2010) Regarding the first question, the Council is not in a position to give any reply as the Council has no relevant data at its disposal. As to the second question, the Council has not taken any specific measures against these criminal phenomena in professional football. Nevertheless, the Council has adopted EU legislation to deal with these crime phenomena in general, in particular Council Framework Decision 2001/500/JHA of 26 June 2001 on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime OJ L 182, 5.7.2001, p. 1. and Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings OJ L 203, 1.8.2002, p. 1. . On the specific issue of corruption, the Council has adopted on 23 July 2003 the framework Decision 2003/568/JHA on combating corruption in the private sector OJ L 192, 31.7.2003, p. 54. . This framework Decision obliges Member States to ensure that corruption in the private sector, including the football sector, constitutes a criminal offence. Law enforcement action against money laundering, illegal betting, doping and match fixing and enforced prostitution is the responsibility of the competent Member State authorities.
