Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (17 March 2011) The Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007‑13) does not support to date any specific research project focusing on the pathology of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). There is also no specific research project directly addressing the effects of the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) on human health and its potential impact on the development of the CFS. In this context, it should be noted that following a request for scientific advice by the Commission about the XMRV in November 2009, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concluded in November 2009 that there was no clear evidence of a causal link between this virus and any human disease. Nevertheless, the ECDC will monitor scientific evidence on this virus and its link to human diseases. CFS pathophysiology and origins, including the hypothesis of a viral (XMRV) origin, could benefit from knowledge generated by research projects supported under several areas of the FP7 Health theme. Among those, the areas ‘Brain and brain-related diseases’ and ‘Other chronic diseases’ , are the most relevant. In this context, a specific topic on ‘Understanding the role of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases (HEALTH.2011.2.2.1-2)’ has been published in the 5th Call for Proposals of the Health theme and is currently under evaluation. Although focusing on the effects of neuroinflammation on neurodegeneration, some of the projects to be supported under this topic (following a positive peer-review evaluation) may generate knowledge relevant for research on CFS pathophysiology. Decisions on national research funding programmes are a matter for the competent Member States authorities. The Honourable Member is advised therefore to address the Spanish Ministry of Health directly for further information on this question.
