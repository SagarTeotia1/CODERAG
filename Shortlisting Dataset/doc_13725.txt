Question for written answer P-9626/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (15 November 2010) Subject: Istanbul, European Capital of Culture 2010 In November 2007 Istanbul was declared European Capital of Culture 2010. I should like to draw the attention of the Commission to the following points. Turkey has maintained a military occupation of Northern Cyprus, which forms part of the territory of the European Union, since 1974. In the course of the thirty years and more in which it has occupied this part of Cyprus, Turkey has looted and destroyed 532 churches, totally destroying frescoes and dispersing all the churches' sacred Christian icons, ornaments and vestments. According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the destruction of property forming part of the cultural heritage constitutes a war crime. The European Union itself has issued a series of directives on cultural property; countries which are candidates for accession must comply with these directives if they wish to become members of the EU. In view of the foregoing, why did the Union decide to recognise Istanbul as a European Capital of Culture?
