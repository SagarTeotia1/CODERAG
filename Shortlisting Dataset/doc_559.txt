2004/C 70 E/138 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2754/03 by Samuli Pohjamo (ELDR) to the Commission (15 September 2003) Subject: The possibility for Commission translators to work in their home countries It has been put to me that Commission translators could be given more flexible opportunities than at present to work from their home countries. Given modern technology, this would be perfectly possible. Some Commission translators — both officials and those on contract — feel that compulsory posting to Brussels detracts from their quality of life. Aspects which are perceived as particularly problematic are the cost of housing and personal difficulties in acclimatising to life in the big city. It may also be observed that if translators worked in their home countries, this would cost the Commission less. More permanent residence in the home country would also perform an important role in helping translators to keep in touch with their own culture and thus in maintaining their professional skills. Could translators be offered more flexible working conditions by making it the norm for them to work from their home countries?
