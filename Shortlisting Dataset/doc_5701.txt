Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (8 April 2002) The Commission has not been informed on this matter. Treatment, including the therapeutic communities, falls within the competence of Member States and is not covered by the Community Action Program on Drugs and Drug Dependencies. The programme covers mainly prevention programmes, but it has covered treatment, when there has been a preventive element involved. Many Community programmes not dealing explicitly on drugs are also relevant in this field (Equal, Urban, Integra etc.) and may finance drug related actions. The administration of these funds is handled by the Member States. Itaca (Ithaci) is a European Association of Professionals working in the field of drugs. Its main office is in Italy, but Greece is one of the participating Member States. Itaca has received grants from the Community Action Programme on Drugs and Drug Dependencies in recent years. Decisions on subsidies for this year have not yet been taken as not all the procedures are yet complete.
