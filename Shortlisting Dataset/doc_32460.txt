Question for written answer P-007692/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Laima Liucija Andrikienė (PPE) (3 August 2011) Subject: On the implementation of the European arrest warrant in Austria: M. Golovatov case On 14 July, the Austrian authorities arrested and detained Mikhail Golovatov acting upon the European arrest warrant (EAW) issued by Lithuanian prosecutors in October 2010. Mr Golovatov is a former commander of the KGB's Alpha Group, which was behind the killing of 14 people and injured more than a thousand unarmed civilians during the events of January 1991 in Vilnius, when Soviet forces attempted to change the political course of the already independent Republic of Lithuania. The Austrian authorities, however, released Mr Golovatov less than 24 hours after his arrest. What is the Commission's position on this issue? In the Commission's view, has Austria honoured its international commitments to other EU Member States and specifically to Lithuania in this case? By releasing Mr Golovatov, did Austria implement properly and fully the rules and procedures of the EAW? What measures is the Commission going to take in order to make sure that — in the spirit of the fundamental European values of solidarity and justice — when an EU Member State issues an EAW seeking war criminals or persons who have committed serious crimes against humanity (as is the case of Mr Golovatov), or when the extradition of such persons is requested, the persons in question are immediately arrested upon their arrival in the territory of any EU Member State, thereby achieving justice?
