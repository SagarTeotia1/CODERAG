WRITTEN QUESTION E-4108/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (6 August 2007) Subject: UK Government proposal to extend the periods for which people can be detained under terrorism legislation What is the Commission's view of the UK Government's proposal to extend the period for which people can be detained under terrorism legislation by the police to 56 days? Does the Commission agree that the UK Government's proposal to lock people up for 56 days without charge or trial amounts to internment and is an assault on human rights and freedoms? Worldwide research over the years has also shown that prolonged pre-charge detention creates a climate for abusive practices that can result in detainees making involuntary statements, including forced confessions and therefore undermines confidence in the judicial system. Does the Commission agree that reintroducing internment today by further extending pre-charge detention is likely to have a similar effect as it had in Northern Ireland in the 1970s where internment had devastating consequences for those affected and a disastrous impact on human rights protection, the rule of law and society as a whole? Does the Commission agree that it will further alienate affected communities, notably the Muslim community, leading people to mistrust the authorities and make them less likely to want to cooperate with the police? Will the Commission recommend to the UK Government to see sense and retract this regressive and counterproductive proposal?
