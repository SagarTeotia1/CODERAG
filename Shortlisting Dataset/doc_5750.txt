WRITTEN QUESTION E-5489/06 by Glenis Willmott (PSE) to the Commission (14 December 2006) Subject: Responsibility of EU petroleum companies Following recent concerns raised by one of my constituents I would like to formally ask the Commission what action it is taking to ensure that petroleum companies acting in the European Union behave responsibly in third countries where they obtain and initially process crude oil. Will the Commission agree that in order for the EU to effectively spread its values and democratic beliefs to third countries, it is important that its private sector companies act, and are seen to be acting, morally and transparently?
