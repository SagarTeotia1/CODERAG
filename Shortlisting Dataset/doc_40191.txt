WRITTEN QUESTION P-0571/10 by Luigi de Magistris (ALDE) to the Commission (4 February 2010) Subject: Clashes in Rosarno: enforcement of Community law on the exploitation of non-EU workers and the fight against organised crime On 7, 8 and 9 January 2010, the town of Rosarno (Calabria, Italy) was the scene of violent unrest between immigrants (seasonal farm workers) and segments of the local population. According to press reports, two immigrants were wounded by firearms, while others were beaten with sticks and stones; in total, 37 people were injured. 250 immigrants were subsequently deported to other parts of the national territory. The revolt was sparked by the inhuman conditions in which the immigrants had to work and, more specifically, the fact that a couple of them had previously been injured by local gangsters, who procure workers on the black market to work in the fields. The immigrants in Rosarno, as in many other parts of southern Italy, are victims of exploitation, racism and violence and live in desperate conditions. The events of Rosarno would appear to underline yet again the ineffectiveness of national and European migratory policies and of the Italian Government's fight against organised crime, not to mention the still widespread and unacceptable exploitation of immigrant workers and rampant racism. The EU has specific legislation on such matters, namely Directive 2009/52/EC OJ L 168, 30.6.2009, p. 24. of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 providing for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals; Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA OJ L 300, 11.11.2008, p. 42. of 24 October 2008 on the fight against organised crime; Directive 2000/43/EC OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22. of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, and Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA OJ L 328, 6.12.2008, p 55. of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law. What measures does the Commission intend to take in order to strengthen legal migration policies in the EU and the protection of legal and illegal migrants from exploitation and racism, and to step up the fight against organised crime? In its view, how has Italy implemented Community legislation?
