Question for written answer E-001071/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Claude Moraes (S&D) (16 February 2011) Subject: EU ban on the export of lethal injection drugs The EU is a death-penalty-free zone. The European Charter of Fundamental Rights clearly states that the Union firmly rejects the death penalty, and our bilateral agreements prohibit extradition to third countries where the death penalty is imposed. Nevertheless, recent media reports claim that a UK-based company supplied the State of Arizona with lethal injection drugs needed for the execution of a convicted murderer. Is the Council aware of this case involving the export of lethal injection drugs? Given that one of the EU’s basic principles is that no country may be a member if it practises capital punishment, does the Council intend to act quickly to introduce a ban on the export of these lethal drugs from Europe and to reaffirm the EU’s rejection of any support for the death penalty?
