Question for written answer P-5447/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Proinsias De Rossa (S&D) (8 July 2010) Subject: Reform of the Kimberly process diamond certification scheme Parliament's resolution of 23 September 2008 on the ‘Follow-up to the Monterrey Conference of 2002 on Financing for Development’ ( P6_TA(2008)0420 ) stated, in paragraph 36, that while the Kimberley process was moving in the right direction, much more needed to be done to encourage the transparent management of [the diamond industry] and its revenues. Parliament's resolution of 18 December 2008 on ‘Development perspectives for peace-building and nation building in post-conflict situations’ ( P6_TA(2008)0639 ) recognised, in paragraph 48, the achievements of the Kimberley process, but called for it to be strengthened and more effectively implemented and enforced. In an article published in Le Temps (Switzerland) on 18 March 2010, the Geneva Committee of Human Rights Watch claims that there are three main weaknesses in the Kimberley process. First, its charter refers to conflict diamonds only with regard to their use by rebel groups to finance wars against legitimate governments. The Geneva Committee recommended that the definition be expanded so that the process explicitly condemns human rights abuses connected with diamond production, regardless of whether they are committed by governments or rebel armies. Second, there is little independent monitoring of compliance with Kimberley process rules and few penalties for violations. Third, the Kimberley process makes decisions by consensus rather than by voting, which means that it is difficult to take action against a member that violates the rules if just one other member votes to block that action. 1. Does the Commission agree with this assessment? 2. What action is the Commission taking to reform the Kimberley process?
