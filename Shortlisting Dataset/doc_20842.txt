Question for written answer E-008004/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (13 September 2011) Subject: Blue bonds In an interview with the Kathimerini newspaper, the Bruegel think tank economist Zsolt Darvas said that the best solution in order to tackle the speculative attacks that are now spreading to Italy and Spain was to issue euro bonds. The think tank supports the idea of blue bonds that could cover debt up to a certain percentage of a country's GNP and that would be jointly guaranteed by all members of the eurozone, at a very low rate of interest. There are two strands to this proposal: blue bonds and red debt. In the case of blue bonds, EU Member States would have to keep national debt within the upper limit of 60 % of their GNP, which would reduce the cost of borrowing for part of their debt. Red debt, on the other hand, would categorise all public debt over and above the country's blue bonds, i.e. more recent national debt contracted according to the correct pre-selection procedures, thus increasing the marginal cost of public borrowing and helping to strengthen financial discipline. What is the Commission's view of blue bonds in the light of the recommendations made by the Bruegel think tank?
