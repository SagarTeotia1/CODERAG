Answer given by Mr Figel’ on behalf of the Commission (2 May 2006) On July 14, 2004 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Decision of the Parliament and of the Council creating the ‘Youth in action’ COM(2004)471 final. programme for the period 2007‑13. This programme is to specifically facilitate the continuity of measures taken within the ‘Youth programme 2000‑06’, the results of which have been highlighted in an interim evaluation COM(2004)158 final. . Further to the political agreement approved in the trialogue on 4 April, 2006, the Commission is to modify its proposal for the ‘Youth in action’ programme. It will take into account the amendments voted by Parliament as well as the financial backing which will result from the interinstitutional agreement. It should be noted that the Parliament’s support of the ‘Youth in action’ programme will make it possible to retain the ambitious approach of the Commission’s original proposal. This will allow the Council and the Parliament to pursue their legislative work and adopt this new programme in the coming months.
