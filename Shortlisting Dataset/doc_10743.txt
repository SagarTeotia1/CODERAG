Question for written answer E-3609/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jean-Luc Bennahmias (ALDE) (25 May 2010) Subject: Use of social security numbers as a means of identification for the European citizens' initiative In Annex III, box 3.6 of its proposal for a regulation on the citizens’ initiative (2010/0074 (COD)) the Commission enables signatories to use their social security number as a means of identification as an alternative to their passport or identity card number. Furthermore, Article 15 of the proposed regulation states that the Commission may amend the annexes thereto by means of delegated acts. An individual’s social security number is important because it is not attributed at random and can be ascertained from civil status certificates. The CNIL (Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés), the French independent body responsible for issues relating to the processing of personal data, has stated on several occasions that, notwithstanding exceptions, social security numbers should be only used for social security matters. The CNIL believes wider use of social security numbers would allow connections to be made between personal files, which are becoming ever larger, thereby eventually making it possible to trace individuals via their everyday actions. Does the Commission consider such use of social security numbers to be compatible with Article 12 of the aforementioned proposal, concerning protection of personal data and referring back to Directive 95/46/EC OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. , which stipulates that personal data must be ‘adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed’ (Article 6(1)(c))?
