Reply (9 March 2006) At its session on 10 December 2004, the Council reached a partial political agreement on the amended Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation (EU-OPS). This partial agreement related to the articles, as well as to subpart ‘O’ (cabin crew) and subpart ‘Q’ (flight time limitation) of Annex III; regarding the latter subpart, the Council took due note of the opinion adopted by the European Parliament at first reading. In June 2005, the Council bodies reached agreement on the rest of Annex III, comprising subparts A to N as well as subparts P, R and S. The text was then submitted for translation, and subsequently for revision by the lawyer-linguists of the Council and of the European Parliament. In view of the substantial volume of the text (around 400 pages) and its technical nature, this work took a considerable time. However, the work is now almost completed, and the Council will shortly be able formally to adopt its common position. It is intended that this common position be presented to the European Parliament during the first semester of 2006, so as to allow the European Parliament to deliver its second-reading opinion.
