WRITTEN QUESTION E-2173/09 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Council (31 March 2009) Subject: MV Dignity being rammed by the Israeli Navy A Gibraltar-registered cargo vessel the MV Dignity carrying aid towards Gaza was rammed by an Israeli Coastguard cutter on 30 December 2008 at about 05.30 hours EMT, 53 miles off the coast. The vessel left Larnaca, Cyprus, at 7pm on the evening of 29 December. I understand at 4.55 am on 30 December it was 70 miles off the Israeli coast when those aboard saw searchlights at the stern. These searchlights hovered around the vessel for 30 minutes. Israeli vessels fired flares into the air, but failed to reply to radio calls by the Dignity’s master. The searchlights were turned off and shortly afterwards the Dignity was rammed, splintering and suffering severe damage to the bow, and began taking on water. Luckily the vessel did not sink. The Ship’s master immediately put out a mayday call but received no immediate response. When the Israelis did respond they stated that those aboard the vessel were terrorists and that they would shoot at the Dignity . They demanded the Dignity return to Larnaca, but the vessel did not have enough fuel aboard. The Dignity eventually received assistance from the Lebanese Navy and was guided into port in the Lebanon. The incident would appear be contrary to established international conventions whereby authorities should not hinder the supply of vital humanitarian aid. Does the Council share my deep concern and outrage over this incident involving a vessel registered within the EU? Will the Council express this concern to the Israeli authorities, especially as this ship was carrying aid to a war zone, and such actions endangered the lives of all those aboard?
