to forward its position to the Council and Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Swiss Confederation. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Switzerland is one of the major European countries, which has no membership arrangement with the European Environment Agency in spite of the useful information and knowledge it has concerning the Alps. Switzerland made a formal application to join the Agency in 1999, the negotiation process for membership was concluded in June 2004. The proposed Council decisions would put into effect Swiss membership of both the EEA and EIONET. The Agreement makes it possible for Switzerland to fully take part in EEA's work programme. It grants conditions for participation, similar to those governing participation for the current non-EU Member States of the EEA (Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway), as well as those, which were negotiated for the participation of the candidate countries. The Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period. The EEA will treat Switzerland as a Member State, through equal treatment in terms of provisions of environmental data and information and analysis, staffing provisions, contracts to third parties and appointments of and participation in Topic Centres. Switzerland will have to establish an infrastructure for providing uniform environmental data and information on the state of the environment in its territory, it will contribute financially to the Agency budget to cover the cost of its participation, and it will have the right to participate in the Management Board of the Agency without the right to vote. The benefits of the Agreement are several: the provision of reliable and comparable information on the state of the environment in Europe will be facilitated and extended, furthermore, it will also support integrated assessment and environmental reporting of the ecosystems that are shared by Switzerland and its neighbouring countries.
