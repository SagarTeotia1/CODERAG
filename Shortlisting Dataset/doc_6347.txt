ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0019/04 pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure by Joost Lagendijk , on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group to the Commission Subject: Achieving the correct implementation of the EC-Israel Association Agreement On 10 May 2001 the Commission described ‘exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under preferential treatment’ as ‘violations’ of the EC-Israel trade agreements . In the Declaration of the European Union delivered at the Association Council EU-Israel of 17-18 November 2003, the EU stressed ‘the importance of solving the bilateral issue of rules of origin before the origin protocol is amended’. Since that Association Council took place, the Commission has reportedly carried out an exchange of views with Israel regarding possible solutions. Will the Commission accept a solution that does not require Israel to discontinue issuing proofs of origin to settlement products under the EC-Israel Association Agreement? Should the Commission consider it appropriate to recommend or adopt measures to be taken in agreement with Israel concerning ‘the bilateral issue of rules of origin’, is the Commission prepared to consult the European Parliament prior to taking any steps to amend any part of the existing Agreement, including its origin protocol? Commissioner Patten in a speech to the European Parliamentary Plenary 16 May 2001 quoting the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 12 May 1998 (SEC(1998)0695/final)
