Question for written answer E-011146/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Franz Obermayr (NI) (13 January 2011) Subject: Islamic religious books In Great Britain there are an estimated 40 Saudi Arabian Islamic schools with some 5 000 pupils. A BBC report has shown that some of the things taught in those schools are not compatible with European Union values. For example, in radical sharia teaching, warnings are being given of a Jewish international conspiracy, and Jews are described as looking like swine. An Islamic textbook recommends that hands should be cut off as a punishment for theft — and, in the case of recurrent theft, it recommends that feet should also be cut off. In order not to endanger the life of the person being punished, schoolchildren aged between six and 18 learn that, after the hand has been cut off at the wrist, the wound must be cauterised in order to stop the bleeding and prevent infection. In contrast, however, homosexuality is punishable by death by stoning. There have also been similar cases in Austria, where Islamic textbooks have shown pictures of a martyr's death and Islamic religious teachers in Austrian schools have placed religion above the Austrian constitution and fundamental rights. 1. Is the Commission aware of this and similar cases? 2. Does the Commission intend to take measures in connection with radical Islamic religious teaching (in school and outside school)? 3. If so, what measures does the Commission plan to take? If not, why not? 4. Does the Commission take the view that European values such as democracy or fundamental rights are compatible with sharia? 5. How does the Commission view the wish of more than 50 % of Turkish immigrants in Austria that sharia should be introduced into the Austrian judicial system? 6. Has the question of the incorporation of sharia into European case law and European values been the subject of accession negotiations with Turkey? 7. If so, in what way?
