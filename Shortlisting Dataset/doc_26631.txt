WRITTEN QUESTION E-5977/07 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (3 December 2007) Subject: Prisons and the police service responsible for their operation The precarious situation of Italy's penal institutions appears to be deteriorating by the year, apparently for a variety of reasons ranging from the rise in low-level crime (due in part to unsatisfactory immigration policies), to the slow rate at which prisons are built (the average time taken to build a prison is 20 years, and even then the completed prison is generally not up to standard), to the failure to reform (or to reform effectively) the laws which result in people being detained unnecessarily. This critical situation makes it difficult for the police assigned to criminal investigation tasks to carry out their duties. Would the Commission state: 1. What initiatives have been, or are being, taken at European level, in line with the priorities laid down by the European Council in Tampere in October 1999, with regard to communications, training and information for police officers carrying out criminal investigation functions? 2. Is the Commission aware of the existence of unsatisfactory prison systems in European Union countries?
