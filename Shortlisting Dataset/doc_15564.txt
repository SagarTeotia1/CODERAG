budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007 ( C6-0299/2006 - 2006/2018(BUD) ) Section III – Commission Draftswoman: Helga Trüpel SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Culture and Education calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Recalls the importance of promoting active EU policies in the field of culture, education, training, youth, intercultural dialogue and diversity, active citizenship and civil society networks, aimed at creating a political identity for the Union that is more understandable to its citizens and based on political delivery; 2. Points out that the European Union should be closer to its citizens; emphasises that only the appropriate financial resources will make it possible to have an effective communication and information policy, involving citizens in a more active way; considers that reducing the budgetary amounts allocated to the communication policy would send a very negative signal to European citizens; 3. Confirms that the revised structure and functioning of the new-generation 2007-2013 programmes represents an important opportunity to improve both their management and their user-friendliness vis-à-vis all beneficiaries; recalls that this is particularly relevant for instruments which concern mainly small-scale projects; 4.

Regrets that the financial ambitions for the Lifelong Learning Programme have been reduced; notes that the Lifelong Learning Programme will nevertheless be a strengthened instrument for promoting cooperation and mobility for education and training; stresses that European investment in education and training is crucial, not only for effectively implementing the Lisbon strategy and increasing the competitiveness of the European economy, but also for reasserting the civic and cultural value of education and lifelong learning; 7. Reasserts its belief in the importance of the Culture Programme in supporting cultural events and organisations in a sector which is at the core of the European identity, society and economy; underlines the need to make the Youth in Action Programme known to a greater number of Europeans, and recalls that the amount proposed by the PDB for this programme is an absolute minimum; 8. Notes that support for civic participation, town twinning, organisations promoting the idea of Europe and memorials to the victims of totalitarian
