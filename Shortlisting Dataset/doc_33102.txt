2004/C 782 E/351 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3874/03 by Francesco Fiori (PPE-DE) to the Commission (16 December 2003) Subject: Imports into the EU of uncertified active pharmaceutical ingredients Imports from outside the EU (mostly from India, China and other emerging Asian nations) of active ingredients which have not received inspection certificates from any European authority are threatening to cause lasting damage to Italy's producers of active ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry. The products concerned enter the EU accompanied only by paper documentation (the Certificate of Suitability or COS) stating that they conform to the contents of the European Pharmacopeia. This is not a sufficient health guarantee. Italy's producers of active ingredients for the global pharmaceutical industry enjoy a reputation for excellence, thanks to the quality and reliability of their products, which are guaranteed by following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in line with the European guidelines ( GMP Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ), and to the fact that the products have been inspected either by the American Food and Drug Administration or by the Italian health ministry. Given the above, what action will the Commission take with a view to protecting the health of the European public from imports of active ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry produced by companies from the above-named countries? Does the Commission not consider that the Community's principles imply the need for harmonised rules placing all producers under the same conditions of competitiveness and reliability in the Community context, with safeguards against international competition based on product quality, especially in the case of products relating to human health? Does the Commission not consider it necessary to propose and implement at European level a Community regulation to deal with this entire problem and ensure, through inspections of imports, suitable guarantees and standards of precautionary protection for substances and pharmaceuticals consumed within the Union?
