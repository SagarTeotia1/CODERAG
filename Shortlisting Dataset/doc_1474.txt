WRITTEN QUESTION P-2610/04 by Yannick Vaugrenard (PSE) to the Commission (18 October 2004) Subject: European guarantee scheme to support a strong shipbuilding industry in Europe The guidelines for the shipbuilding industry laid down by the Commission under the LeaderSHIP 2015 initiative appear to be a good example of a European policy relating to an industry sector. Those of us in favour of a strong shipbuilding industry in Europe are very keen to see the recommendations set out under LeaderSHIP 2015 applied. One of the recommendations concerns a European guarantee scheme. With this in mind, the Council of Ministers of 26 to 27 November 2003 asked the Commission to consider, in consultation with the shipbuilding industry, whether a European institution such as the European Investment Bank, for example, could play a key role in the ‘pre-’ and ‘post-delivery’ financing of shipbuilding projects. Can the Commission indicate its position on this matter?
