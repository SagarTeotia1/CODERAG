Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (9 August 2010) On 3 March 2010 in its communication on Europe 2020 http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/pdf/COMPLET%20EN%20BARROSO%20%20%20007%20-%20Europe%202020%20-%20EN%20version.pdf the Commission proposed a comprehensive reform strategy for reorienting policies away from crisis management towards the introduction of medium- to longer-term reforms that promote growth and employment while ensuring the sustainability of public finances. The importance of combining fiscal consolidation with strong structural reforms for a successful exit from the crisis can hardly be overstated. A number of EU Member States need to re-establish confidence in the sustainability of their public finances by returning debt levels to a declining path. Besides fiscal consolidation, this requires finding new sources of growth through structural reforms. In this context, the Commission has proposed seven flagship initiatives in areas where joining efforts at EU and Member States level can help achieve best results. In parallel, the Commission has been working with Member States to identify specific bottlenecks to growth at national level and reforms that could deliver growth and confidence effects already in the short- and medium term. These should be reflected in Member States' reform priorities which will form the basis of their National Reforms Programmes for the years ahead.
