WRITTEN QUESTION E-3804/07 by Michl Ebner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (25 July 2007) Subject: International Environmental Criminal Court The proposal to set up, by 2009, an International Environmental Criminal Court emerged last November at the meeting ‘Health, Environment, Justice’ held in Venice by the International Academy of Environmental Sciences (IAES). This videoconference, which concluded with the signing of the Charter of Venice, an IAES document inspired by the EU's environmental policy which aims to secure the recognition of intentional environmental disasters as crimes against humanity and to set up an International Environmental Criminal Court, included the participation of personalities, experts and citizens from all over the world, linked up via the Internet, as well as the presence of ministers and high representatives of institutions and organisations which have been working for years on environmental issues, such as Unesco, the WHO, the EU and Greenpeace. The event was sponsored by the Commission and enjoyed the patronage of the Presidency of the Italian Republic. It was supported by the local institutions (the Veneto region and the Venice city council) and by leading figures from the Italian state bodies. There was also significant participation from the academic world — from the University of Nova Gorica, the Venice University Institute of Architecture (IUAV), and the University of Urbino. After the conference, the site www.iaes.info enjoyed record levels of traffic, with over 110000 visitors from all continents in a short space of time. What measures will the Commission take to secure the recognition of intentional environmental disasters as crimes against humanity and the creation for that purpose of an international criminal court, competent to judge criminal forms of conduct such as those that have already resulted in the Bhopal and Chernobyl disasters?
