Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2010) The Commission was not aware of the closing down of the Valença walk-in clinic, nor of the fact that this limits access for emergency health services to the Portuguese local citizens. The Commission, however, cannot interfere with the decision of the Portuguese Government to open or close hospitals or clinics. This is due to the fact that Member States are responsible for the definition of their health policy and the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care to their citizens. The Commission does support Member States in their efforts to find sustainable means to ensure that patients have access to quality and safe healthcare close to their home, to the largest possible extent. This is why the Commission is committed to creating the legal means to ensure that patients who need or who wish to go to another Member State for treatment are informed of their rights before leaving, have access to quality healthcare and are reimbursed afterwards. To clarify patients' rights in cross-border healthcare, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare in July 2008 COM(2008)414 final. . Following Parliament openion in 2009, the proposal is currently being discussed with the Member States in the Council. Once adopted by the Council and Parliament, this directive will facilitate the exercise of patients' right to be reimbursed for healthcare in another Member State as rules on reimbursements, procedural guarantees and information for patients will become clearer. This will ensure an informed and safer access to cross-border healthcare.
