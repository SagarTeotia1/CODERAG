WRITTEN QUESTION E-1396/06 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (5 April 2006) Subject: Composition of expert groups and committees appointed by the Commission The Commission recently created a high-level group on competitiveness, energy and the environment. Although the Commission itself declares that the choice of members of expert groups must be in line with legal, social and environmental perspectives, it did not apply this view when appointing this group. For example, only 2 of the 26 members of the board are women. Among the members, there is not a single representative from the areas of renewable energy or consumer protection. When appointing this high-level group, the Commission showed no sign of transparency or of having democratic representation. 1. In Decision 2000/407/EC OJ L 154, 27.6.2000, p. 34 . , the Commission committed itself to gender balance within the committees and expert groups established by it. Why does the Commission not put the aim of achieving a gender balance of 40 % women into practice? How does it intend to do this in the future? 2. Can the Commission give an overview of the gender representation in the expert groups and committees created by it since the decision in 2000? When exactly will the Commission provide the long overdue report on the implementation of Decision 2000/407/EC? 3. Besides gender-balanced representation, what criteria does the Commission apply in its decisions in order to ensure gender balance in expert groups and committees? Does the Commission not also see a need for improvement as regards transparency in the selection of the committees and expert groups it creates for specific areas? 4. How will the Commission ensure that the working procedures of the high-level expert groups are as transparent as possible and that its mandate does not go beyond advisory tasks?
