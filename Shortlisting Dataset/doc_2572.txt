ORAL QUESTION H-0097/04 for Question Time at the part-session in March I 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Brian Crowley to the Commission Subject: Adoption of an International Arms Trade Treaty by 2006 In October 2003, Amnesty International, Oxfam and IANSA, (International Action Network on Small Arms) came together to launch the ‘Control Arms Campaign’ in over 50 countries in order to try to stop the rising toll of deaths and suffering caused by armed violence. Will the Commission support the efforts of these organisations to ensure adequate control of the arms trade, and will it actively support the adoption of an International Arms Trade Treaty by 2006?
