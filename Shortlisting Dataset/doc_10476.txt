Question for written answer E-004873/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kriton Arsenis (S&D) (18 May 2011) Subject: Mercosur trade agreement In May 2010, the Commission decided to relaunch the bi-regional negotiations with the Mercosur countries on a trade agreement. Since then, four rounds of negotiations have been completed, and a fifth meeting is scheduled for the beginning of May 2011. Many of the issues being negotiated by the two sides are directly linked with environmental and climate change issues. For example, market measures for meat products have a direct link with land conversion and deforestation — something already recognised by the Agreement's Sustainability Impact Assessment financed by the Commission (Contract No Trade 05-G3-01), which clearly states that an extra 55 million hectares would need to be brought into productive use as result of the agreement, and intense, illegal deforestation will occur particularly in the Mato Grosso area, Brazil. 1. Does the Commission’s main negotiating body, i.e. the Directorate-General for Trade, have the appropriate knowledge to assess and negotiate on the environmental aspects of the agreement? Is there a specialised unit within DG Trade which deals with climate change, environmental and biodiversity issues? If so, does it participate in the negotiations with Mercosur? 2. Are the Directorate-General for Environment and the Directorate-General for Climate Action participating in the negotiations with the Mercosur countries?
