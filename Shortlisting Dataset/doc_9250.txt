life span is shorter. In any event, the life span consumers can reasonably expect must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Batteries and incandescent light bulbs are examples of products which typically have a shorter life span than two years. Finally, Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices OJ L.149/22, 11.6.2005. prohibits misleading practices which are likely to affect consumers' purchase decision, such as false or deceiving information on the main characteristics of the product and on the results to be expected from its use. Exaggerated information on the power of compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs might therefore be considered misleading by the national authorities responsible for the enforcement of the directive.
