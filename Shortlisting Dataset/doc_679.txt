Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (21 November 2011) TEN‑T funding is based on Regulation (EC) No 680/2007 of 20 June 2007 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks OJ L 162, 22.6.2007, p. 1-10. . The rules for pre-financing, interim payments and the payment of the balance as well as the indicative timetable for the commitment of the individual instalments are laid down in this decision. Annual budget commitments and corresponding pre-financings are based on progress of the projects reported by the beneficiary on yearly basis. These yearly reports and the ‘2007-2013 MAP Project Portfolio Review’ are the basis to work with the beneficiaries. The next annual report has to be delivered by March 2012 covering the 2011 developments. For more details on ‘2007-2013 MAP Project Portfolio Review’ consult http://tentea.ec.europa.eu/en/ten-t_projects/mid-term_review/2007-2013_map_project_portfolio_review.htm. The decisions 2007-DE‑17200-P and 2007-DE‑17010-P covering Stuttgart-Wendlingen-Ulm are binding decisions for both partners: European Commission and Federal Ministry of transport (BMVBS) as beneficiary. Every change of a project as such would need a change or a cancellation of the decisions. The bulk of activities were planned for 2011-2013 thus only few measures already materialised and were reported by the beneficiary. In the light of the yearly reporting 2011 and with regards to the result of the referendum of 27 November 2011 possible consequences have to be discussed with the beneficiary. The development along PP17 is in general very good in France and Austria. Several important sections in Austria will be finished by 2012. In both countries most of the works along PP17 are going to be finished by 2016/2017. In Germany most sections are delayed (i.e. Stuttgart-Wendlingen by one year, Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing by two years) or are even partly going to be cancelled (Kehl-Appenweier). Along other sections — not co-funded by TEN‑T budget — also delays are reported by regional authorities (i.e. ‘ Rastatter Tunnel’, Ulm-Augsburg).
