WRITTEN QUESTION E-2105/07 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (19 April 2007) Subject: Community funding to encourage the use of hazelnut, almond and walnut oil Changes to Community legislation regulating the market in dried fruits have resulted in major changes across the board for those EU citizens that make their living by producing dried fruit. Producers have acted in various ways to try to overcome the difficulties resulting from the shift in Community policy on dried fruit — i.e. the scrapping of subsidies. A noteworthy example is that farmers in the sector have decided to produce almond, walnut and hazelnut oil with a view to increasing the market value and using up the substantial stocks that had built up following a decrease in use arising from price rises caused by the end of Community subsidies. However, most members of the public are unaware that hazelnut, almond and walnut oils are being produced, and nor are they aware of when they can be used or of the health benefits of using them. Does the Commission take the view that, in order to help dried fruit producers overcome the effects of the changes to Community legislation, it should provide funding for an information and publicity drive aimed at the general public, outlining the health benefits of using hazelnut, almond and walnut oils, as it did so well for olive oil, the campaign for which was such a resounding success?
