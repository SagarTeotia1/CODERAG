Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (9 July 2010) As stated in its answer to Written Question E-2846/10 by Mr Bennahmias http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , the Commission is preparing a Communication on sport to be adopted during the course of 2010, on the basis of the new provisions of Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the field of sport. In order to prepare future proposals for incentive measures in the field of sport, the Commission is currently implementing preparatory actions in this area. In 2010 a call for proposals has been launched to finance projects in the areas of social inclusion, doping and volunteering which will be carried out during 2011 and 2012. Further preparatory actions have been proposed in the 2011 draft budget. The Commission recognises the great potential of the Olympic Games and of the Olympic ideal to contribute in a positive way to the values of the European Union, including the respect for human dignity, equality and respect for human rights. In discussions with the EU office of the European Olympic Committees and other stakeholders, such as the Greater London Authority, awareness has been raised about possible synergies between EU policies and programmes and the 2012 London Games. Decisions related to the organisation of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games are the responsibility of the London 2012 Organising Committee, the Olympic Delivery Authority and the International Olympic Committee. When planning future initiatives in the field of sport the Commission takes due regard of the principles of subsidiarity and the autonomy of the European sport movement.
