WRITTEN QUESTION E-1219/08 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (5 March 2008) Subject: Infringement of European law by the M‑501 road scheme (Madrid, Spain) My Question E‑1392/06 of April 2006 drew attention to the major environmental damage which could arise from the work on doubling the width of the M‑501 in one of the most ecologically and environmentally valuable areas of the Community of Madrid and Ávila, namely a registered SCI containing various SPBAs. After the building work was well underway, the Commission opened infringement proceedings against Spain for failure to comply with Community law, and has now demanded that the Madrid Community implement corrective measures, including carrying out an environmental impact assessment, which Esperanza Aguirre's government ignored at the outset. Given the Commission's decision to bring the case before the EC Court of Justice, the Madrid Community's government recently agreed to carry out an EIA, but is seeking, under cover thereof, to extend the work on the M‑501 to the border with the province of Ávila, as is revealed by what was published in the Madrid Community Official Journal and the Official Journal of the European Communities of 4 February 2008, in which the project is described as ‘Environmental Impact Assessment, doubling of M‑501, section M40 to the boundary of the Community of Madrid’. On 15 February, the Madrid Supreme Court (TSJM) declared null and void the resolution adopted in 2005 by the Government of the Madrid Community enabling the work to start, since the Madrid Community had not held the requisite prior consultations with the Commission. The Madrid Community's government had not done so because the only environmental impact assessment of the project, dating from April 1998, had been negative, and would have prevented the scheme from being implemented. The TSJM also affirmed that there were no considerations of public interest which justified the implementation of the project. In the light of the foregoing: — Is the Commission aware that the Government of the Madrid Community intends to extend the doubling of the M‑501 to the border with the province of Ávila? — Does the Commission not think that it would be appropriate to ask the Court of Justice of the European Communities to apply precautionary measures suspending the building work, so as to prevent the damage caused by the project from becoming irreversible?
