Question for written answer E-001594/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra (PPE) (23 February 2011) Subject: Decision concerning aid for coal mines On 10 December, the Council adopted a decision on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines, making aid to cover current production losses subject to a number of conditions (Article 3). Not least, it is stipulated that the aid must form part of a definitive closure plan and may not be accorded after 31 December 2018. However, coal prices are expected to rise in the coming years as a result of increased demand from third countries. While they are not expected to reach 2008 levels on world markets, many mines currently dependent on aid could once more show a profit. If this is so and given that Council Decision 2010/787/EU allows absolutely no flexibility regarding deadlines for the cessation of aid and closure of the mines: 1. What measures does the Commission intend to take in response to this fresh possibility of substantially higher coal prices? 2. Does the Commission not consider that the mines in question should be allowed to continue operating even if they have been receiving aid for the period 2011 to 2018?
