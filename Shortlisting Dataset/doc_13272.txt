WRITTEN QUESTION E-5763/06 by Johannes Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (9 January 2007) Subject: Financial contribution provided for in the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Guinea According to information provided by the Guinean Association for the Development of Artisanal Fishermen of Guinea, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture has no surveillance vessels with which to monitor compliance with the fishing quotas fixed in the protocol defining for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008 the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Guinea on fishing off the coast of Guinea. Article 4 of the fisheries agreement provides for a financial contribution from the EC of EUR 500 000 in 2004 and EUR 300 000 in 2005 towards the purchase of two surveillance vessels in order to develop the surveillance policy laid down in Article 3 of that Agreement. — Has the EC respected its financial commitments in order to enable the Republic of Guinea to develop its fisheries surveillance policy? — Did the EC pay those two sums (totalling EUR 800 000) in 2004 and 2005, in compliance with Article 4 of the fisheries agreement? — If it did not, why has the EC not honoured its financial commitments? — If it did, has the Government of the Republic of Guinea consulted the European Commission over the choice of vessels? — Has the Government of the Republic of Guinea purchased two surveillance vessels? — If it has, what has happened to those vessels?
