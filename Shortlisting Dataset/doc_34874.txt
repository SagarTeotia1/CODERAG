Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (15 October 2010) The TSE Roadmap 2 which was adopted on 16 July 2010, is a reflection paper providing an outline of possible future changes to EU measures on TSEs while still making food safety and consumer protection the highest priority. Amendments to the TSE rules are, and will continue to be, taken following a stepwise approach supported by a solid scientific basis. In this respect, the scientific advice provided by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will continue to play a crucial role to consider future policy options and will be the basis for any future risk management options. One of the topics is a possible review of the total feed ban provisions. Any possible amendment will focus on the possible re-authorisation of animal proteins from pigs to poultry and vice versa. This means that the prohibition of cannibalism will remain in force. In addition it should be clear that there is no intention to re-authorise the use of ruminant (cattle, sheep or goats) proteins into feed, or an amendment of the feed ban provisions for cattle. It was the recycling of contaminated processed animal proteins from ruminants in the feed for ruminants which led to the BSE epidemic in the 1980-90's.
