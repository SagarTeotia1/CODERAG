this issue in upcoming meetings with national regulatory and supervisory authorities. Industry contingency plans, including specifications and modalities of usage of these chemicals, are subject to their approval. In that regard, the Commission is working on the setting up of a European Marine Monitoring and Data Network (EMODNET) which would become a useful tool in simulating potential consequences of spills, but also in terms of observing and assessing short and long term impacts of actual spills. As far as control systems on platforms are concerned, it should be noted that under EU legislation technical safety systems of a multiple kind are a standard requirement for offshore installations. In light of the accident in the Gulf of Mexico, the adequacy of current standards can be meaningfully assessed once the causes of the incident have been authoritatively established. The Commission's view is that it should aim at applying the highest existing standards throughout Europe.
