WRITTEN QUESTION E-2921/08 by Søren Bo Søndergaard (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (23 May 2008) Subject: Modular trucks In the light of the Danish Government's wish to test modular trucks over a three-year period beginning in the autumn of 2008, will the Commission say where the boundary lies between a limited experiment with modular trucks and a permanent system and to what extent their introduction on a permanent basis is contrary to the commitments already made?
