Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (30 November 2011) The Commission pays close attention to the impacts of its policies in developing countries. This is why the EU has considered the impact of the promotion of biofuels in the deliberations leading to the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) Directive 2009/28/EC, OJ L 140, 5.6.2009. . The Commission will monitor and report on a range of impacts biennially from 2012. As regards the so-called ‘land grabs’, it is an issue that is generally linked to weak governance in the countries concerned and an issue which is much broader than EU biofuel policy. In general, the extent to which land grabbing is linked to biofuels, other production purposes or land speculation needs to be further researched. So far, most EU biofuel consumption has come from EU land — and the main sources of imports have been the United States and Argentina. Less than 0.5 % of EU biofuel consumption comes from the third countries referred to by the Honourable Member. For further information on these issues, the Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its answers to previous written questions, notably E‑006626/2010 by Mr Mölzer, E‑007895/2011 by Mr Chountis, E‑008192/2011 by Mr Obermayr, E‑003830/2011 by Mr Watson, E‑006815/2011 by Mr Ferreira, and E‑010824/2010 by Ms Yannakoudakis http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp .
