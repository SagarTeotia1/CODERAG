Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (12 August 2011) In line with its recent evaluation report COM(2011)225 final. , the Commission believes that data retention is a valuable tool for law enforcement, protection of victims and the criminal justice system. As the evaluation report highlighted, there has been some criticism of the Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC OJ L 105, 13.4.2006. ) relating inter alia to the necessity to regulate this issue at EU level, the evidence provided by the Member States and to the divergent ways in which the directive has been implemented in the Member States. Following the evaluation, the Commission is considering ways of improving the EU data retention framework. The Commission has had consultations with civil society, law enforcement authorities, data protection authorities, the Member States, industry and the judiciary. These consultations have informed the Commission of the various points of view on possible ways forward. The Commission will consider those ways forward as part of an impact assessment preceding a proposal for review. On the basis of this assessment a proposal will be presented in spring 2012. The Commission will ensure that such proposal — as any legislative proposal — fully respects the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental rights. Meanwhile the ongoing reform of the EU data protection system seeks greater harmonisation across Member States, including, clearer rules and less red tape across sectors in order to ensure that the fundamental right to data protection is properly safeguarded. Those Member States which have not yet transposed the Data Retention Directive are required to do so as they, like all other Member Stares, are bound by EU legislation.
