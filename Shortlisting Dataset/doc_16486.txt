the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of this class of weaponry. The Convention will be opened for signature on 3 December 2008, in Oslo. It will enter into force six months after 30 States have deposited their instruments of ratification with the UN Secretary General. The recent use of this type of weapon during the Georgia crisis demonstrates once more the urgent need to establish this Convention.

On 14 November the Commission published a Communication (COM(2007)0707) on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States. The Communication recorded inter alia that: – the information submitted by the Member States on how they were implementing the Recommendation was 'incomplete or difficult to compare'; – there are still large disparities in the way environmental inspections are being carried out by national, regional and local authorities in the EU; – the scope of the Recommendation is inadequate and does not include many important activities, such as Natura 2000, and the control of illegal waste shipments; – inspection plans in many instances have not been implemented and, where they do exist, are often not publicly available. Good and even enforcement of EU environmental law is essential. Anything less disappoints public expectations and undermines the reputation of the EU as an effective guardian of the environment. Can the Commission therefore explain: 1. Why does it wish only to amend the Recommendation and why does it not propose to take up the reference in the Recommendation to the possibility of it submitting a proposal for a directive on environmental inspections? 2. Why has it opted instead for a piecemeal approach, and proposes to attach environmental inspection requirements to existing directives individually –
