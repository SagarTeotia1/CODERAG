Question for written answer E-011016/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Herbert Dorfmann (PPE) (25 November 2011) Subject: Exceptional maintenance work on the Innsbruck-Brenner railway line In view of the fact that exceptional maintenance needs to be carried out on the Innsbruck-Brenner railway line (and is scheduled for 2012), the Austrian infrastructure manager has put forward four work plans. One variant entails complete closure, whereas the other three involve successions of partial closures with the line completely closed down for short periods in between. The manager has decided to partially close the line, with service reduced to single-track running, from June to October 2012 and to close it down completely in the five weeks from 6 September to 10 October 2012. This will have a significant impact on infrastructure as a whole, be it investments for the express purpose of increasing rail traffic (upgrading of railway lines, new intermodal terminals, dry ports, railway undertakings, etc.) or those facilities which will have to cope with an unusual and unforeseen rise in road traffic. The operation of the Brenner railway line is in jeopardy, and the consequences could translate into unsustainable social, environmental, and economic costs. The results achieved in terms of environmental sustainability need to be preserved in order to safeguard and improve the quality of life for the communities established along the Brenner Corridor and to enable a higher volume of rail freight traffic to be carried on that axis. What will the Commission do to avert such extensive disruption to the rail freight traffic flow along the vitally important Corridor No 1 in 2012, bearing in mind the potentially far-reaching implications for the development of rail freight traffic in general?
