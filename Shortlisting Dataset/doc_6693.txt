Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2008) The Commission is aware that the Czech authorities see the completion of the R1 Prague Ring Road as a key objective. The Commission is aware of the two variants (option J and option Ss) highlighted by the Honourable Member, but has not yet received any information from the authorities on the outcome of relevant studies. The Czech authorities have included the Ruzyně-Březiněves section (projects SOKP 518 and 519) in the indicative list of projects in its Operational Programme Transport 2007‑13 for the Czech Republic, but there has to date been no request from the authorities for co-financing. Financial assistance from Community funds would only be granted if the project respects all relevant Community legislation, in particular that on cohesion and TEN‑T policy, environmental protection and public procurement. The Commission may not intervene on the definition of a project's alignment, provided that choices taken by national authorities comply with Community and national legislation, including environmental rules.
