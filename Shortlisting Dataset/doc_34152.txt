Question for written answer E-000913/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) (7 February 2011) Subject: VP/HR — Investigation into organ trafficking in Kosovo On 16 December 2010 the Swiss MP Dick Marty submitted a report to the Council of Europe on trafficking in human organs, whose victims were reportedly some of the prisoners captured by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The report merely confirms accounts published in 2008 by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla del Ponte, and the investigation published in 2009 by two journalists, Michael Montgomery and Vladimir Karaj, into this illegal trafficking in organs and the existence of various secret KLA detention centres in Albania. According to the report, many of the prisoners captured by the KLA were transferred, under the management of the Drenica Group of fighters surrounding Hashim Thaçi, now Prime Minister of Kosovo, and Shaip Muja, leader of the KLA medical brigade and now a health consultant, to a small clinic situated 15 km from Tirana International Airport in Albania where, when a customer appeared for the receipt of organs, they were shot in the head and their organs, usually kidneys, were extracted. All this happened before and during the UN’s international protectorate, and although the foreign collaborators and the beneficiaries of this traffic are unknown, the report indicates the University Hospital in Jerusalem as a possible destination, in view of the unusually large number of kidney transplants that took place there during 2001. Thus in addition to the possible involvement of the present Kosovo Prime Minister, the report and the earlier investigations clearly point to the possible connivance of the European governments that supported the KLA under Thaçi during the war. Bearing in mind that the main aim of EULEX, the EU mission in Kosovo, is to assist the Kosovo institutions in establishing the rule of law, What measures is the High Representative planning to take to ensure that this investigation produces results? How will she deal with the problem of jurisdiction highlighted by Del Ponte? Will the High Representative support the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal or, if not, referral of the case to the International Criminal Court? Will the High Representative be holding the European governments involved in this crime politically responsible for their possible connivance?
