Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (23 May 2011) 1. The Commission had a meeting with the European Federation of the Footwear Industry (EFFI) in January 2011 in which it explained that it will monitor the imports of footwear coming from the People's Republic of China and from Vietnam, for one year following the expiry of the anti-dumping measures at the end of March. The monitoring system has been put in place as of 1 April 2011 on the basis of the customs statistics from the Member States and Eurostat. Furthermore it was agreed that the EFFI will be informed of the results of that monitoring on a monthly basis, and this for the first time at the end of April. If at any point in time the data collected would justify the initiation of a new case, this could be considered. 2. As mentioned in the Commission's recent publication ‘Trade, Growth and World Affairs’ the EU will remain an open economy but we will not be naïve. In particular, the Commission will remain vigilant in defence of European interests and European jobs. It will fight unfair trading practices with all appropriate measures. The EU will closely look at the evolutions in the footwear industry in order to maintain a global market for footwear in which European SMEs can compete on fair terms.
