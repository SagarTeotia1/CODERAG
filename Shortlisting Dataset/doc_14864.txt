WRITTEN QUESTION E-3609/07 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 July 2007) Subject: Persons with disabilities and the new technologies The term ‘support technologies’ covers a broad range of computer services, equipment and applications which facilitate communications and mobility for persons with disabilities. Recent research has shown that persons with disabilities have problems in using their mobile phones properly. Programmes which use technology to facilitate communication for our fellow human beings who suffer from sensory impairments are today essential for the smooth integration of such persons into social life. Will the Commission say which further programmes to support new technologies it intends to implement with a view to helping European citizens with disabilities meet their communications requirements? Does the Commission intend to adopt an appropriate legal framework to guarantee at Community level the social character of the new technologies and ensure their quality?
