is often the case - at the end of the year, so as to enable the budgetary authority to conduct at least a partial assessment of their impact when the following year's budget is being drawn up; 3. Expects the Commission to follow the commitments it has made in the budgetary procedure 2002, in particular the joint declarations concerning the implementation profile for the 2002 budget and concerning the action plan to put an end to abnormal outstanding commitments agreed in the conciliation before second reading between the three institutions; 4. Notes that the date for forwarding the report on implementation profiles agreed to by Parliament in connection with the 2002 budget could not be fitted into Parliament's work schedule, and therefore proposes that the dates laid down by the joint declaration be amended and that programming profiles be broken down in greater detail; 5. Notes that, for December 2002, the Commission is forecasting an average implementation rate of 100% for commitments and 97% for payments; hopes that these are realistic forecasts, in particular as regards payments, given that the implementation rate for them was only 72% in 2001; invites the Commission to submit, by 30 September, the list of lines and chapters where there is a risk of divergence from that profile; 6. Recalls that one of the major objectives of the reform of the Commission aimed to improve the implementation of Community programmes through new methods of management such as deconcentration and decentralisation of the external service, new types of externalisation, significant requests for human resources, and redeployment of staff towards political priorities; therefore expects concrete and visible results; 7.

Reiterates its satisfaction that a solution for the financing of the Convention on the Future of Europe was found (SAB 1/2002) which assures that the Convention can function properly and that the budgetary powers of Parliament are guaranteed; 9. Emphasises that SAB 2/2002 has returned to Member States a preliminary amount of € 10 billion of payment appropriations that were not spent in the previous year; considers this to be an extremely high figure and expects to receive a further analysis, by September 2002, of why these funds could not be implemented under the EU budget in 2001; points out that a less restrictive approach to payments could obviate the need for many transfers, particularly in cases where the Commission finds it difficult to demonstrate that it is unable to use all the appropriations entered; considers it important to receive a quarterly payments schedule from the Commission, before the first reading, for more efficient implementation of payments; 10. Restates its utmost concern over the poor implementation of payment appropriations; considers that it is necessary to improve the track record and image of the EU in this respect, to accelerate payments on old commitments or to decommit those and cancel the payment appropriations; calls on the
