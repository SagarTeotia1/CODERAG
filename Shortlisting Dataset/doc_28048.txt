2004/C 51 E/150 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1752/03 by Eija-Riitta Korhola (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 May 2003) Subject: Use of impact assessment and liability insurance to deal with oil damage Disasters at sea are not just an environmental problem, but also do immense economic harm. Oil damage might, for example, undermine the utility value and by the same token the asset value of seaside property and land. It could impede the operation of industrial plant and power stations situated on the coast. For instance, sea water-cooled nuclear power stations would have to be shut down for a long time, even years, because oil could clog up the cooling systems, leading to serious consequences. The provisions applicable to accidents at nuclear power stations might serve as a model to deal with potential damage. The impact of an oil tanker accident would be assessed to help determine the cumulative probability distribution of costs and other consequences. Secondly, oil liability insurance similar to nuclear liability insurance would be needed to cover the wide-ranging consequences described above. In what ways, over and above existing legislative measures and those being drawn up, does the Commission think that impact assessment and liability insurance, as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, might be useful in gauging and remedying the wider consequences of oil damage?
