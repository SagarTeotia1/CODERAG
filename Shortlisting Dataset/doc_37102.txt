Answer given by Mr Ciolos on behalf of the Commission (7 September 2010) The rules on the calculation of Single Payment System entitlements for land that is considered commonage as requested by the Honourable Member are as follows. For the allocation of the payment entitlements, determination under the single farm payment took place according to the general rules for the single payment scheme in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/200, OJ L 270, 21.10.2003. as described below. After the reference amount was calculated, as provided for in Article 37, the value of entitlements was determined according to Article 43(1): by dividing the reference amount by the three year average number of all hectares which in the reference period gave right to direct payments listed in Annex VI. The number of hectares included all forage area in the reference period. Article 43(3) of the above Regulation defined the forage area as ‘the area of the holding that was available throughout the calendar year, in accordance with Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 of 11 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92, OJ L 327/11, 12.12.2001. , for rearing animals including areas in shared use and areas which were subject to mixed cultivation’. The relevant part of Article 5 reads: ‘where a forage area is used in common, the competent authorities shall notionally allocate it between the individual farmers in proportion to their use or right of use of it’. This shall be used by the Member State with regard to the calculation. However, as the management of the single payment scheme is a matter of national competence, in accordance with the principles of shared management, the Commission does not intervene. Under the arrangements governing the implementation of EU support schemes in the framework of the common agricultural policy, it is for the Member States to take all the measures necessary to satisfy themselves that subsidies are granted correctly and to prevent and deal with irregularities. In the context of the procedures for clearance of account, the Commission follows up on the national implementation of the EU support schemes. The purpose of this monitoring is the protection of the EU funds in the light of which the conformity of the implementation is reviewed against the legal framework.
