in this field of policy, for proper evaluation of measures already adopted; Terrorism and organised crime 41. Believes that the domestic and international fight against terrorism and organised crime - and the structures which sustain them - is critical to building a safer Europe for our citizens, and that the Commission should continue work as a matter of urgency on clearer common definitions of certain serious crimes with a cross-border dimension (notably terrorism, trafficking in drugs and human beings, money laundering, and cyber crime), combined with agreed minimum sentencing rules where appropriate; in this light, welcomes the Commission's plans to bring forward a new initiative on security research; Borders, asylum, immigration and visa policy 42. Welcomes the emphasis on creating a common approach to border control, asylum and immigration, and highlights more specifically the continuing need to strengthen security at the EU's external borders, for more coherent and consistent visa rules, and for effective partnerships with third countries to reduce illegal immigration at its source; 43. Urges the Commission to strengthen the common visa policy and increase the security of travel documents, by including biometric data, overseeing the effective implementation of VIS (Visa Information System), following its adoption by the Council, and accelerating the design and development of SIS II (Schengen Information System); insists, in this context, on the need to legislate at EU level for data protection; 44. Calls, moreover, on national governments to forewarn other Member States before engaging in significant unilateral initiatives on the migration issue; 45. Believes that the launch of the new Action Plan on Drugs will provide an improved framework for combating drug addiction and trafficking within the Union, and expects it to focus on best practice and follow evidence-based approaches; 46. Calls on the Commission to propose a proper EU legal base for Europol, which would strengthen its future role and ensure its effectiveness; stresses the need to reinforce confidence in the justice systems of Member States, based on the principle of mutual recognition, minimum standards and safeguards of rights for all involved; 47. Notes the initiative to transform the EUMC into a European Agency of Fundamental Rights, but is concerned at potential duplication with other human rights organisations; Transport safety 48. Welcomes the Commission's policy objectives in the transport sector, with the strong emphasis on improved safety in maritime, air and road transport in general, and on security in respect of Trans-European Transport Networks in particular; in particular, the third package on maritime security should improve this aspect; 49. Calls on the Commission carefully to check, in the mid-term review, whether the objectives of the White Paper are being attained or whether adjustments need to be made; Health and disaster prevention 50. Urges the Commission to ensure that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control becomes fully and effectively operational without any further delay, especially given the threat of communicable diseases, the potential of a pending influenza epidemic and the rapid increase in multi-drug resistant diseases, especially AIDS and tuberculosis; 51. Stresses that citizens must be afforded adequate protection by reducing the risk
