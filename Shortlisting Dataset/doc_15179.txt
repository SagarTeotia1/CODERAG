Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (23 April 2009) In October 2008 the Commission approved the state aid for IKB AG subject to certain obligations and conditions IP/08/1557. . Under the EC aid rules, obligations and conditions may need to be imposed in order to prevent competition from being distorted to a disproportionate degree by the granting of state aid. Possible obligations include operational restrictions or compensatory measures, i.e. the requirement to close down or dispose of certain areas of the business. IKB AG was required inter alia to reduce its real estate financing activities significantly. It was in this connection that the transaction referred to by the Honourable Member took place. The aid for ING Bank N.V. had to be approved in accordance with the EU aid rules without the imposition of any compensatory measures and no provision is made for operational restrictions in connection with real estate financing. The direct or indirect acquisition by a competitor that has also received state aid of a business area or of parts of it in line with a condition imposed by the Commission may not be politically desirable. However, in the case at issue, this is unobjectionable from the viewpoint of aid legislation.
