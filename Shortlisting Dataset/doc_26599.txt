WRITTEN QUESTION E-6651/08 by Jas Gawronski (PPE‑DE) and Charles Tannock (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 December 2008) Subject: Extending the Kimberley process for other resources fuelling civil conflict in Africa Resolution P6_TA(2008)0563 of the European Parliament, adopted on 20 November 2008: — calls on the EU Member States to implement the recommendation of the UN Panel of Experts on the illegal exploitation of the DRC's [Democratic Republic of Congo’s] natural resources, including sanctions against those persons and companies whose participation in the pillage has been proven; — calls on the Council and the Commission to insist in talks with the governments of the DRC and neighbouring countries on the implementation of effective systems of traceability and proof of origin of natural resources; — calls for the effective establishment of monitoring mechanisms analogous to the Kimberley process for the certification of the origin of natural resources from the DRC imported into the EU; and — calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that European companies do not trade in, handle or import products derived from minerals that have been sourced in a manner that benefits armed groups in the DRC. What is the Commission’s view regarding the feasibility of such measures to stop DRC’s resources from fuelling further bloodshed? What assessment has the Commission made of the recommendations contained in the resolution? What perspective can the Commission bring to bear on this issue following its chairmanship of the Kimberley process in 2007? How quickly, in the Commission’s view, can such a system be activated? What practical barriers does the Commission foresee that could delay such a system's being introduced?
