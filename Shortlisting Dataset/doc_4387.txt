2004/C 58 E/079 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1368/03 by Joan Vallvé (ELDR) to the Commission (11 April 2003) Subject: Increase in aid for hazelnut producers The production of nuts in certain European Union areas is a typical example of single-crop and multifunctional production. The zone given over to their production provides a guarantee of land conservation and prevention of erosion and also helps to safeguard against the forest fires that are one of the most common dangers in mountainous Mediterranean areas, particularly during the long and in many cases dry summer season. This season is one of high temperatures and, at the same time, an almost total lack of rainfall. It would be very difficult for alternative crops to be grown in the areas where hazelnuts are currently produced. The fact should not be overlooked that some of the areas now given over to hazelnut production were wine-producing areas in the 18th Century, before the phylloxera outbreak which devastated the vineyards of Catalonia in the last decades of that century. A large part of the former vineyards were replanted with hazelnuts. The EU rules currently applicable to vines (Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 OJ L 179, 14.7.1999, p. 1 . ) make any reversion to the pre-phylloxera scenario unviable. Neither would it be possible to envisage replanting these production areas with oil crops, and more specifically olives, given their latitude and climate, and also the current Community rules on olive oil production (Regulation (EC) No 1873/2002 OJ L 284, 22.10.2002, p. 1 . ). Lastly, the introduction of cereal crops, which could substitute for the production of hazelnuts in areas where these were grown on flat land, would not be possible in view of Regulation (EEC) 1766/92 OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21 . . In view of the multifunctional nature of hazelnut production and the difficulty of replacing it with other types of production, does the Commission not consider that a form of aid should be introduced which goes beyond that currently envisaged in the Commission proposal COM(2003) 23 final?
