Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (23 August 2011) The European Union, through the EU Delegation and the embassies of the EU Member States in Kathmandu, has been monitoring the situation of Tibetans in Nepal, and is in close contact with the Tibetan organisations, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the authorities in Nepal. The EU takes the view that Tibetan refugees should be allowed to exercise their right to freedom of association, in conformity with the international human rights norms. This should be done in a way which would permit the smooth implementation of these rights. Access to Nepal’s territory should be maintained, and the Gentlemen’s Agreement, drawn up between the Government of Nepal and the UNHCR, should be honoured. New Tibetan arrivals en route to Kathmandu apprehended by the Nepali authorities should be transferred to UNHCR’s care promptly and without hindrance. There are also approximately 20 000 Tibetan refugees who arrived in Nepal before 1990 and who are allowed to remain in the country. They are, however, unable to obtain citizenship, and their rights in Nepal are limited. The EU considers that improvements are needed in the registration, the issuance of identity documents, and the provision of access to citizenship and civil registers for this group. The EU will continue to raise this issue with the authorities where appropriate, and will continue its monitoring of future developments.
