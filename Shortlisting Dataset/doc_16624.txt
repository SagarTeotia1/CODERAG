not enough commitment has been shown for the implementing of the European Charter for Small Enterprises, which is a matter both for the Member States and the Commission, in cooperation with organisations representing small enterprises; whereas the European Council in Barcelona urged the Member States to speed up implementation of a European Charter for Small Enterprises and to be guided by good practice, Q. whereas, in accordance with the principles of European good governance, policies concerning enterprises should only be planned and implemented after consultations with organisations representing them, 1. Welcomes the Green Paper on entrepreneurship in Europe as a successful starting point for a wide-ranging debate on the policy of the European Union and the Member States on fostering entrepreneurship, as well as the Commission communication on 'Thinking Small in an enlarging Europe' and the Commission report on implementation of the European Charter for small enterprises as a contribution to the more rapid implementation of the Lisbon objectives; criticises, however, the fact that the Green Paper does not pay sufficient attention to the recommendations of the European Charter for Small Enterprises; deplores the fact, finally, that the Green Paper deals almost exclusively with start-ups and high-growth enterprises, to the detriment of enterprises in traditional sectors of activity and cottage industries and family enterprises; 2. Considers that the Commission Green Paper on entrepreneurship in Europe forms part of the Lisbon Process and, as such, suggests avenues to explore and sketches out possible lines of action that can help the Union to achieve its ambition of becoming the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010; 3. Stresses that the Lisbon objectives must remain the leading priority of the Union's economic and social policies, particularly in the run-up to enlargement, and that it is therefore essential for the Member States to ensure that the EU budget contains the resources required to achieve these objectives; 4.

Stresses that the budget headings relating to the Lisbon Process must be properly implemented if the process is to be implemented on schedule; 6. Notes that implementation of these budget headings is, in volume terms, acceptable, with the exception of research policy (36% as at 31 July 2003), against which there is, furthermore, a significant level of outstanding commitments, equivalent to 185% of the budget allocated to the policy; 7. Draws attention nonetheless to the importance which Parliament attaches to very small businesses and the craft trades and regrets that such undertakings are hardly mentioned in the Green Paper, which, furthermore, basically places the emphasis on start-ups or high-growth undertakings to the detriment of traditional sectors or family undertakings; 8. Stresses that very
