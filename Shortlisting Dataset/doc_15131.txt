2004/C 70 E/054 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1601/03 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE) to the Commission (12 May 2003) Subject: Lifting of the temporary restriction on the use of fishmeal in animal feed Annex I to Commission Decision 2001/9/EC OJ L 2, 5.1.2001, p. 32 . concerning control measures required for the implementation of Council Decision 2000/766/EC OJ L 306, 7.12.2000, p. 32 . concerning certain protection measures with regard to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and the feeding of animal protein lays down the conditions under which the Member States may authorise the feeding of fishmeal to animals other than ruminants. Even though the measures taken in Decision 2000/766/EC allow the use of fishmeal in the feeding of pigs, poultry and aquatic species, the measures laid down in Annex I to Decision 2001/9/EC are so restrictive as to render such use virtually impossible. Is the Commission aware of the economic harm which these measures are causing for the European fishoil and fishmeal industry? What steps has the Commission taken or will it take to resolve these problems and mitigate the damage caused? Bearing in mind that the Commission must review the application of these measures by 30 June 2003, their precautionary nature and the fact that they were adopted without any scientific basis, and taking account of the adverse socio-economic impact on the EU industry and the suitability of this raw material for animal feed, does the Commission not consider it appropriate to repeal these measures and lift the consequent temporary ban on the use of fishmeal in animal feed?
