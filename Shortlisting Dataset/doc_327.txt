ORAL QUESTION H-0490/09 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Papanikolaou to the Commission Subject: Language learning programmes for immigrants The amount of time it takes immigrants to adapt and integrate into a society depends to a large extent on learning the language of the country in which they live. Knowledge of the language is an essential tool in the integration of immigrants into work and social life, it helps reduce marginalisation and alienation and can prove beneficial for both immigrants and the host country. Do the Member States have adequate programmes available to enable immigrants to learn the language of their host country? If so, which of those programmes are funded by the EU? What information does the Commission have concerning the implementation of such programmes by Greece? Does the Commission have quantitative data concerning programmes of this type, such as the number of immigrants who have taken advantage of these programmes and their effectiveness? Does it consider that such efforts should be intensified? If so, in what way?
