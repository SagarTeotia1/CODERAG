WRITTEN QUESTION E-3804/05 by Rosa Miguélez Ramos (PSE) to the Commission (21 October 2005) Subject: Serious losses for producers of durum wheat seed in Spain With reference to the answer to Written Questions E‑2782/05 and E‑2783/05, I wish to touch on certain aspects of the issue that remain somewhat unclear. The minutes of the meetings of the Management Committee for Seeds in autumn 2003 show there was an extreme reluctance, on the part both of the Commission representatives and of many Member States, to grant any transitional period since it was maintained that the quality premium should only apply to durum wheat seed that satisfied certain conditions as from that year's sowings. It was with great effort that a transitional period of just two years was secured, as a major and maximum concession. How can it be that it was decided without much ado in 2005, when technically an extension was already impossible, to extend the transitional period by one year, during which the premium would be granted to seed that did not meet the quality requirements, when the initial two-year period was considered more than sufficient, as Spain has shown? Did the Commission inform all the Member States simultaneously that this extension was in the pipeline? Did the Commission at any time check whether or not the Member States had sufficient seed satisfying the quality requirements, or whether some of them had seed of a sufficient quality to cover the needs of those declaring that they did not? The Spanish producers who had to sell off cheaply all the seed they had produced in the autumn of 2004, since they knew nothing of a future extension, suffered losses of over EUR 12 million. When and how are they going to be compensated for this?
