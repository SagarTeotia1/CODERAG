Question for written answer E-4183/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (15 June 2010) Subject: Italian fishing at risk The Mediterranean Regulation (1967/2006 OJ L 409, 30.12.2006, p. 9. ) particularly penalises Italy, a country that has always been synonymous with small-scale fishing, which still accounts for 5 % of its fleet. The Commission laid down new rules for Mediterranean fishing, including a requirement for broader mesh making it impossible to catch young squid or transparent goby, for example, which are very small; it also introduced new minimum distances from the coast: trawl nets must not be used within 1.5 miles of the coast, while the dredges used to catch bivalves — such as donax and razor clams, which live and reproduce a few metres from the coast — must be at least 0.3 miles offshore. The regulation’s restrictive measures clash sharply with our system of production. How does the Commission intend to protect endangered species from highly destructive fishing practices? What economic measures does it intend to take to assist penalised fishermen?
