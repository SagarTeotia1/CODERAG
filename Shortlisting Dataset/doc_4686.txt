WRITTEN QUESTION E-1961/08 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (9 April 2008) Subject: Zero tolerance for ‘rave parties’ During a ‘rave party’ held in Segrate (Milan province) last Saturday, a 17-year-old boy lost his life and many others suffered severe health problems after ingesting synthetic drugs, probably MDMA (methamphetamine). The phenomenon of rave parties, impromptu gatherings at which alcohol and drugs are consumed freely, has become widespread in many EU countries and the dangers to the health of the young people taking part in them are ever greater. Many have already lost their lives and the cause of death has been established as the use of synthetic drugs, which are not always fatal, but undoubtedly cause permanent health damage. 1. Does the Commission not think that the Member States’ authorities should be required to enforce more stringent checks to prevent the holding of such dangerous events? 2. Does it not think that the Member States should draw up effective measures to combat this crisis? 3. Does it not think that a major lack of education lies at the root of this phenomenon and that all institutions, including those at European level, should take measures to involve schools, civil society and the mass media in creating networks to provide support for families and teachers in the difficult task of alerting young people to the dangers of drugs? 4. Does it not think that the European Union should play a more active role in educating young people to respect their own and others’ lives by launching campaigns to combat all types of drug-taking and violence?
