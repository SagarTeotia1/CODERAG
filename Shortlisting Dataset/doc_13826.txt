political parties should remain in the Commission's budget, instead of them being entered in Parliament's section; 14. Takes the view that, following the adjustment of the financial perspective, it should continue to budget up to 20% of heading 5 ("Administrative expenditure"); notes that, besides enlargement preparations, additional cost factors such as buildings and the Members' statute could oblige it to exceed the self-imposed ceiling; Enlargement 15. Is willing to examine the progress made with the necessary preparations to ensure that Parliament is fully operational by the date of accession on the basis of an updated multi-annual report from the Steering Committee on Enlargement; expects its administration and the Bureau, however, to further fine-tune their calculations to prepare for enlargement with a view to providing best value for money; 16. Stresses that it should also, given the challenges posed by enlargement, seize the opportunity to further examine which rationalisation measures could contribute to a more productive use of resources; invites its Bureau, therefore, to take an ambitious stance as regards the activities that could be re-organised or discontinued, as identified by the Steering Committee on Enlargement, taking due account of the Corbett report and the views which the political groups have expressed on this matter; invites its Bureau also to examine which rationalisation measures can be adopted in the management of Members' allowances and expenses and the activities of non-attached Members, before requesting the budgetary authority to make appropriations available for additional posts; 17. Reiterates its commitment to the principles of multilingualism as an integral part of the institution's democratic legitimacy; notes that this enlargement will add up to 10 new languages to the institution's work; considers that the concept of "controlled multilingualism" should be implemented in such as way as both to ensure equality of languages and to make the best possible use of existing human and financial resources through proper planning of requirements in this area; invites its Bureau to further develop this concept in a pragmatic way and invites its political groups to examine what contribution they can make in the context of their activities; also invites its Secretary-General to examine ways to improve the scope for making use of interpreters with a view to their continuing to be as responsive as possible to the institution's needs, even when there are 25 languages; 18. Recalls the decision in principle to create 479 enlargement-related posts in the general secretariat and 110 posts in the political groups; expects the outstanding posts to be created during this budgetary procedure; 19. Takes the view that the posts created for enlargement by the budgetary authority should, in principle, not be used for other non-enlargement purposes; invites its Secretary-General to examine all redeployment possibilities before re-allocating enlargement posts to new specific needs, such as those resulting from the implementation of the new Financial Regulation; insists, however, that particular attention must be given to Parliament's core activity areas in the allocation of enlargement-related posts; 20. Points out that informatics is an important cost factor in Parliament and that enlargement obliges it to modernise and rationalise this domain;
