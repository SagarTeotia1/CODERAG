Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2011) The use of electricity for rail transport is generally considered important because of its technical, economic and environmental benefits. Some rail companies procure their electricity from renewable sources as part of the corporate responsibility programme. Even if there are clear benefits for using electricity including electricity produced from renewable (RES) and combined heat and power (CHP) sources in rail transport, the Commission has no plans at the moment to propose a specific directive on this topic. The Commission considers that the European legislation regarding RES and CHP and the possibilities of the Member States to act taking into account the specific situation of the rail sector in their own country are sufficient in this respect. Furthermore it should be underlined that the CO 2 price which rail transport indirectly pays through its electricity costs is much lower than the tax burden imposed on competing modes, notably road transport.
