p. 2. and Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) OJ L 136, 31.05.1999, p. 1-7. . (10) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1. , hereinafter “the Financial Regulation”, and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 OJ L 357, 31.12.2002, p. 1. , which safeguard the Community’s financial interests, have to be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. (11) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. (12) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. measures for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted, with a distinction being made between those measures which are subject to the management committee procedure and those which are subject to the advisory committee procedure, the advisory committee being in certain cases, with a view to increased efficiency, the more appropriate. (13) The objectives of the programme, namely the support to civil society associations, the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, the protection of Fundamental Rights and the protection of the Rights of the Citizen, through an interfaith and multicultural dialogue cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or impact of the initiative, be better achieved at Community level. The Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives. (14) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers other than those under Article 308. (15) The Economic and Social Committee has delivered an opinion OJ C 69 21.3.2006.
