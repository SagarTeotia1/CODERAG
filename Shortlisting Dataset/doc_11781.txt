Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (11 June 2010) The Honourable Member points to excessive delays in Portugal in evaluating medicinal products intended exclusively for hospital use, in view of their funding by the health insurance system. The Portuguese authorities would not respect the time-limits of 90/180 days provided under Directive 89/105/EEC Directive 89/105/EEC of 21 December 1988 relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion within the scope of national health insurance system, OJ L 40 of 11.2.1989. for issuing pricing and reimbursement decisions. According to a study commissioned by the pharmaceutical industry, it takes the competent authorities more than 500 days to decide on the funding of new medicines for hospital use. To date, the Commission has not received any complaint highlighting repeated or systematic delays with respect to reimbursement decisions for hospital medicines in Portugal. The information available indicates that the time-limits laid down by Directive 89/105/EEC have been adequately transposed into Portuguese legislation. If the Portuguese authorities fail to comply with the obligations of the directive as transposed in national law, the Commission draws attention to the fact that affected parties have the capacity to seek legal redress before the competent national courts. The Commission will, nevertheless, enquire about the situation with the Portuguese authorities and examine potential issues with respect to medicines for hospital use. The Commission also informs the Honourable Member that it has announced a possible review of Directive 89/105/EEC, subject to an impact assessment to be carried out by 2011 http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/planned_ia/roadmaps_2010_en.htm#enterprise .
