Answer given by High Representative/Vice President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (23 July 2010) In a declaration on behalf of the EU of 3 June 2010, the High Representative/Vice President condemned the use of violence that resulted in such a high number of victims, and demanded an immediate, full and impartial inquiry into the events. The EU considers that the continued policy of closure in Gaza is unacceptable and politically counterproductive and has been working strenuously to achieve a durable solution to the situation. The EU continues to call for the immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza. The High Representative/Vice President and the Foreign Ministers of the EU Member States further discussed this issue during the Foreign Affairs Council of 14 June 2010 in which they reaffirmed the readiness of the EU to contribute to the implementation of a mechanism based on the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access that would permit the reconstruction of Gaza and the revival of its economy. To achieve progress on the ground, the High Representative/Vice President will continue to engage, as a matter of urgency, with the Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Quartet members and other appropriate parties and will present EU options with a view to the next Foreign Affairs Council.
