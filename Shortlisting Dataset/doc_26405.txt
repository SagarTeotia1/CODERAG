WRITTEN QUESTION E-1717/06 by Roberto Musacchio (GUE/NGL) and Giulietto Chiesa (ALDE) to the Commission (21 April 2006) Subject: Results of the fourth World Water Forum (Mexico City 16‑22 March 2006) In its final ‘Ministerial Declaration’ the fourth World Water Forum, held in Mexico City from 16 to 22 March 2006 and attended by Commission representatives, refused to recognise access to drinking water as a universal, indivisible and indefeasible human right. This is in clear opposition to the request the European Parliament explicitly addressed to the Forum in its resolution of 16 March this year (adopted virtually unanimously and forwarded to the President of the Forum). The decision constitutes an arrogant lack of respect for the unanimous request formulated by the elected representatives of 25 countries, who represent 450 million people, on the part of a Forum that claims to have international democratic legitimacy solely because its deliberations are concluded by a ‘ministerial conference’. How did the Commission representatives who attended the Forum uphold and defend the requests made by Parliament in the aforementioned resolution? What is the Commission’s reaction to the Forum’s refusal to recognise access to drinking water as a human right? What view does the Commission take of the fact that every Forum is concluded by a ‘Ministerial Declaration’, when the Forum itself is an initiative launched and administered by the World Water Council — a body established under French private law?
