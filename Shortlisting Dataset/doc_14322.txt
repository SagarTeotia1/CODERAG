Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (5 March 2008) In the explanatory memorandum to the Commission legislative proposal of 10 September 2007 to amend Council Directive 80/181/EEC COM(2007)510 final. , it is stated, on the basis of the information that both the United Kingdom and Ireland conveyed to the Commission, that: ‘The exemption of the acre for land registration allowed under Article 1.b however is no longer in use, because of changes in administrative procedures in both Member States’ (point 1.2). The United Kingdom in particular, in its contribution of 5 March 2007 to the public consultation that the Commission had launched in order to identify the issues to be considered for the update of Council Directive 80/181/EEC, noted that: ‘The UK’s three Land Registries no longer use the acre for new title plans or for describing registered properties, although imperial units may sometimes appear in quotations from older property deeds, where these are part of a new register entry’ (point 9.6). On the basis of the above, the current exemption under Article 1b of Council Directive 80/181/EEC with regard to the acre is no longer required and therefore, recital six of the Commission legislative proposal states that ‘since the acre is no longer in use for land registration purposes in the United Kingdom and Ireland there is no longer any need to provide for an exemption in that respect’.
