WRITTEN QUESTION E-1812/08 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (2 April 2008) Subject: Ireland and Shellfish Water Directive On 14 June 2007 in Case C‑148/05, the European Court of Justice found Ireland in breach of Directive 79/923/EEC OJ L 281, 10.11.1979, p. 47. on the Quality of Shellfish Waters by failing, in accordance with Article 4 of the directive to designate all shellfish waters requiring designation; in accordance with Article 3 of the directive to set all the required values in respect of shellfish waters designated or requiring designation pursuant to Article 4; and in accordance with Article 5 to take all necessary measures to establish pollution reduction programmes for waters requiring designation pursuant to Article 4. Has the Commission been formally notified of the plans announced by the Irish authorities on 31 July 2007 which included plans to increase the number of designated waters from 14 to 54? Is the Commission of the view that increasing the number of designated waters to 54 now complies with Ireland's obligations under the directive, particularly the requirement to designate all shellfish waters requiring designation? What action will the Commission take if it concludes that Ireland is still not compliant with its obligations under the directive?
