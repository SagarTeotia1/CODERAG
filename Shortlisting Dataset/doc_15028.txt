Justification This is a necessary consequence of the amendment of Directive 74/408/EEC relating to the interior fittings of motor vehicles (strength of seats, their anchorages and head restraints) EXPLANATORY STATEMENT 1. General framework · The measures proposed by the Commission form part of a package of three proposals, which should be kept together and treated in parallel because modifications in one proposal (for the sake of coherence) have automatic repercussions on the two others. This proposal concerns basically the extension of the categories of vehicles in which safety belts and/or restraint systems have to be fitted in order to get the Community type approval as it is laid down in Council directive 70/156/EEC. The only category where safety belts are mandatory for Community type approval is the category M 1 (= private cars under 3.5 tonnes). The Commission proposes here to include also the categories M 2 (mini-buses with maximum 8 passengers + driver), M 3 (bigger buses and coaches, except city buses) and the N category covering N 1 (light commercial vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes), N 2 (medium commercial vehicles of between 3.5 and 16 tonnes) and N 3 (heavy commercial vehicles over 16 tonnes). · This proposal fits into the broader action programme launched by the Commission and approved by the EP, aimed at bringing down the number of road fatalities as it has been outlined in the White-book for the European Transport policy for 2010 (COM(2001)370). · More specifically, following several serious accidents with buses on the 8 th May 2003 in Hungary (33 victims), on 18 th May 2003 in Lyon (28 victims), the chairman of the EP's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Caveri, tabled a resolution ( B5-0338/2003 ) on behalf of this Committee, asking in its paragraph 6 the Commission to
