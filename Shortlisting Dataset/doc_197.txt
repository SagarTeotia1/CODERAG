WRITTEN QUESTION E-3088/04 by Gay Mitchell (PPE-DE) to the Commission (2 December 2004) Subject: Access to services within the EU An Irish constituent, having recently moved to another EU country, was not permitted to set up a bill-paying mobile phone contract because of insufficient credit rating history in that country. The mobile phone company involved refused to investigate the person's long credit history in Ireland. Will the Commission comment on whether this constitutes a breach of Article 12 of the EC Treaty, which states that any discrimination on the basis of nationality is prohibited? Does the person concerned have any other remedies?
