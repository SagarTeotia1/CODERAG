WRITTEN QUESTION P-0574/08 by Mieczysław Edmund Janowski (UEN) to the Commission (6 February 2008) Subject: Omission by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) of information in Polish about open competitions AD/113/07, AD/108-110-112/07 and AD/114/07 As an MEP, I endeavour to take account, in all my undertakings and public statements, not only of my country of origin but also of the interests of the entire Community. This includes taking account of European diversity, a result of the co-existence in the Union of 27 Member States, the inhabitants of which speak their own language. That being the case, and in view of the numerous questions addressed to me, I would like action to be taken regarding the information given about competitions for posts within the EU institutions. I refer to a particular case. In Official Journal C 279 A of 22 November 2007, the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) published information about Open Competition AD/113/07 (Heads of Unit in the field of translation) and about other competitions (e.g. AD/108-110-112/07 and AD/114/07) in only three official languages — English, French and German — failing to include information in Polish and the other eight languages the competition directly concerned, or in the remaining EU languages. In my opinion, this is a clear failure to observe the requirement to publish information about competitions in all the official languages of the European Union in the aim of enabling people to find employment within the EU civil service. If I am correctly informed, a similar situation arose in the past with regard to three other EPSO competitions — AD/94/07, AST/37/07 and AD/95/07 — that was considered to be discriminatory. In that case, EPSO published additional information about the competitions in the other official languages and extended the deadline for the submission of applications. In order to respect the rules on access to the European civil service and to ensure equality among EU citizens and legal certainty, it is essential to adhere to Council Regulation No 1/58 OJ L 17, 6.10.1958, p. 385. , according to which all languages have equal status (Article 1) and documents of general application — such as information about open competitions — should be published in all official languages of the EU (Article 4). In view of the present situation, can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. How does it explain the failure to provide official information about competitions EPSO/AD/113/07 and AD/114/07 in Polish and other official languages, in particular those directly concerned by the competitions in question? 2. What steps will the Commission take to ensure that this clear oversight is remedied without delay? 3. Does it intend to suspend the competition procedure?
