the Commission to ensure that the Lamfalussy process works effectively at each level; recommends that greater political attention be given to the implementation and application of existing legislation in the financial services field; Corporate governance and contract law 11. Applauds the commitment to improving the business environment as regards entrepreneurship and corporate governance, with the aim of fostering the efficiency and competitiveness of business and of strengthening both the rights of shareholders and the protection of third parties; calls for initiatives to work towards a convergence of civil and commercial law; 12. Stresses the importance of increasing the degree of consistency in the contract law area; calls on the Commission to continue its efforts for greater coherence between the various contract law instruments, inter alia through the adoption of a Common Frame of Reference; asks the Commission fully to associate Parliament in those activities; Research and development 13. Welcomes the high priority given to strengthening the Union's R&D effort, not least through the establishment of a European research council, and the emphasis on the importance of the Seventh Research Framework Programme in contributing to the Lisbon goal of developing a knowledge economy; in this context, urges the Commission to present a proposal providing for concrete support for basic and innovative research - focusing on specific innovations such as hydrogen cells, solar energy, biotechnology, space and cleaner cars - as well doubling financial support (in terms of the ratio to GDP of the EU-25, compared to that for the EU-15 under the sixth programme); Competition policy 14. Believes that a strong competition policy and the effective enforcement of the rules thereof are extremely important in improving competitiveness; urges the Commission, therefore, to ensure that a properly resourced and strong competition policy - one which is independent of the Member States - is maintained in coming years; welcomes the impetus of the Commission in promoting competitive practices in a number of sectors, while initiating a process aimed at increasing private enforcement of EU competition rules, by improving litigation for damages resulting from infringement; 15. Supports the Commission's overall policy aim of ensuring less, better focused state aid, as well as its intention to launch a wider reflection on the future of state-aid policy, but emphasises that there should be no discrimination between Member States in the application of such policy, and that changes due to purely statistical effects should be treated fairly; Stability and Growth Pact 16. Calls on the Commission to ensure that, in order to guarantee sound finances, the essential structure of the Stability and Growth Pact is safeguarded in any proposed reform, in particular the reference to the existing three per cent deficit, and that more attention is paid to the public debt position of Member States and to an improved monitoring of national economic performance and forecasting, whilst foreseeing the possibility of some flexibility for countries with low debt ratios in times of severe recession, provided this encourages good behaviour in times of growth and underpins general structural reform; Cohesion policy 17. Firmly asserts the importance of cohesion policy in
