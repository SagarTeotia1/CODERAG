Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (29 March 2007) The Commission notes that the European Union has imposed sanctions of various types, including the suspension of aid, in response to human rights violations in several countries. In each case, the Commission and Member States take care to ensure that the sanctions are proportionate to the severity of the violations which give rise to them. Moreover, sanctions are tailored to the situation in question so as to be most effective. Even when dealing with authoritarian regimes, continuing to provide financial assistance which either engages mid‑ranking officials in contact with the European Union, or directly or indirectly benefits civil society within the country, may be more effective in promoting medium and long-term change than allowing authoritarian regimes to pursue policies of complete self-isolation.
