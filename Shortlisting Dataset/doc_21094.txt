France before, simple, short and streamlined authorisation procedures are necessary to make adequate progress. Regarding measures at EU level, priority is the timely adoption and implementation of the draft directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources COM(2008)19 final. . Under this proposal Member States would be subject to binding national targets for the share of renewable energy in 2020, and an indicative minimum trajectory in the period up to 2020. Member States would be obliged to prepare national action plans setting out how to reach the targets, and take appropriate steps to do so. Apart from legislation, numerous EU initiatives are taken in the field of renewable energy. Examples include EU support to research, technological development and demonstration, support to projects aimed at overcoming non-technological barriers (within the Intelligent Energy Europe programme) and support to local projects through the cohesion policy or through loans from the European Investment Bank See for example the ‘Practical Guide to EU funding opportunities for Research and Innovation’: http://cordis.europa.eu/eu-funding-guide/home_en.html .
