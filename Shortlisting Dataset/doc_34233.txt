WRITTEN QUESTION E-4017/07 by Gabriele Stauner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (2 August 2007) Subject: Statements by Commission Vice-President Kallas on fraud against the EU budget In an interview published by Welt online on 3 July 2007 (‘Many people see the EU as a greedy animal’) Siim Kallas, the Commission Vice-President with responsibility for anti-fraud measures, stated that in the agricultural sector only ‘some 0.005 % of the budget gets lost’. Vice-President Kallas went on to say that 0.005 % of the budget amounted to EUR 8 million, a comparatively small amount, and that every supermarket chain suffers greater losses as a result of theft than the EU budget. The most recent activity report of the European Anti-Fraud Office, published in mid‑July 2007, shows that OLAF estimates the financial impact of the 53 cases involving agricultural expenditure that it closed in 2006 at more than EUR 53 million. Can the Commission explain the disparity between OLAF's figures and those given by Vice-President Kallas? Can the Commission confirm that OLAF does not itself investigate all suspected cases of fraud involving agricultural expenditure, but often leaves this to the Member States, so that the volume of unjustified payments must in fact be significantly higher? Does the Commission agree with the assessment that, in addition to the established level of fraud, the number of undetected cases is probably relatively high?
