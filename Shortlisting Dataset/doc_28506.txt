WRITTEN QUESTION E-4574/06 by Gyula Hegyi (PSE) to the Commission (26 October 2006) Subject: State aid changes as regards film production in the UK The Finance Act 2006 adopted in the United Kingdom contains important changes to the way films are supported by the UK Government. Accordingly, state aids will no longer be given to British qualifying films under the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production; British qualifying films will be eligible for tax incentives only on expenditure made in England. The European Commission is about to consider this aid as compatible with the common market, however, this clearly endangers the European film industry’s ability to combat American dominance in the European area. Why does the Commission think that the abovementioned state aid measure is justified?
