WRITTEN QUESTION P-4807/05 by Thomas Ulmer (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (14 December 2005) Subject: Boys contaminated by the chemical DEHP A study by the German Federal Environmental Agency has shown that the chemical DEHP, a plasticiser used in the production of plastics, is to a great extent contaminating boys of pre-school age in Germany. Experiments on animals have demonstrated that DEHP affects the development of the testicles at that age. The main source of contamination is considered to be found in the films used to package certain foodstuffs, particularly meat and sausage products and fruit juices. 1. Are there studies regarding the contamination of boys of pre-school age in other European countries? 2. What measures is the European Commission taking to reduce the contamination of foodstuffs by the chemical DEHP?
