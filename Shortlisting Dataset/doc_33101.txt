Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2006) The Commission is aware of the problems encountered by the population belonging to the Greek minority in the islands of Gökçeada (Imvros) and Bozcaada (Tenedos). The Accession partnership adopted in January 2006 sets out the priorities that Turkey should meet in the area of minority rights, cultural rights and the protection of minorities. These include promoting cultural diversity and protection of minorities in accordance with international standards and with best practices in Member States. Furthermore, Turkey should guarantee legal protection of minorities, in particular as regards the enjoyment of property rights. The Commission will continue to follow up closely the above issue and will report on any development in this respect.
