has already substantially reduced its emissions through improved production efficiency; notes, however, that, in the longer run, the emission-reduction potential of agriculture is substantial (by 2050 the agricultural sector will be able to reduce non-CO 2 emissions by between 42 % and 49 % compared to 1990-levels), but could be considered rather limited compared to other sectors; stresses that all the countries that are the main emitters must make an appropriate contribution; notes that greenhouse gas emissions reduction in the agricultural sector is a win-win-win situation as it increases farmers’ long‑term economic and agronomic viability, via increased climate resilience and reduced eutrophication, and lowers the external costs of pollution for society as a whole; 2. Stresses that clear emissions targets will stimulate the early investments needed in R&D, demonstration and deployment of low-emitting technologies and that defining a long-term strategy is paramount to ensuring that the EU is on track to achieve its agreed objective of reducing emissions by 2050; calls on the Commission to propose mid-term emissions reduction objectives for 2030 and 2040 for all relevant sectors, including agriculture; states that these targets should follow a linear trajectory between current emissions levels, the 2020 objective and the 95 % reductions to be made by 2050; 3. Considers that long-term competitiveness can only be achieved by having healthy, biologically diverse agro-ecosystems that are climate resilient and by taking due care of limited and finite natural resources, such as soil, water and land; 4. Notes that emission mitigation efforts are expected to increase the demand for bioenergy; stresses the potential of the agricultural sector to contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy by increasing the production of sustainable energy, through sources such as biogas, and thereby creating new jobs in rural areas; calls, therefore, for greater recognition of the contribution made by agriculture and forestry through the sustainable production of renewable energy, which is currently credited to the energy, transport and heating sectors when taking stock; stresses that biomass and biofuels must be produced sustainably, using robust sustainability criteria, efficiently, and without affecting negatively agrifood markets, land used for production, and food and land prices, avoiding the clearance and conversion of valuable natural ecosystems; 5. Emphasises the importance of new technologies in the development of renewable energies and the production of bioenergy and indicates that the EU should harness every available innovation in order to achieve its objectives for the reduction of CO 2 emissions; 6. Stresses that sustainable use of forests contributes to reducing CO 2 emissions and that it is therefore necessary to take measures under the second agricultural policy pillar to enable forests to be managed even in difficult locations; 7. Recalls that as the world’s arable land decreases, while its population increases, action on climate change and the need to ensure global food security are dual challenges which need to be pursued together; stresses that the need, on the one hand, to expand production and the need, on the other hand, to increase the sequestration of carbon in soil and biomass must not lead to a conflict of goals; 8.
