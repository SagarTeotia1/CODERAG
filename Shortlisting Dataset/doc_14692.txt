Reply (5 May 2006) As stated in the EU‑India joint action plan (11984/05), ‘Both India and the EU are committed to upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms …’. Both sides have committed to ‘continue, in a spirit of equality and mutual respect, the dialogue on Human Rights …’. The promotion and protection of children's rights worldwide are matters of great importance to the Council. The EU actively promotes rights of the child by tabling resolutions on this issue at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. EU Heads of Mission in New Delhi have indeed used their dialogue with India on human rights, most recently on 1 December 2005, to raise questions concerning the ratification of ILO Conventions. The Government of India has acknowledged in the UN framework that ‘for several reasons children of different ages do work in India’, but has argued ‘that it is not practical immediately to prescribe minimum ages for admission to each and every area of employment in India’. The EU will continue to promote progress in this field, including by continuing the dialogue on human rights with India, in particular concerning the ratification of the relevant ILO Conventions and India's domestic legislation.
