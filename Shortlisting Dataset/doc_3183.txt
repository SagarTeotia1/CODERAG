the development of local markets, manufacturing and capacity by supporting local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) so that they can take on responsibility for merchandising new technologies in a particular region; ensure that the fund will be consistent with and supplement other Member State and EU development policies and energy initiatives targeted at developing countries; explore ways of enlarging the fund in the future context of a post-2012 regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The European Parliament regrets the fact that the suggested minimum funding target of €100 million - with a contribution of only €15 million for each of the years 2007 and 2008 - is woefully inadequate as the GEEREF's contribution when the goal is to "boost the share of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. It urges the Commission to increase its contribution while at the same time encouraging Member States, as well as multilateral finance institutions, to join forces in order to significantly increase the size of the fund.

The European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers celebrates its tenth anniversary in 2008. Although a draft Common Position by Council to make this Code of Conduct legally binding has been agreed by COREPER on 30 June, 2005, the Member States have yet to adopt this at a Council meeting. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for this to go forward, and suspects that failure to do so is "evidently linked to the wish of some EU Member States to lift the current EU arms embargo on the People's Republic of China," a change which the EP has repeatedly opposed. The Code of Conduct is a crucial issue in the current context of Commission initiatives to "harmonise national arms procurement policies and intra-Community arms transfers and sales", and with respect to the possibility that the ever-increasing ESDP military and civilian missions of the EU "might be threatened with arms previously supplied by EU Member States."
