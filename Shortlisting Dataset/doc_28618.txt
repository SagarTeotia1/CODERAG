intention to revisit the strategy towards Latin America and to launch a new approach to bilateral relations, and in this context underlines the need to relaunch the concept of a 'Bi-Continental Association' framework for relations between the two continents; 68. Believes that, unless and until there is a significant improvement in the human rights situation in China, it would be wrong for the EU to envisage any lifting of its embargo on arms sales to China, imposed in 1989; requests that the Commission formally oppose such a move when it is discussed in the Council; Regional issues 69. Urges the Commission and Member States to capitalise on the opportunity for peace in the Middle East provided by the ceasefire declaration at Sharm el Sheikh, and to provide, in the framework of the Quartet, a clear and balanced input into the process of finding a lasting peace between Israel and a viable, democratic Palestinian state - able to live side by side in peace and security in the framework of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, as set out in the Roadmap; 70.

Calls on EU institutions to take the lead in swiftly implementing the UN Millennium Project's report, 'Investing in Development: a Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals'; 75. Welcomes the commitment to multilateralism in general and to the United Nations in particular, but cautions against allowing the slow pace of international cooperation to dictate the speed of our own initiatives to combat global warming, poverty and disease; International action on environment and sustainable development 76.
