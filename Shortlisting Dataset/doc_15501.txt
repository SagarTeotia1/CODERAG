that the EUR 619 million appropriation foreseen in the PDB contains administrative as well as operational expenditure. As regards operational expenditure in Title 18, according to the Commission's PDB, this totals EUR 571,3 million. This implies EUR 47,7 million for administrative expenditure. Unfortunately, this does not correspond to line 18 01 entitled "administrative expenditure of area of freedom, security and justice policy area" for which EUR 51,47 million is requested. 5. The Commission presents the following split between the different actions (general programmes, other actions and programmes, decentralised agencies) in PDB 2007: Table 1 PDB 2007 Framework Programme /Other Programme /Agencies EUR % Fundamental rights and justice 71 510 000 12,5% Solidarity and management of migration flows 291 300 000 51,0% Security and safeguarding liberties 57 490 000 10,1% Other actions and programmes 78 400 000 13,7% Decentralised agencies 72 639 000 12,7% Total 571 339 000 100,0% Source: European Commission But is not clear if these two figures can be compared at all as Budget 2007 will see the launch of three new framework programmes: "Fundamental Rights and Justice", "Solidarity and Management of Migration flows" and "Security and Safeguarding Liberties" Reports SEGELSTRÖM ( COM(2005)0122 ), KUDRYCKA ( COM(2005)0123 ), LA RUSSA ( COM(2005)0124 ); The opinion of the Budget committee were drafted by Neena Gill, Kathelijne Buitenweg, Louis Grech, Simon Busuttil, Gerard Deprez, Yannick Vaugrenard, Ville Itälä .

Publications such as the World Migration Report Available via http://www.iom.int/en/news/prwmr2005%5Fpresskit%5Fen.shtml produced every two years by the International Organisation for Migration highlight monitor the major developments in migration trends. The most recent 2005 report highlights that the estimated 175 million international migrants represent around 2.9 percent of the global population. In the current European debate, the situation regarding migrants is a particularly important topic in Spain, where attention has focused on movements of people from the continent of Africa. 7. The APS resolution (paragraph 22): "stresses that the objective of the integration of migrants and border management is of importance in the years to come; intends to provide sufficient means in 2007 to ensure that the extension of the Schengen area is flanked by the principle of Community solidarity in the management of the Union's external borders". 8.
