Question for written answer E-006240/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Juozas Imbrasas (EFD) (27 June 2011) Subject: Standardisation of direct payments across the European Union EU direct payments are needed in order to offset the negative impact of market price volatility on farmers’ profitability and to stabilise their earnings, while at the same time providing food security and enabling those who work the land to be competitive throughout the Union. Although the level of direct payments in the new Member States is officially supposed to reach 100 % of that in the old Member States in 2013, the differences, in per-hectare terms, will remain considerable. Reference to historical indices of agricultural production in the new Member States has resulted in disproportionately low payments there because, over a period in the past, farms were not rationalised and their profitability fell short of the index levels in the old Member States. These factors hinder the new Member States in becoming properly integrated because the single market does not offer a level playing field, and the fact that the starting points were different in the new and old Member States results in differences of economic performance. Given that it is increasingly uncertain whether the CAP will be reformed after 2013 and direct payments, which make up about 70 % of the overall support allocated from the CAP annually, will be made in accordance with new principles, can the Commission state whether additional monies will be made available so that the new targets can be reached and whether, if the CAP continues to be financed from the EU budget, those currently receiving the most funding will lose out?
