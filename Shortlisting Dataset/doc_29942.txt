Question for written answer E-009961/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (7 November 2011) Subject: Proposal on the European Social Fund The Commission has published a legislative proposal on the European Social Fund, which marks a significant step forward in incorporating social goals into the European Union's budget. The European Social Fund is targeted at those in the greatest need. One of the Fund's four priorities is to combat social exclusion and poverty, with 20 % of appropriations — around EUR 16 800 000 000 — going towards this goal. The legislative proposal mentions ‘marginalised communities’ and victims of social exclusion. It also identifies specific target groups, such as the Roma and the disabled, alongside other disadvantaged groups. How does the Commission intend to ensure that European Social Fund projects are implemented successfully and that they genuinely help those in the greatest need? How will it ensure that the Council's deliberations on the multiannual financial framework do not threaten the reallocation of 25 % of cohesion funding?
