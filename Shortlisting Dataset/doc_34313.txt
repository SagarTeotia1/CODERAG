Question for written answer E-8989/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Berlato (PPE) (28 October 2010) Subject: European Central Bank's fears over renewed tension on financial markets According to data published in the European Central Bank's October Bulletin, the prospects for the sixteen euro economies are risky and ‘concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets’. In the text, consisting of a hundred or so pages, the ECB does not mention the gradual withdrawal of the emergency measures adopted during the recent economic and financial crisis, merely stating that the ‘non-standard measures’ are ‘temporary in nature’ and that ‘the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely.’ It adds that for many euro area countries the 2011 budgets ‘need to reflect the commitment to ambitious fiscal consolidation.’ Given the above information, does the Commission share the ECB's concerns over the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets? Following the crisis, the ECB had urged euro economies to undertake to adopt ‘credible multi-year consolidation plans’ with ‘immediate […] and convincing corrective action’. Does the Commission, albeit while respecting the various competences, share this strategic vision?
