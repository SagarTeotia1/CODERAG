WRITTEN QUESTION E-4228/06 by Antolín Sánchez Presedo (PSE) to the Council (10 October 2006) Subject: Commitment on immigration The growing impact on the European Union of the global phenomenon of immigration calls for common policies to be drafted and developed in the countries of origin, entry, transit and destination. According to the statistics published by the Commission on the implementation of the 2005 budget, the EU left 80 % of the budget for immigration (EUR 62.4 million) unspent. The non-use of the earmarked funds, in spite of the extent of the problem, the existence of crisis areas and the high level of implementation of the Community budget as a whole (99.2 %), was put down to coordination problems among the Member States and the fragmented nature of the various programmes in this area, which makes it difficult to use funds effectively. This situation certainly comes as a surprise considering that it is sometimes claimed that there are insufficient resources to meet the challenge posed by immigration. Does the Council consider the shortfall in budgetary implementation to be compatible with the European Union's commitment on immigration? Can the Council indicate how the problems of lack of coordination among Member States and the fragmented nature of programmes will be addressed? What other measures will be taken to deal effectively with this challenge in future?
