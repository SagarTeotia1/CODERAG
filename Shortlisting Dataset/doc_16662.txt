Question for written answer E-005054/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Santiago Fisas Ayxela (PPE) (23 May 2011) Subject: Nationality clauses On 6 September 2010, a complaint (CHAP (2010) 02781 Italy) was lodged with the Commission condemning the particularly strict ‘nationality clauses’ laid down in the rules of the Italian Swimming Federation governing water polo competitions. Such clauses represent a serious breach of workers' rights to freedom of movement and the freedom to provide services guaranteed by the treaties. They are also clearly at odds with the Bosman case law. What action is the Commission intending to take with regard to Community law?
