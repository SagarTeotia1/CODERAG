WRITTEN QUESTION E-5503/08 by Ioannis Kasoulides (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 October 2008) Subject: Consultancies for pension and sickness funds and other funds of general interest During the debate on the financial crisis in the European Parliament's plenary sitting of 24 September 2008, both the French Minister, Mr Jouyet, and Commissioner Almunia referred, inter alia , to the Commission's intention to propose the regulation of rating agencies for financial institutions operating in the EU. Will the Commission say whether it would be advisable to extend the scope of this uniform regulatory measure to include consultancies which advise pension and sickness funds and other general interest funds about where and how to invest their capital?
