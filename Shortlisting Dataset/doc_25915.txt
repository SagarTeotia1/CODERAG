Question for written answer E-006191/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Berlato (PPE) (27 June 2011) Subject: Alarming situation in Syria The situation in Syria is becoming ever more alarming: the clampdown by the Syrian security forces on anti-government protests has resulted in more than 500 civilians deaths and caused thousands to flee to Lebanon. The city of Daraa, now under the control of army tanks, has become the epicentre of the brutal wave of police and military repression unleashed by Bashar Al-Assad on ordinary Syrians demonstrating in support of democracy and human rights. In view of this situation, which is taking on the proportions of a massacre of defenceless civilians such as has rarely been seen in recent times, would the Council say: — whether it would not agree that the serious acts of repression under way in the region call for urgent action by the international community to protect civilians and uphold fundamental rights without, however, resorting to military force; — what political, economic and diplomatic pressure it intends to exert with a view to ensuring that the Assad regime halts the brutal cycle of repression and gives Syrians the same right to freedom of expression as other peoples have?
