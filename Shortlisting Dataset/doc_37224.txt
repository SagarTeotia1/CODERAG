ORAL QUESTION H-0480/06 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Council Subject: Intensification of Turkish aggression in the Aegean with the tacit approval and support of the USA, NATO and the EU The collision of the military aircraft in the Aegean following the violation of the Athens FIR by Turkish fighters, which resulted in the loss of the Greek pilot Kostas Iliakis on 23 May 2006, highlights yet again the aggression of the militarists in Ankara, which is supported by and forms part of the imperialist plans of the USA, NATO and the EU for the Balkans, the Middle East and the wider region of Eurasia. The daily violations of Greek airspace by Turkish fighter aircraft create a serious risk that war may break out with devastating consequences for the population. In recent years, in particular, with NATO having adopted the role of supreme arbiter in the Aegean, the question arises of the partition of the Aegean. Moreover, Turkey's questioning of the sovereign rights of Greece and its aggression are related to the tacit approval and support it receives from the USA, NATO and the EU. Does the Council condemn the Turkish violations of Greek airspace and the Turkish leadership's questioning of Greek sovereign rights?
