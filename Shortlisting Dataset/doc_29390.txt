partly meets the expectations of Parliament, but nonetheless constitutes a real step forward in comparison with the previous situation, Whereas Parliament and the Commission have decided to agree on the procedures for implementing the Council Decision and whereas this agreement with the Commission particularly concerns the implementation of Article 7(3) on the provision of information to Parliament and Article 8 on its right of intervention, 1. Accepts the agreement annexed to this resolution; 2. Considers that all the ‘committees’ which existed before the Decision of 28 June 1999 should be modified in accordance with the new procedures and thus endorses Declaration No 2 by the Council and the Commission OJ C 203, 17.7.1999, p. 1. on the Decision; 3. States that this agreement is without prejudice to its right to adopt any resolution on any subject, notably when it objects to the contents of a draft implementing measure; this agreement is also without prejudice to its right to object to implementing measures referred to the Council following an unsuccessful committee procedure (pursuant to Rule 88 Now Rule 81. of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure); 4. Considers that this agreement between itself and the Commission supersedes the previous agreements (the Plumb/Delors agreement of 1988, the Samland/Williamson agreement of 1996 and the modus vivendi of 1994 OJ C 102, 4.4.1996, p. 1. ) and renders them null and void. B. Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission 1. Pursuant to Article 7(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. , the European Parliament is to be informed by the Commission on a regular basis of the proceedings of the committees involved in committee procedures. To that end, it is to receive, at the same time as the members of the committees and on the same terms, the draft agendas for committee meetings, the draft implementing measures submitted to the committees under basic instruments adopted by the procedure provided for by Article 251 of the Treaty, and the results of voting and summary records of the meetings and lists of the authorities to which the persons designated by the Member States to represent them belong. 2. Furthermore, the Commission agrees to forward to the European Parliament, for information, at the request of the parliamentary committee responsible, specific draft measures for implementing basic instruments which, although not adopted under the codecision procedure, are of particular importance to the European Parliament. Pursuant to the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 19 July 1999 (Case T-188/97, Rothmans v Commission) [1999] ECR II-2463. , the European Parliament may request access to minutes of committee meetings. 3. The European Parliament and the Commission consider the following agreements superseded and thus of no effect insofar as they themselves are concerned: the 1988 Plumb/Delors agreement, the 1996 Samland/Williamson agreement and the 1994 modus vivendi OJ C 102, 4.4.1996, p. 1. . 4.
