supervisor and sectoral antitrust authority can investigate all the possible implications of a doubtful practice on the basis of their respective competences. In order to answer the third question, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that it carried out an overview on interest rates and usurious rates treatment in Member States in the framework of the analysis of the application of Directive 87/102/EC on consumer credit Report on the operation of Directive 87/102/EEC for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit, COM(1995)117 final. . It emerged that not all the EU countries define usury or regulate interest rates proposed by credit institutions to their customers as Italy does. The same report draws a general picture of the national legislation on the issue. Concerning credit institutions’ practice on interest rates all over Europe, the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the European Central Bank (ECB) collect information but publish data only on aggregate basis. More detailed studies should be available at national level. Besides statistics, the Commission also informs the Honourable Member that it is not aware of specific usury problems linked to credit institutions services in other Member States. Finally, concerning the second question, the Commission recalls that it is not entitled to answer on behalf of the ECB. It has therefore transmitted a copy of the question asking the ECB to directly provide view on the issue.
