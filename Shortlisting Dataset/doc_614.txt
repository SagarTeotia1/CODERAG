WRITTEN QUESTION E-0128/07 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 January 2007) Subject: Concern about global warming According to the report by the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases in the industrialised countries fell by 3.3 % between 1990 and 2004. However, this reduction is chiefly due to a 36.8 % reduction in emissions in many of the countries of central Europe with transitional economies. The report points out that in the industrialised other countries, on the other hand, gas emissions increased by 11 %. In the European Union emissions fell by 0.6 % between 1990 and 2004, while the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Greece, Denmark, Lithuania and Sweden are close to achieving the Kyoto Protocol targets. Given that, according to researchers, 2007 will be one of the hottest years in history and that global warming is causing concern in scientific circles, is the Commission considering establishing a binding framework for Member States so as to meet the targets for a reduction in these gases? What practical steps will it take to implement the new energy strategy? Will the ‘energy revolution against global warming’ have any real impact and how much will it contribute to delaying this phenomenon, since those countries which produce most of the greenhouse gases have not signed the Kyoto Protocol?
