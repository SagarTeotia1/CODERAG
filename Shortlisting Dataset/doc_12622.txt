Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) Member States are primarily responsible for the implementation of the directive on the protection of pigs Council Directive 2008/120/EC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs, OJ L 47, 18.2.2009, p. 5 codifies Directive 2001/88/EC. . The Commission is monitoring regularly the state of implementation of group housing of sows in the Member States. From the data received so far from 25 Member States, three Member States already comply and eleven Member States, among them major pig producers, will comply by 1 January 2013. The Commission has been working for several years with Member States and stakeholders to ensure a progressive implementation of group housing of sows. For 2012, an implementation plan is already in place. The Commission is using all the tools at its disposal to push Member States to reach compliance by 1 January 2013. The Commission does not intend to propose postponing the legal deadline of 1 January 2013 for the implementation of group housing of sows. A long transitional period was granted to allow Member States to implement this measure. Postponing the legal deadline would create a situation of unfair competition for those producers who already invested to comply with EU animal welfare legislation on time. The Commission will launch infringement procedures against non‑compliant Member States as of 1 January 2013.
