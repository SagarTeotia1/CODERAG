Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (20 December 2007) The question of the Kaesong industrial zone has been addressed in a number of free trade agreements which the Republic of Korea (South Korea) has concluded so far. Also in the free trade agreement (FTA) between South Korea and the United States, provisions concerning Kaesong have been included. Kaesong raises a number of complex technical and political questions, including the fact that this industrial zone is located in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and it is not part of the customs territory of the Republic of Korea. South Korea has brought up the question of Kaesong in the FTA negotiations with the EU. The Commission has not yet taken a position as to whether goods that have been processed in Kaesong should be covered by a future EU‑South Korea FTA, and what treatment may be accorded to them under such FTA. The Kaesong industrial complex currently is of a limited size with production expected to reach USD 150 million in 2007. The factories producing in Kaesong import all materials from South Korea, process them, and then re-export the finished products to South Korea. As more leases are being sold, operations are expected to expand. The effects on the North Korean economy would seem to mainly derive from infrastructure investments, leases and wages paid, though further examination would seem necessary to also capture mid‑and long term or indirect effects. Korea has raised the question of Kaesong in the EU‑Korea FTA negotiations. The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ROK) has also requested inclusion in the FTA of Kaesong-made goods.
