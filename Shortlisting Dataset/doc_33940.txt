ORAL QUESTION H-0123/05 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Caroline Lucas to the Commission Subject: The use of trade restrictive measures to tackle inaction on global warming Under the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries are required to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This is to be warmly welcomed. However while the benefits of limiting global warming will certainly outweigh the transitional costs of investing in cleaner technologies and practices, some EU industry sectors may feel at a competitive disadvantage relative to corporations in non-Kyoto-compliant countries - since the latter are avoiding these costs at the expense of the global environment. Such corporations are effectively enjoying an unfair advantage or 'subsidy' which, under current WTO rules, could be subject to redress in the form of countervailing duties or border tax adjustments. Noting that the Commission's communication of 9 February stressed the urgency of tackling global warming and the importance of putting pressure on other major emitters, will the Commission raise at the WTO, as a matter of urgency, the question of introducing economic measures of these kinds on the US and other non-signatories of the Kyoto Protocol?
