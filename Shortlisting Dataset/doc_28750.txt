9999/C Q999 E/215 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2539/03 by Karl-Heinz Florenz (PPE-DE) to the Commission (21 July 2003) Subject: Chemicals policy - the REACH System The following questions arise in connection with the Commission proposal for a regulation on the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH). The proposal for a regulation affects the food industry in varying degrees: (a) the general nature of the scope (Point 1) means that in all cases there is a duty to undertake a Chemical Safety Assessment/Report - CSA/CSR - and, where appropriate, draw up a safety data sheet; (b) furthermore, all substances which are not covered by a derogation in respect of Points 8-11 are subject to a registration and authorisation procedure. Re (a)- General scope - Will the Commission explain to what extent food, feedingstuffs and fertilisers are affected by the REACH system and subject to the duty to undertake a CSA/CSR? Will food be treated differently, depending on whether it is used as a finished product for the final consumer, or as an intermediate product or in the non-food sector? - Can the Commission explain why food and feedingstuffs additives do not fall within the scope of the rules? Re (b)- Registration and authorisation duties - Annex II of Chapter II of the proposal provides for derogations from the registration obligation for a number of substances. Can the Commission explain which criteria were determinant in making these derogations? Why is saccharose, but not fructose for example, exempt from registration obligation? - the proposal for a regulation provides that intermediate products shall be subject to a modified registration obligation. Why is provision made for only two locations? - Why are only feedingstuffs containing proteins, but not others, exempt from the registration obligation? - Can the Commission explain on what basis the term 'intended use ' is to be defined and applied?
