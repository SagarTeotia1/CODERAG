WRITTEN QUESTION P-2950/04 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (17 November 2004) Subject: Deportation of a human rights activist On 25 October 2004, the Turkish human rights activist and surgeon Özgür Nizam received a decision from the Ministry of Health at the request of the security police in Zonguldak, where he lives and works, deporting him from his home town to Yozgat. The decision and the security police's request were stated to be based on Paragraph 24 of the Civil Service Regulations concerning the removal within the administration of persons who are undergoing a preliminary judicial examination on security grounds. Such people are not permitted to continue to live or to work in their home town, irrespective of what the subsequent examination may reveal. On several previous occasions, Özgür Nizam had been prosecuted on account of his fight for trade-union and human rights, but every time the court acquitted him. Özgür Nizam, who is well known in Turkey, has for many years worked to survey and draw attention to the Assyrian/Syrian cultural heritage in south-eastern Turkey, which is threatened with eradication. Each time that he has travelled to the region to photograph and document various places there, he has been detained, harassed and prosecuted by the security police. It seems that Turkey does not intend to adhere to the legal principles which it said it would in connection with its candidacy for membership of the EU. What will the Commission do to stop these excesses and ensure that the Copenhagen criteria are complied with?
