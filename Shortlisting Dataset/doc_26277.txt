social situation indicators should be developed which would then be included in the sustainability impact assessment; emphasises that Europe needs a macroeconomic framework to support sustainable development, strengthening environmentally friendly internal demand, employment and social cohesion; 20. Considers that sustainable development should be seen more as an economic opportunity than as a constraint, and as a spur to technological innovation and investment; calls, therefore, upon the Commission to ensure effective coordination of the Union's growth strategies, integrating information and communications technologies and resource-efficient technologies for sustainable development and 'smart growth' both at home and abroad; 21. Believes that a society built on knowledge, awareness and participation, as well as on inclusion and interpersonal relationships, should be promoted that goes beyond the Lisbon Agenda; considers that this will represent a higher quality society and one that, through extended support for ICT, can reduce demand for energy and other natural resources; Reinforcing sustainability governance at national, EU and international level 22. Believes that the SDS requires systematic monitoring if it is to be properly implemented; 23. Resolves to hold a regular plenary debate on the objectives and targets contained in the Sustainable Development Strategy, based on contributions from all of its relevant committees, so that Parliament can state its views on progress and priorities for the SDS in time for these to be taken fully into account in the European Council reviews of the SDS; considers, furthermore, that it should hold regular dialogue with the Member States' national parliaments and the parliaments of the constitutional regions, on a general or bilateral basis, in order to examine best practice on sustainable development, as well as to exchange experiences of both Europe-wide and national implementation of the SDS; 24. Emphasises the importance of national sustainable development strategies within each of the EU Member States, and the need for the exchange of best practice between them; underlines, furthermore, the need for action on the SDS at regional and local level, as well as at the level of individual citizens, with reinforcement of education, participatory processes and public awareness of sustainable development principles; 25. Considers that reviews of sustainability should be a central feature of all impact assessments of new EU policy measures and of 'ex post' monitoring of policy implementation; 26. Believes that action at EU level needs to be complemented by action at international level, with a view to encouraging the promotion of sustainable development principles around the world, not least in the rapidly developing countries, with a view to promoting economic growth and reducing poverty while saving scarce resources and protecting the global environment; 27. Calls, therefore, for more systematic annual monitoring of progress towards meeting the targets in the Johannesburg Action Plan and the Millennium Development Goals; 28. Recognises that developing countries do not have to repeat polluting mistakes of the industrialised countries in the development of their economies; calls, in addition, for the mainstreaming of sustainability principles into the development cooperation activities of the EU and for proper funding to be ensured in order to address global environmental challenges and needs; Complementary measures
