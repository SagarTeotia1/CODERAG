Answer given by Ms Wallström on behalf of the Commission (20 September 2007) The draft Reform Treaty forwarded by the Presidency on 23 July 2007 for examination by the Intergovernmental Conference elevates the European Central Bank (ECB) to the status of an Institution (new Article 9 of the EU Treaty). Under the draft, the ECB's structure, tasks and powers would, however, remain the same as in the EC Treaty. In particular, it would retain its legal personality and full independence in relation to both the EU institutions and the Member States (Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union).
