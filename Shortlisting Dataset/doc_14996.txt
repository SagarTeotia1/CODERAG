ORAL QUESTION H-0458/07 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg to the Commission Subject: Regional policy - new indicators for measuring development of EU regions Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a sound indicator of economic growth and of economic convergence among EU regions and is relatively easy to calculate. However, it is inadequate for measuring social or territorial cohesion. Instead of GDP and unemployment, could the Commission propose other indicators, including qualitative indicators comparable at European level, in order to measure and compare the development of individual EU regions (e.g. showing development of human resources, availability of infrastructure, etc.)?
