ORAL QUESTION H-0843/02 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Olivier Dupuis to the Commission Subject: Voice of Europe In its answer to Question H-0234/02 on the financing of a ‘Voice of Europe’ radio station, the Commission claims that, with regard to Parliament’s budgetary comments, some proposed activities greatly exceed the budgetary resources available and the establishment of a ‘Voice of Europe’ radio station falls into this category. It points out, by way of comparison, that Voice of America had a budget of more than USD 131 million in 2001, whilst the annual budget of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights comes to some one hundred million euros. The Commission states that the inclusion of this priority would throw into question adherence to the guidelines set out in its Communication and the implementation of the priorities in the 2002-2004 programming document for Chapter B7-7. Why does the Commission make reference to VOA and not to Radio Free Asia, which is funded by the US Congress, or to Voice of Tibet? RFA broadcasts in Mandarin, Tibetan, Cantonese, Uyghur, Burmese, Vietnamese, Lao, Khmer and Korean and runs on a budget that is significantly lower than that of VOA: USD 30 million (financial year 2002) as opposed to USD 131 million. Has the Commission looked at the possibility of setting up ‘Voice of Europe’ on a step-by-step basis, gradually increasing the number of languages and hours it broadcasts? Written answer of 9.4.2002.
