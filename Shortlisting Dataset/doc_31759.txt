WRITTEN QUESTION P-3968/06 by Lena Ek (ALDE) to the Commission (14 September 2006) Subject: Annual meetings of World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Singapore The annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are to take place in Singapore on 17 September. In connection with those meetings, the Singapore Government has blacklisted some 20 representatives of peaceful popular movements and refused them entry into the country for ‘security reasons’. The Singapore Government has also exerted pressure on the Indonesian Government to call off a parallel conference in Batam which was intended to gather together organisations from all over the world. Refusing to allow peaceful popular movements to enter the country is a threat to the tradition of an open and constructive debate between such movements and official representatives in conjunction with IMF and World Bank meetings. It is a debatable matter to hold the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in a country singled out by Amnesty International for its shortcomings in terms of restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly, particularly when good governance and combating corruption are on the official agenda for the meetings. Most European governments have already condemned Singapore's action. The World Bank and the IMF have also appealed to the Singapore authorities to revoke the blacklisting decision. It is to be hoped that the Commission will also dissociate itself from this type of action and appeal to the Singapore Government to adopt an open attitude by inviting popular movements to take part in dialogue instead of shutting them out. What action does the Commission intend to take on this matter before 17 September? What is the Commission's position on holding such meetings in countries with a lack of respect for democratic rights and what action will it take to prevent such developments in the future?
