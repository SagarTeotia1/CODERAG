WRITTEN QUESTION P-3920/05 by Marie-Arlette Carlotti (PSE) to the Commission (21 October 2005) Subject: Response to the food crisis in Niger The way in which the food crisis in Niger was managed brought to light the many inadequacies of the international community. Noting the lessons to be learned from these inadequacies — as well as acknowledging the good work carried out by the Commission — Parliament recommended, in its resolution of 8 September 2005, that a twin-track approach be taken: — first, to recognise the hyper-endemic nature of malnutrition in Niger or in other countries in the Sahel region with a view to introducing an overall system for assisting those in need, including access to care for children under five and the provision of therapeutic food products of proven value; — second, to improve the early warning system in sensitive regions where famine may arise, so as to allow for action to be taken at an earlier stage. Can the Commission say what steps have been taken or are planned by way of responding to these recommendations?
