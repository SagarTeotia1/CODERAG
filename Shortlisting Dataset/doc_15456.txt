amounts to EUR 121 190 million, which represents an increase of 4.5 % over 2005. Payment appropriations increase by 5.9 % to EUR 111 969 million, which represents 1.01 % of EU GNI. Those margins remaining below the 2006 Financial Perspective ceilings are EUR 2 505 million for commitments and EUR 7 323 million for payments. 3. Like most of the budgets of the Financial Perspective 2000-2006, the flexibility instrument was mobilised. The ceiling of heading 4 (external actions) was increased by EUR 275 million, in particular for the reconstruction of Iraq (EUR 100 million), the reconstruction assistance to the countries affected by the Indian ocean tsunami (EUR 95 million), Sugar protocol support (EUR 40 million) and CFSP (EUR 40 million). 4. The first question the General Rapporteur for the Budget 2007 needs to address is in which context the 2007 budgetary procedure should be drawn up. The current state of play is as follows: · The Commission presented a first set of proposals COM(2004) 101 final and COM (2004)498 final for a new Financial Perspective and Interinstitutional Agreement in July 2004, followed by a number of legislative proposals to renew the Community programmes which expire at the end of 2006. The so-called 'Prodi package' was endorsed by the new 'Barroso Commission'. · On 8 June 2005, the European Parliament adopted its negotiating position for the next multiannual financial framework A6-0153/2005 . On 17 December 2005, the European Council finally reached an agreement on the next multiannual financial framework 2007-2013. In its resolution of 18 January 2006, the European Parliament “rejects the European Council's conclusions in their current form” but indicates its will to enter into constructive negotiations with the Council on the basis of their respective positions. · On 1 February 2006, the Commission presented a revised proposal of the IIA as requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 1 December 2005. This revised proposal which incorporates some of Parliament's requests and takes on board the conclusions of the European Council is the new basis for the negotiations on the next IIA. It contains no figures. The three institutions have indicated their common goal to reach an agreement under the Austrian Presidency, if possible in April-May 2006. 5. The Rapporteur is mindful that not only can there be no financial perspective without the European Parliament's agreement, but also the agreement on the next Financial Perspective is linked to the agreement on the next IIA. He notes that at this stage the revised proposal of the Commission does not fully take into account Parliament's requests, as recently stressed by the Committee on Budgets, nor is the Council's mandate yet clear. 2. The first Budget of a new financial period 6. It should be remembered that, the multiannual financial framework is not a multiannual budget. In this context, therefore, where 90 % of EU legislation will be renewed after 2006, most of which co-decided, the Rapporteur is aware of the necessity to leave some room for manoeuvre in the annual procedure. 7. In case of an agreement on the next FP-IIA,
