WRITTEN QUESTION E-4496/05 by Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (5 December 2005) Subject: Implementation of the EU/China joint declaration September 2005 In its report on the prospects for trade relations between the EU and China (A6‑0262/2005), adopted by the European Parliament (EP) on 13 October 2005, the EP calls for the Commission to ‘put pressure on the Chinese authorities to take appropriate far-reaching measures to stop the import of illegal timber and wood products, and to encourage China to play a full role in regional and international processes, such as East Asia FLEG, aimed at curbing trade in illegally-sourced timber.’ It is therefore pleasing to note that at the EU/China Summit in September 2005, the two parties agreed to take action to combat illegal logging in the Asia region. What concrete plans and proposals is the European Commission developing with the Chinese authorities to fulfil these commitments? Will the EU and China be able to present a joint programme of work at the next South-East Asia FLEG Conference in Beijing in 2006?
