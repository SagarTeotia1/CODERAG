Question for written answer E-004781/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 David Casa (PPE) (16 May 2011) Subject: EU funding for stem cell research An opinion issued in March by European Court of Justice Advocate-General Yves Bot found that it is unethical and immoral to allow patents from research involving human embryonic stem cells. As long as any resulting patents are filed abroad, EU funding can currently be used for stem cell research in Member States. In the light of the Advocate-General’s opinion, which may lead to a similar ECJ ruling, has the Commission undertaken to reform the ethical review that it applies to EU research funding requests to avoid funds being used for such research in the future?
