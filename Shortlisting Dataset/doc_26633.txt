Question for written answer E-002315/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Judith A. Merkies (S&D) (29 February 2012) Subject: Cattle feed contributes to climate change Methane (CH 4 ), a greenhouse gas, is emitted in large quantities on dairy farms as a by-product of digestion in cattle. Thus, agriculture contributes significantly to climate change. There are various initiatives in the field of fodder development, involving adding enzymes to cattle feed to reduce the eventual emission of methane. This helps to combat climate change. Nevertheless, there seems to be few coordinated actions on the European and global level that also give the cattle breeding sector a role to play in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases in agriculture, in particular by cattle. 1. What is preventing the Commission from making it mandatory for farmers to contribute to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, such as methane, by for example adapting cattle feed? 2. What measures is the Commission taking to stimulate the development and marketing of cattle feed, which helps to reduce greenhouse gases, such as methane, and thus combats climate change? 3. What consideration does the Commission give to animal welfare in the adjustment of cattle feed?
