Question for written answer E-007048/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (19 July 2011) Subject: Data retention In the media and the world of politics at least, data retention plays a key role in combating terrorism. Technically, however, it is only capable of monitoring innocent, ordinary citizens. Data retention is completely ineffective against suspected terrorists, political extremists and operators of paedo-pornographic sites. In order to avoid data retention, it is sufficient to connect via an SSH server. Instructions on how to do this can be found in many places on the internet, for example on Youtube. It is simple to do and can be set up in ten minutes. Data retention means only that service providers must save the IP addresses of their customers for six months. Operators of SSH servers are not obliged to do so. When using an SSH server, only the IP address of the server is stored. This means that the rules on data retention are useless, as potential terrorists can create a completely anonymous IP address. I therefore suspect that the primary purpose of data retention is to spy on respectable citizens. 1. Is the Commission aware that any internet user can legally use an SSH server? 2. If so, why is the EU retaining the controversial rules on data retention? 3. If not, did the EU not obtain expert advice beforehand? 4. How can citizens be certain that they are not being spied upon? 5. Are there specific cases which prove that data retention and similar methods have contributed to preventing terrorist attacks? 6. If so, what are they? 7. If not, how can data retention be considered to be useful?
