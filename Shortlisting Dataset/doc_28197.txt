electronic, universally accessible register of documents and making legislation-related documents, in particular, directly accessible had to be preceded by detailed groundwork. For that reason, Parliament provided in its Rules of Procedure that 'Categories of documents which are directly accessible (and unabridged - rapporteur) shall be set out in a list adopted by Parliament and annexed to these Rules.' Article 172(3), 13 November 2001 version. To clarify matters, Parliament pointed out that that list may not restrict the right of access to documents not set out in it and that interested persons simply need go via the normal channels and make a written application. The list submitted to plenary, together with this report, for adoption as an annex to the Rules of Procedure was drafted by a working party set up by the Secretary-General. In terms of structure, it reflects the more comprehensive general register of documents, which must contain for every document, i.e. for documents not directly accessible, too, a reference number, the date on which it was drawn up or received and recorded in the register, the subject matter and/or a short description of the content Article 11(2) of Regulation 1049/2001. . If the register and the directly accessible documents system are put into effect along these lines, we shall be able to call this a milestone on the road to more transparency in the European Union.
