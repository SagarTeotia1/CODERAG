proposal he has drafted, together with his Irish colleagues, Kathy Sinnott, to add a new protocol to the Lisbon Treaty which would address the issues which arose during the Laval case and 'outlaw ..[..].. the revolutionary decision by the European Court from 18 December last year'. Mr Bonde referred to the reality which now exists in Ireland and in Denmark and the importance of addressing these issues. He urged the Slovenian Presidency 'to raise the question in the summit'. Mr Bonde concluded by asking "when will we have a consolidated Treaty so that we can understand what the content is?" Jana BOBOŠÍKOVÁ (NI, CZ) for the non-attached MEPs said that the Heads of States' intentions to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% and increase renewable energy use by 20% in a few years time is utopian and could have a negative effect on jobs and industry. She also stated that the EU should focus on attracting the "migration of brains" and concentrate on improving energy efficiency and research and development into nuclear energy.

This is a day that we must keep in our memory in order to remember all those who have suffered the barbarities of terrorism. The terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 and in London on 7 July 2005 claimed many victims and left many families in ruins. Unfortunately, just last Friday terrorist organization ETA assassinated again. Isaias Carrasco, a former Socialist councillor, was shot when he left his home in Mondragon. I wish to express on behalf of the European Parliament our deep sadness and profound sympathy to his family and friends. As President of the European Parliament and on my own behalf, I can say that their recollection will never be erased from our memories. Today, we will honour him and all victims with a moment of silence, in order to show, once again, our respect and our commitment to them. Always, they are and will remain present in our hearts and in our work. It is a duty for all of us. I will never cease to repeat, there is no justification for terrorism. Therefore, we must work united in our fight on the basis of the Rule of Law and with all the force of the law." The European Parliament then held a minute of silence. -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20080307BRI23279 FULL-TEXT DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20080307BRI23279 ITEM-003-EN DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS
