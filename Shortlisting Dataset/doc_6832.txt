Certain aspects of these reproductive parts mirror the pollination systems in the Orchid family and represent a case of parallel evolution though both groups are quite unrelated and have developed similar, though not identical means to achieve the ultimate goal of pollination and therefore reproduction.", " Most stapeliads use flies as pollinators, that are attracted to odours resembling dung or rotting meat, emanating from the flowers.", " Many of the flowers also bear some physical resemblance to rotting animal carcasses, leading to their popular name of Carrion Flowers.", " However, not all stapeliads smell bad, or attract flies.", " Some species use beetles, bees, wasps, butterflies or moths as pollinators.", " Stapeliad flowers range in size from mere millimetres in species of \"Echidnopsis\" and \"Pseudolithos\" to those of \"Stapelia gigantea\" that can reach 40 cm/16\" in diameter, and are some the largest of flowers to be found on any species of succulent." ] ], [ "Echidnopsis dammaniana", [ "Echidnopsis dammaniana is a succulent species in the genus \"Echidnopsis\".", " The plants have angled stems and purple flowers.", " It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia and is unusual in collections.", " It can be found at Gibraltar Botanic Gardens." ] ], [ "Lechenaultia", [ "Lechenaultia is a genus of plants in the Goodeniaceae family.", " Some species of this genus are used like ornamental plants. \"Lechenaultia\" species are diverse in form: they may be woody or herbaceous, upright or prostrate with leaves flat, needle-like or virtually absent in mature plants.", " The genus differs from other Goodeniaceae in the structure of the stigma and the fertilization mechanism.", " They are found
