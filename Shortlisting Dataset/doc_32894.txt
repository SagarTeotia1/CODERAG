in Georgia and the South Caucasus region, in cooperation with OSCE, the UN and all other actors, 1. Condemns the recent escalation in tension between Georgia and Russia, in particular the measures taken by Russia against Georgia and against ethnic Georgians living in the Russian Federation following the arrest of the four Russian military officers in Georgia; 2. Reiterates its call for a negotiated solution to the conflicts between Georgia and Russia, in particular over the future of the separatist regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and urges all parties to refrain from inflammatory and aggressive statements which might contribute to increasing the tension; 3. Reaffirms its full support for the territorial integrity of Georgia and calls on the Russian authorities to fully respect the sovereignty of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders; condemns the fact that the Russian authorities continue to issue Russian passports to people living in South Ossetia, and underlines that the EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement should not cover these passport-holders; 4. Underlines that any proposed solution must be acceptable to the citizens of Georgia and to the people in the two breakaway provinces; therefore urges Georgia to clarify what kind of administrative status the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia could have as part of a long-term solution; 5. Calls on the Council and Commission to include the question of frozen conflicts and their resolution on the agenda for the next EU-Russia summits; 6.

Notes that the stagnated peace process needs to be relaunched and calls for an enhanced and combined effort from the European Union and the OSCE to bring the parties back to the negotiating table, based on the progress made in the initial stages of the two peace plans; 8. Calls, as a first step, on both parties to sign the joint document on refraining from the use of force and on security guarantees and to engage in constructive negotiations in order to overcome the present stalemate; 9. Underlines that neutral and impartial peacekeeping operations are essential for resolving the conflicts and points to the need to replace the Russian peacekeepers with another force as part of the overall solution to the conflicts; points out that a new force should contain a strong police element, to combat crime and lawlessness; stresses that such a force should be drawn from states with a proven track record in democracy and with a fully functioning civil society, and underlines that the EU should be prepared to commit troops to a new peacekeeping force; 10 Points out
