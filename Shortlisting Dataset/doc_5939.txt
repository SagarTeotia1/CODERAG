WRITTEN QUESTION E-2664/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Council (18 July 2005) Subject: UN statement on torture at Guantanamo The UN claims in a statement that there are ‘well-founded suspicions’ that the detainees at Guantanamo are subjected to torture. In particular, four senior UN officials, who are experts on the UN Commission on Human Rights, report reliable sources of information as saying that the American authorities at the Guantanamo base torture detainees. They also point out that the US Administration has not replied, since January 2004, to their request to visit the Guantanamo prison camp to investigate the conditions of detention for themselves. In the light of the UN's first public statement that there are ‘well-founded suspicions’ that torture is used at Guantanamo, will the Council intervene to enable the UN experts finally to investigate the conditions of detention at Guantanamo?
