Joint answer to Written Questions E-3410/03 and E-3411/03 given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (19 January 2004) The Commission is aware of the Spanish Government's Environmental Impact Statement in relation to the proposed Ebro transfer. First of all the detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (30 volumes published in June 2003) does include some information on the probable environmental impact on the Ebro delta. However, the Commission is aware that the integrated plan for the protection of the delta has not yet been produced. It is this plan which will establish the management arrangements, including the flow regime, to protect the ecological and chemical status of the lower River Ebro and the Ebro delta. In relation to the possibility of a transfer from the River Rhone, this option was addressed in the Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out by the Spanish authorities and published in January 2002. Finally, with regard to use of Community funding mechanisms (structural funds or cohesion fund) all projects benefiting from Community financial support are required inter alia to respect Community legislation and policies including environmental legislation and policies.
