Question for written answer E-010467/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (16 November 2011) Subject: Competition rules regarding social services A number of the new draft provisions concerning state funding for services of general economic interest require clarification. In this connection, Social Platform also has issued a recommendation that not only hospitals and social housing but also social services should be exempt from compulsory notification requirements. This exemption should apply to all social services of an economic nature and of general interest and to all beneficiaries, particularly in certain social categories. What view does the Commission take of Social Platform's recommendation that lists of state aids contained in Article 1(c) of the package should be considered as open lists, with Member States having sole responsibility for drawing them up?
