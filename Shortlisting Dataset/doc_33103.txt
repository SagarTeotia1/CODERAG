WRITTEN QUESTION E-1897/10 by Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE) and Elena Oana Antonescu (PPE) to the Commission (26 March 2010) Subject: Specific Community financial support for organic farming Producers in Romania have drawn attention to the unfortunate fact that their country is the only EU Member State which does not receive specific Community financial support for organic farming. In 2009, Romania possessed 220 000 hectares of land certified for organic farming, amounting to 2 % of the total cultivated area. The country exported EUR 100 million's worth of organic products in 2008. The producers consider that if organic farming is to be given a fresh impetus the Romanian government will have to ask for the renegotiation of the National Rural Development Plan and request financial support for agri-environmental measures. Can the Commission indicate the conditions under which the above renegotiation would be possible?
