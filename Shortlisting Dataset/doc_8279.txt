WRITTEN QUESTION P-1938/04 by Jamila Madeira (PSE) to the Commission (2 September 2004) Subject: Dutch vessel banned from entering Portuguese waters The Portuguese authorities have prevented the Borndiep (a vessel flying the Dutch flag) from entering their territorial waters on the grounds that their country's laws have to be upheld and that public-health issues are at stake. The Women On Waves organisation had asked to be allowed to dock in a Portuguese port, take on Portuguese citizens who wished to board, and then depart. Does the Commission not consider that by banning the vessel from entering its waters, Portugal has infringed Community rules by obstructing the free movement of persons as provided for in Article 18 of the Treaty? How can Portugal's action be squared with Community law and relevant Court of Justice case-law? What action does the Commission - as guardian of the Treaties - intend to take in response to this state of affairs?
