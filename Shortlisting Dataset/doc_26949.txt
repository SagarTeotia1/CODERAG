that may be destined for Sudan, in particular when those cargoes are passing over the territory of the EU; freight by ships should be monitored as well; c) the use of all legitimate means to promote full and strict observance and compliance by all States with the UN arms embargo and sanctions on Sudan as set out in the UNSC Resolutions 1556(2004) and 1591(2005), including strict prohibitions of arms and military items likely to be used by the GoS in Darfur; d) the design of a stricter and more comprehensive regime of arms and trade prohibitions on Sudan that applies to the supply of military equipment to Sudan from subsidiaries and associates of EU companies; e) measures to avoid the parallel use of means for the transportation of humanitarian aid into the region to transport embargoed military items; 21. Calls on the EU and other international actors to apply targeted sanctions, including measures to tackle business activities that fuel the conflict, to any side, including the GoS, that violates the ceasefire or attacks civilians, peacekeepers or humanitarian operations and to take all necessary action to help end impunity through the implementation of targeted economic sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes; 22. Supports the statement of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu that the GoS "must now be subjected to tough and effective sanctions until the suffering ends"; calls on the AU to back such action against those responsible for perpetuating the violence in Sudan; 23. Calls on the Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, to exert more pressure on the GoS to comply with the positions taken by the UNSC and to emphasise that lack of compliance with UN calls will result in punitive measures; 24. Welcomes the signs that China is now more willing to promote peace in Darfur, and calls on China, as the purchaser of 80% of Sudanese oil exports, to use its significant leverage responsibly in the region to hold the GoS to its commitments under the CPA and DPA; further calls on China to cease exporting arms to Sudan and to cease blocking decisions on targeted sanctions against the GoS in the UNSC; 25. Calls on the GoS to address environmental issues and in particular to reduce the environmental impact of its oil industry and agricultural practices and prevent local conflicts over natural resources; 26. Calls on the GoS to publish the amount of its oil revenues in a transparent way and calls on the Member States to encourage divestment of European companies and funds from Sudan; 27. Points out that power and wealth, now expanded thanks to oil revenues, is very much concentrated in the centre, to the disadvantage of those in the periphery; 28. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Heads of State and Government of the EU Member States, the Government and Parliament of Sudan, the United Nations Security Council, the Heads of State and Government of the Arab League, the Governments of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP), the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the Institutions
