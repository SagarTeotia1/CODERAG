WRITTEN QUESTION E-1639/09 by Richard James Ashworth (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 March 2009) Subject: Cost of EU promotional items The communication and Visibility Manual concerning EU External Actions (dated April 2008) contains a set of guidelines on the subject of ‘badging’ and promoting EU external actions. The document contains detailed suggestions for pens, T-shirts, baseball caps and other items under the banner of Promotional Items. These are marked with the EU logo and are designed to be distributed and displayed as part of any given initiative. The current budget breakdowns do not give figures regarding the amount spent on promotional items since 2004. Could the Commission please inform me of the full cost of such promotional items over the last parliamentary term?
