WRITTEN QUESTION P-2319/07 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (24 April 2007) Subject: Christians butchered in Turkey Three Christians have been barbarously murdered in Malatya (Turkey) during an armed attack on a publishing house that prints bibles. The victims were bound, blindfolded and had their throats cut with knives. The three — two Turkish Christians and a German — had been accused of trying to make converts among Muslims. Islamic terrorism and the religious fanaticism from which it stems are continuing to spread fear and intolerance. Would the Commission not agree that: 1. it should firmly condemn this act of barbaric cruelty? 2. the governments of all ‘civilised’ countries should be called upon not to have any dealings, at any level whatsoever, with murderers of this kind and their supporters? 3. the Turkish Government should be called upon to bring Turkey out of the spiral of violence and religious fanaticism which is continuing to take its toll of victims among Christians, who form a religious minority in the country? 4. a firm and unequivocal response is required from Europe and the civilised world, involving among other things clear rules for the Internet, which international Islamic terrorism is continuing to use as a means of recruiting supporters and fomenting violence?
