Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (22 March 2005) The Commission wishes to point out that, on 18 June 2002, the European Court of Justice ordered France to pay costs for failing to adopt the measures necessary to ensure that all incinerators in use in France at the time were being operated in accordance with the provisions of Community law. Attention was focused, in particular, on the combustion conditions laid down under Council Directive 89/369/EEC of 8 June 1989 on the prevention of air pollution from new municipal waste incineration plants OJ L 163, 14.06.1989 and under Council Directive 89/429/EEC of 21 June 1989 on the reduction of air pollution from existing municipal waste incineration plants. OJ L 203, 15.07.1989 The judgement indicated that failure to comply with these conditions would inevitably mean that these incinerators would cease to operate by the due date, namely 1 December 1990 as regards new plants and 1 December 1996 as regards existing plants. France had therefore failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) of Directive 89/369/EEC and Articles 2(a) and 4 of Directive 89/429/EEC as well as Article 249(3) of the EC Treaty. On 16 July 2002 the Commission sent France a letter asking to know what measures France planned to take in order to comply with the judgement of the Court. On 17 October 2002 and 28 November 2003 the French authorities sent out letters providing evidence that all the incinerator plants objected to had either been brought into compliance or had been closed down. The complainant was informed by letter of 18 June 2004 that the evidence in the Commission’s possession was not enough to substantiate alleged failure to comply with Community law and that all the establishments in question were now operating in conformity with the provisions of the relevant Directives. Given that the complainant was unable to adduce new information likely to cast doubt on the foregoing reasoning, the case was shelved in October 2004. The Commission wishes to point out that, at this stage of the procedure, no financial penalty had been fixed under Article 226 of the EC Treaty. Indeed the French authorities complied with the judgement of the Court prior to the Commission bringing fresh proceedings in the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 228 of the EC Treaty. It is only at this stage, therefore, that the Court may impose on the Member State concerned the payment of a lump sum or fine.
