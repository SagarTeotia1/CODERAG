WRITTEN QUESTION E-1181/07 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 March 2007) Subject: Liability of distributors for correct labelling of food products In Judgment C-315/05 ( Lidl Italia v Comune di Arcole ), the Court of Justice ruled that, notwithstanding the provisions of Directive 2000/13/EC OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29 . on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, a distributor could be held liable and fined for an incorrect statement concerning alcohol content printed on the label of a product by a foreign producer, although the distributor was only selling the product in the form in which the producer had supplied it to him. This precedent could have far-reaching implications for distributors and could induce them, inter alia , to stop selling foodstuffs produced in other EU Member States. Is the Commission aware of this problem, and will it devise a solution to it without delay, for example by drafting proposals for amending EC law so as to make it clear exactly who is liable for the accuracy of the labelling of prepackaged products? Does not the Commission consider that the above case law imposes an extraordinarily heavy responsibility on distributors and retailers?
