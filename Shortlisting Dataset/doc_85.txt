in certain cases lead to an increase in energy consumption compared to the systems they are replacing; calls on the Commission and the Member States to take steps to ensure that consumers are made fully aware of the energy-efficiency performance of innovative systems compared to the technologies that are being replaced; calls on the Commission to come forward with a methodology for rating the energy performance of systems; notes the crucial role that smart meters can play in alerting consumers who change their behaviour or adopt new systems to the overall consequences of these changes in terms of energy efficiency; 30. Calls on the Commission to cooperate closely with third countries in order to make ICTs for energy efficiency more widely available; calls also for the establishment of common standards for energy-efficient products, especially for EU-based Energy Star projects with high achievements in energy efficiency and environmental impact which could be transferred to third countries for implementation; 31. Calls on the Member States to provide active support for the deployment in remote EU areas, such as islands and mountainous and isolated areas, of ICT applications which offer great potential for energy savings; 32. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments of the Member States.
