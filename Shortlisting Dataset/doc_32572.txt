WRITTEN QUESTION E-1498/10 by Alan Kelly (S&D) to the Commission (11 March 2010) Subject: Internal Market — improving communication with Member States to prevent infringements Could the Commission indicate any measures it intends taking to prevent the misapplication or incorrect transposition of directives by Member States? The Internal Market scoreboard indicates that some countries are worse than others when it comes to infringements. Specifically, Ireland has a significant number of infringements due to incorrect transposition or misapplication of directives compared to other Member States. Could the Commission indicate what measures could be taken to enhance the implementation of directives in Member States like Ireland, and across what fields in particular the situation warrants improvement?
