ORAL QUESTION H-0437/02 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Jonas Sjöstedt to the Council Subject: Threat to brand FARC in Colombia a terrorist organisation The political situation in Colombia is, without a doubt, extremely complicated. In order to achieve lasting peace without tremendous loss of human life, the political authorities in Colombia must reach compromises with the guerrilla movement in the country. Calls are now being heard for the EU to brand the FARC guerrillas in Colombia a terrorist organisation. To do so might exacerbate the civil war in the country and scupper any chance of reaching a negotiated settlement for the foreseeable future. What discussion has there been in the Council of the proposal to brand the FARC guerrilla movement a terrorist organisation?
