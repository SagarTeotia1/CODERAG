who seek a separation or divorce. Therefore, the interest of the individuals in obtaining a separation or divorce as an expression of personal autonomy should have priority over the application of national law by applying the lex fori principle. If the law of the competent court does not allow divorce or legal separation, jurisdiction could be granted to a court of another Member State if certain conditions relating to some transborder cases are fulfilled.
