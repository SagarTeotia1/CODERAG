Reply (25 September 2006) Membership of the IWC is open to any country that formally adheres to the 1946 Convention. A decision to become a party to an international agreement concerning matters which are not the exclusive competence of the Community lies with the individual Member States. Currently 17 Member States of the European Union have adhered to that Convention and are member nations of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). In addition, the European Community has observer status at the IWC and has participated in its work, most recently at the 58th annual meeting held in St. Kitts and Nevis in June 2006. As to the moratorium on whaling to which the Honourable Member refers, the Council has adopted the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) on the protection of whales within Community waters, with all cetaceans being listed in its Annex IV. This establishes a high degree of protection for whales whilst prohibiting all deliberate capture or killing of cetaceans in Community waters. Member States are responsible for ensuring effective control, inspection and enforcement on their territory or in the waters subject to their sovereignty or jurisdiction. Furthermore, it is up to the European Commission to evaluate and monitor the application of the rules of the CFP by the Member States. Moreover, the introduction of cetaceans into the Community for primarily commercial purposes is banned pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein, which implements the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES).
