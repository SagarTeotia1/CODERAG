must be mobilised to reduce the demand for illegal goods and services, which would also reduce the crime rate;- industry and the authorities must be encouraged to introduce technical preventive measures; the Commission should consider the degree to which criminals might be deterred by the judicious use of technical aids such as electronic vehicle immobilisers, special security standards for credit cards etc.;- the Commission and Council should submit to Parliament a proposal for a legal act to ensure that all legal decision-making processes at national and EU level can be assessed in terms of their impact on crime;- amongst the various crime prevention measures, particular emphasis should be placed on introducing policies designed to improve difficult living conditions and to reduce social marginalisation since these, within the EU strategy, are identified as factors which generate crime; 14. Hopes that the conclusions will lead to a specific action programme laying down detailed responsibilities and deadlines for crime prevention, especially as Chapter 2.3 of the Action Plan on organised crime, devoted to stepping up prevention, contains many valuable insights on prevention which have not been matched by recommendations; 15. Calls on the Council to keep Parliament informed of further work on crime prevention, and to consult Parliament before any strategic papers on this subject are adopted; 16. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.
