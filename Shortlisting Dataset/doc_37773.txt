review of the Directive finds that this voluntary approach has failed, then stricter measures should be brought forward, they add. MEPs also encourage media service providers to develop codes of conduct on inappropriate audiovisual commercial communication relating to food and beverage products. Industry self-regulation good, but not good enough MEPs stress that the food industry should do much more to tackle the problem of obesity, e.g. by offering a broader range of smaller portion options. MEPs acknowledge the role of recent industry initiatives on advertising self-regulation in fighting obesity, but note that regulation is sometimes necessary to deliver substantial and meaningful change in the industry, particular with respect to children. EU- wide ban on artificial trans-fatty acids The committee calls for an EU-wide ban on artificial trans-fatty acids, stressing that the present state of scientific knowledge shows that excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids (over 2% of total energy intake) is linked to significantly higher cardiovascular risks. Lower VAT rates for fruit and vegetables MEPs call on Member States which have not yet done so to reduce VAT on fruit and vegetables, recalling that Community law authorises them to do so. Furthermore they want the Community texts in force to be amended to allow fruit and vegetables to benefit from a very low rate of VAT. 2008-05-26 Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Johannes Blokland IND/DEM NL 20080526IPR29894 Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety website EN 1 LINK /activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=ENVI -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
