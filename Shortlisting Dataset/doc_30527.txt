195 of the TFEU), which provides that the Union is to complement the action of the Member States; further welcomes the provision that the ordinary legislative procedure will govern the adoption of legislative proposals falling under that title; 27. Welcomes the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has included sport amongst the areas in respect of which a legal basis is laid down (Article 165 of the TFEU); stresses in particular that the Union can at last take action for the development of sport and its European dimension and can take due account of the specific nature of sport when applying other European policies; New powers for Parliament New codecision powers 28. Welcomes the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon will strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the European Union considerably by extending Parliament's codecision powers; 29.
