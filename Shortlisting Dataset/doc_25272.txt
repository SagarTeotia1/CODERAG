Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (12 December 2011) Price differences in motor insurance are in general due to differences in risk structures and costs of claims between Member States and inside a particular Member State as well. The Commission cannot interfere in insurers' price-setting. The abolition of price controls in the motor insurance market has had an overall positive impact on premiums. Moreover, a high number of motor insurers based in Italy and other EU Member States offer their services in Italy which increases competition at the national market. The Commission would in this regard refer the Honourable Member to the Retail Insurance Market Study published in 2010 (http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/insurance/docs/motor/20100302rim_en.pdf). Finally, policyholders in Italy can switch to other motor insurers in Italy or take out motor insurance with an insurer in another Member State if the company is authorised to offer its services in Italy. This may lead to lower insurance premiums and better conditions for consumers. According to the competition rules of the European Union, agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction, or distortion of competition within the internal market are prohibited (Article 101 of the Treaty). However, the events described do not appear to fall into the scope of these provisions as there are no elements to conclude the existence of a behaviour which could amount to an anticompetitive agreement, decision or practice in the sense of Article 101 of the Treaty. There is no indication that the prices for motor insurance in Italy are stemming from an alleged cartel between insurers.
