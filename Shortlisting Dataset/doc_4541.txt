Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (4 May 2006) The Commission has followed the ‘Shwe’ gas pipeline project from the outset. The project arises several issues, one of them being the developmental needs of the countries concerned, and another being the overall implications of the route for the planned pipeline. The latter may have consequences for the population in the areas concerned inside Burma/Myanmar. The exploitation of the gas field by India is based on the country’s huge energy needs and the development of its north-east. The Shwe consortium is comprised of Daewoo International (60 %), the Korean Gas Corporation (10 %), India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Videsh Ltd, and the Gas Authority of India Ltd (together 30 %). The recent high-level talks between India and Burma/Myanmar have not produced conclusive public agreement on how the pipeline is to be built. If Bangladesh is left out, the town of Sittwe in Arakan State could be linked by multi-modal transport to southern Mizoram. Alternatively, a land-based pipeline from Arakan State through Bangladesh is possible, but, would require corresponding infrastructure. The Commission is fully aware of the possible implications for people in Burma/Myanmar, and has made its objections known to the authorities concerned in Burma/Myanmar, India and in Korea. The Commission intends to continue to bring this issue up in the appropriate fora but it is at the same time conscious that the objections raised to date have not produced the result desired.
