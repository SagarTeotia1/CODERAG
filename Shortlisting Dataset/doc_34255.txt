Reply (5 December 2003) The European Council in Thessaloniki confirmed the EU engagement regarding its neighbours, whose stability and prosperity is inextricably linked to that of the EU, and looked forward to the work to be undertaken by the Council and the Commission in putting together the various elements of the neighbourhood policies. The European Council also endorsed the conclusions on Wider Europe — New Neighbourhood adopted by the Council on 16 June last. In order to implement the conclusions of 16 June 2003, the Council invited the Commission to present proposals for Action Plans from 2004 onwards for all countries concerned, to examine measures to improve the interoperability between the different relevant instruments for support to the border areas as well as to present a communication on a possible new Neighbourhood Instrument. On 1 July last, the Commission adopted the Communication Paving the way for a New Neighbourhood Instrument , which provides a basis for developing the relevant instruments aimed at enhancing cross-border and regional/transnational co-operation on the external borders of the Union. At present, the relevant bodies of the Council are considering possible actions for the period 2004-2006 aimed at significantly improving co-ordination between the various financing instruments concerned, while fulfilling existing commitments and obligations regarding the current programming period up to the end of 2006. These actions should be based on the existing legislative and financial framework for cross-border cooperation such as Interreg, PHARE-CBC, TACIS-CBC, CARDS and MEDA. For the period after 2006, the reflection will continue on the different options that the Commission described in its Communication, including the creation of a single New Neighbourhood Instrument.
