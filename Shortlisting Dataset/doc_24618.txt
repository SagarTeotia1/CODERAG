Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (26 June 2009) The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s concern over the situation of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia, and the impact this may have for foreign employees working in the country. Equality between women and men is a common EU value and is actively promoted both in Member States and in the EU’s external relations. The promotion of gender equality outside the EU is listed as one of the six priority areas for EU action in the Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men, adopted by the Commission in March 2006 COM(2006)92 final. . Inside the EU, significant progress has been made over the last decades in achieving equality between women and men, although inequalities still exist. A large body of European legislative texts is dedicated to equality between women and men. Implementation of these legislative texts, and their application by EU companies, remains with the competent national authorities.. As regards the situation of women in Saudi Arabia and the EU’s policy approach to promoting women’s rights in the country, the Commission refers to its answers to previous written questions by the Honourable Member, in particular E‑3644/08 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/home.do?language=EN .
