1. Welcomes the reinforcement of the energy cooperation dimension of the ENP; recalls that security of energy supply through the diversification of sources and demand management, and deeper engagement with main suppliers and transit states remains an EU energy policy priority and that both eastern and southern neighbours remain a key focus of the coordinated EU external energy policy, as well as calls for effective measures to ensure that the principle of solidarity is applied in the field of energy; welcomes, in this regard, the Commission’s communication on external energy policy and its proposal for a Decision on sharing information on intergovernmental agreements; 2. Draws attention to the importance of the eastern partnership in terms of ensuring the EU’s energy supplies; in the light of the creation of new interconnections and pipelines in the gas sector, new interconnections and networks in the electricity sector, new infrastructures and terminals for LNG and new electrical power stations (using fossil fuels or renewable energy sources or based on nuclear projects), stresses the need to establish market rules and transparent and fair conditions for energy transit and trading, so as to ensure a stable future for investment; emphasises that such rules and conditions should promote high standards of environmental protection, democratic participation and health and safety; 3. Welcomes the proposal for the creation of a European Energy Community and believes that it could be an important step towards cooperation with our neighbours; 4. Welcomes the accession of Ukraine and Moldova to the Treaty establishing the Energy Community, in view of its potentially vital role in terms of ensuring the achievement of the EU’s energy security objectives and contributing to security for those countries; 5. Welcomes all efforts towards strengthening of the Eastern Partnership, especially the Commission’s flagship initiatives on SMEs and on regional energy markets and energy efficiency; believes that these efforts should be reflected in the multiannual financial framework; 6. Calls on the Commission to encourage, including through investment, the construction, upgrading and development of smart energy networks and infrastructure interconnections with EU neighbours; emphasises the importance of prioritising projects of EU interest in order to accelerate their development and implementation; notes in particular the importance of the construction and development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure; 7. Calls on the Commission to further develop the EU Black Sea Strategy, as it represents an important component of the EU’s external energy strategy, given its geostrategic role, which offers a significant potential for energy security and supply diversification; 8. Recalls the importance of conventional energy (oil and gas), renewables and energy efficiency as one of the drivers for the economic development of both the eastern and the southern neighbouring countries of the EU by becoming a source of new income and employment, generating new local energy sources, reinforcing the grid infrastructures and allowing for a new industrial component-manufacturing sector to be created; recognises that increased use of renewables is often impeded by a lack of incentives and by the current restricted capacity of grids in terms of receiving and distributing renewables-generated power; asks the Commission to
