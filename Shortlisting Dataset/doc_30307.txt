Question for written answer E-011212/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (1 December 2011) Subject: Measures to help young people in southern Italy take out a mortgage Buying a home is becoming increasingly more difficult, especially for young people in southern Italy. According to a recent study, 18 % of all requests for mortgage offers in southern Italy come from the over-30s, and as little as 3 % of applications are accepted by the credit institutions. In southern Italy a mortgage runs on average for 27 years. Further evidence of the economic difficulties facing young people there can be seen in the percentage of mortgage financing sought for the purchase of a first home. The figures are highest in Brindisi, Syracuse, and Enna, amounting to 79 %, even though property prices are quite modest. The mortgage situation is very different for young southerners compared with the under-30s in the North, where 18 % of applications are accepted, the average duration of a mortgage is 25 years, and the average amount borrowed to pay for a flat is equivalent to 60 % of its value. — Is the Commission aware of the figures reflecting the difficulties that young people have in southern Italy to take out mortgages to buy a first home? — What steps will it take to enable the under-30s in southern Italy to gain access to credit when mortgages are difficult to obtain from credit institutions?
