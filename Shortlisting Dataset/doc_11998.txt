ORAL QUESTION H-1059/07 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Avril Doyle to the Commission Subject: ICT and copyright levies The Commission has spent substantial time and money in recent years analysing the problem of copyright levies. Copyright levies are acknowledged to hold back development of an inclusive information society in Europe. The Commission has consulted stakeholders and Member States on several occasions and has produced impact assessments which clearly show that reform of the copyright levy system is necessary. Indeed, in a speech delivered to the European digital industry on 10 May 2007, Commissioner Reding said she regarded progress on this issue to be: 'part of the unfinished business of this Commission'. Can the Commission explain its current position with regard to the copyright levy system? In particular, can it explain why there has been no action on reform of copyright levies, given that the problems associated with the current system continue to mount?
