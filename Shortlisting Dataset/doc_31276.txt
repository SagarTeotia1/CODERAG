ORAL QUESTION H-0571/05 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Richard Howitt to the Council Subject: Situation in the Western Sahara The EU has an extensive and growing relationship with Morocco, and therefore has a crucial ability to affect progress and to pressure Morocco to accept its international obligations. Can the Presidency explain why the enormous leverage offered by that relationship is not used to push for progress in the unresolved dispute of the Western Sahara, where Morocco's illegal occupation will this November reach its 30th anniversary and where hundreds of thousands of Saharawis suffer under occupation or in refugee camps, forgotten by the world, and where there have been credible and disturbing recent reports of arrests and torture of Saharawi students and human rights activists in the occupied territory?
