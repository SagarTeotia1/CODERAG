Question for written answer P-010225/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Francesco De Angelis (S&D) (7 November 2011) Subject: SMEs and access to money owed With reference to the Commission's answer to Written Question P‑008633/2011 entitled ‘SMEs and necessary access to finance’, can the Commission specify the following: — How many and which Member States have actually transposed Directive 2011/7/EU to date? — What action does it intend to take against those Member States in which the debate on the transposition of the directive makes it extremely unlikely that it will actually be implemented within the time frame set out in the communication ‘A roadmap for stability and growth’? — What measures will it take to encourage the swift transposition of the directive, given that the preannounced information campaigns and reminders sent to the national representatives of SMEs, albeit meritorious, have not yet had the expected impact and that, on the contrary, some Member States are apparently moving towards a further delay in implementation?
