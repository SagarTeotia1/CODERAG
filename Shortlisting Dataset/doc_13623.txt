WRITTEN QUESTION E-1677/08 by Carmen Fraga Estévez (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (27 March 2008) Subject: Problems following the abolition of the 15 % margin of tolerance for swordfish catches Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 OJ L 123, 12.5.2007, p. 3. laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species and repealing Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 OJ L 137, 19.5.2001, p. 1. abolished the fifth Community fleet’s ICCAT‑approved 15 % margin of tolerance Atlantic catches of swordfish under 125 cm or 25 kg. This measure exclusively prejudices the Community fleet at an economically critical moment, which stems, moreover, from low-cost imports from third countries and from fuel costs, when the stocks are in an excellent biological state, according to ICCAT’s own SCRS. However, it is even more incomprehensible that according to Article 9(1), fish under 125 cm or 25 kg ‘shall be returned immediately to the sea’. The regulation was published on 7 May 2007, when one of the Commission's stated objectives was to tackle the need for regulations which would reduce by‑catches to zero, as far as possible. All these issues make the Community legislation contradictory and unnecessarily prejudicial to the Community sector and no one else, something which also betrays another of the Commission’s principles, namely good governance. Given the prejudice caused to the Community fleet by the abolition of the 15 % margin of tolerance margin, without this measure’s having achieved significant benefits, due to the good state of the stocks, and given that the measure is contributing to increased by-catches and reducing the amount of data which can be made available to scientific bodies, what serious arguments, capable of justifying such an anomalous and incomprehensible situation, can the Commission advance for not amending Regulation (EC) No 520/2007?
