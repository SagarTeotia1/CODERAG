1999/C 348 E/102 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0489/99 by Joaquín Sisó Cruellas (PPE) to the Commission (5 March 1999) Subject: Rabbit-breeding sector in Aragón (Spain) The farmers' trade union ASAJA-Aragón has condemned the critical situation affecting the rabbit-breeding sector in Aragón (the region from which the author of this question comes). According to the trade union the sector in question, which has over 600 rabbit-breeding farms in Aragón, has been in economic crisis since the end of the 1998 season; commandind prices of less than 200 pesetas per kilogram for its product, i.e. 70 pesetas less than the production cost. In spite of this there has been no fall in retail prices to the public. In ASAJA's view, this has enabled intermediaries to make illicit profits at producers' expense. In addition, rabbits are imported on a large scale from third countries such as China and can then be sold on the Community market for ridiculously low prices on account of their low production costs. In view of the serious situation in the rabbit-breeding sector as described above, could the Commission say whether or not it has considered the possibility of restricting, as far as possible, such cheap imports of rabbits from third countries?
