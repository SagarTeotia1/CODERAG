Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (4 May 2007) As Bulgaria is now a member of the European Union, its citizens, once released from prison, are entitled to make use of their right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States in the same way as every other citizen of the European Union (see Article 18 of the EC Treaty), subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the EC Treaty and by the measures adopted to give effect to it.
