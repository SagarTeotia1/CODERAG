ORAL QUESTION H-0277/04 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by István Szent-Iványi to the Council Subject: Atrocities against national minorities in Voivodina, Serbia and Montenegro In recent months, there has been a growing tendency towards ethnic violence in the Voivodina province of Serbia and Montenegro. The violence has been directed against national minorities living in the region, such as Albanians, Croats and Hungarians, and include defamation of national symbols, destruction of property and cultural heritage as well as the infliction of serious personal injuries. Despite repeated complaints by individuals and political groups, the central and local authorities are unwilling to take substantive measures to address the situation and bring the perpetrators to justice. Is the Council aware of the serious circumstances in Voivodina? Is it planning to take adequate steps to persuade the Government of Serbia and Montenegro to restore public order and to guarantee the fundamental human rights of ethnic and national minorities? Since the inactivity of the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro constitutes a serious violation of the Copenhagen criteria, might this affect relations between the European Union and Serbia, including any future partnership?
