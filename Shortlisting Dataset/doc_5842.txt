Question for written answer E-8403/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Francesco Enrico Speroni (EFD) (28 October 2010) Subject: Cross-border transfer of registered movable property Does the Commission not think it would be advisable to propose legislation whereby, if a person officially moves to another Member State or moves registered property across borders within the EU, that person might avoid burdensome red tape, such as having to exchange number plates or car registration/ownership documents, with the only requirement being to record the matter on existing documents as well as informing the relevant authorities?
