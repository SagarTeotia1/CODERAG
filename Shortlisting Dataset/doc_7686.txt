Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (24 August 2007) The Commission is convinced that the ability of the European Union to speak with one voice will be enhanced by a common approach in the energy sector. The European Council action plan (2007‑09) on an energy policy for Europe invited the Commission to assess the impact of vertically integrated energy companies from third countries on the internal market and how to implement the principle of reciprocity. The Commission is currently reflecting on this within the context of its work to implement the action plan.
