WRITTEN QUESTION P-2556/07 by Anne Van Lancker (PSE) to the Commission (9 May 2007) Subject: Consequences of application of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 for pensioners with only one pension Further to the Commission's answer to Question P‑1081/07, I would request an answer to a follow-up question. People drawing a Dutch disability pension (WAO) who live in Belgium and those drawing a Belgian disability pension and living in the Netherlands are covered by social insurance in their country of residence pursuant to Article 11(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 OJ L 166, 30.4.2004, p. 1 . . Pursuant to Article 23 of the same regulation, people in these categories who are in receipt of only one pension are entitled to medical care in their country of residence. They are also covered by Article 5 of the regulation (equal treatment of benefits, income, facts or events). 1. Is it true that, as a result of Article 5, people drawing only a Dutch disability pension who live in Belgium accumulate an entitlement to a Belgian retirement pension because Belgium is required to equate the periods of receipt of a Dutch disability pension with periods of receipt of a Belgian disability pension? 2. Is it true that, as a result of Article 5, people drawing only a Belgian disability pension who live in the Netherlands no longer accumulate an entitlement to a Belgian retirement pension? Can or must Belgium cease to equate disability pensions if an individual lives in the Netherlands? Can the Netherlands exempt these pensioners from the requirement to contribute to a retirement pension scheme (Article 16(2))? Does the same apply to insurance against unemployment?
