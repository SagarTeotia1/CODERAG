Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (10 September 2010) Although no dedicated funding schemes exist for the construction of sport facilities, sport related activities (including the refurbishment, extension or construction of new infrastructure) may sometimes be funded by the European Regional Development Fund. This may be the case if they are part of specific strategies contributing to local and regional development, in particular when linked to the promotion of tourism and leisure activities, the support to economic activity and creation of jobs as well as the revitalisation of urban areas. In accordance with the principle of ‘shared management’ of Cohesion Policy, it is the relevant national and/or regional authorities which select and implement the co-funded projects, based on the priorities defined in the relevant Operational Programmes. Pursuant to Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU should promote European sporting issues and develop the European dimension in sport. Funding has been made available under Preparatory Actions in the field of sport (2009, 2010 and 2011) which, however, have no infrastructure dimension.
