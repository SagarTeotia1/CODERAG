exposure to this type of pollution by 20% by 2020, by setting differing percentage reductions depending on concentration levels. Strategy on air pollution The own-initiative report by Dorette Corbey (PES, NL) on the Community thematic strategy for air pollution was adopted unanimously. It calls for more ambitious targets for reducing concentration levels of nitrogen oxides (Nox), volatile organic compounds and fine particles (PM2.5). MEPs also want to see more focus on the sources of pollution, including agriculture and shipping. As with the directive, the report calls for stricter limit values while envisaging longer deadlines for Member States which have taken all possible steps but still have difficulty meeting the limits. The goal of the thematic strategy unveiled by the Commission in September 2005 is to reduce by around 40% by 2020 - compared to 2000 - the number of premature deaths caused by ailments linked to air pollution. The directive, which was put forward at the same time, is intended to replace the existing framework directive on air quality and its daughter directives, the aim being to simplify the legislation and bring its technical aspects into line with the latest scientific findings. This is the first time a proposal has been made that concentrations of PM 2.5 should be reduced. Air pollution - chiefly fine particles and tropospheric ozone - is estimated to cause the equivalent of 360 000 premature deaths in the EU every year. 2006-06-21 Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Chair Karl-Heinz Florenz EPP-ED DE Plenary vote on the two reports: Septembre II (25-28/9 Strasbourg) 20060615IPR09081 Rapports Krahmer et Corbey, amendements déposés et amendements de compromis EN 1 LINK /meetdocs/2004_2009/organes/envi/envi_20060620_1500.htm -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
