WRITTEN QUESTION E-2335/04 by Rolandas Pavilionis (UEN) to the Council (5 October 2004) Subject: Linguistic reforms required by the use of the word ‘euro’ and the German language The decision to use the word ‘euro’ in official EU documents, without adapting the word so that it complies with the grammatical structure of Lithuanian and Latvian, would entail a linguistic reform of those languages. As things stand, it is quite impossible to use the word ‘euro’ in those languages because the final ‘o’ does not exist in the nominative singular in the Baltic languages. Accordingly, the (English) word ‘euro’ must be rendered as ‘euras’ in Lithuanian and as ‘eira’ in Latvian (which uses ‘Eiropa’ to render ‘Europe’). If they are to meet the requirements of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 OJ L 139, 11.5.1998, p. 1 . and use the word ‘euro’ in official documents in their languages, Latvia and Lithuania will have to embark upon a linguistic reform. Normally, national experts adapt all foreign words so that they fit into the Baltic languages. But now the current grammatical structures of Lithuanian and Latvian will have to be changed so as to accommodate the foreign word ‘euro’. The same problem should arise for the German language where ‘euro’ should be written with a capital letter in the middle of a sentence. Does the current requirement to write the word ‘euro’ in the same way in all the official languages mean that, in German, the word ‘euro’ should not be written with a capital letter in the middle of a sentence?
