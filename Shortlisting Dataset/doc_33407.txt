Question for written answer E-9463/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (15 November 2010) Subject: Reducing greenhouse gases During the climate negotiations that were resumed in Tianjin (China) two weeks ago, several ‘developed’ countries with significant forestry sectors announced their intention to put forward a proposal that would allow them to cheat on their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is clear that these countries intend to exploit a loophole that exists in the Kyoto Protocol's LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) programme, in an attempt to get away with increasing CO 2 emissions by around 400 Mt per year without being penalised for it. This involves some very creative accounting whereby future emissions are predicted and the reduction quota for current greenhouse gas emissions is calculated on the basis of this prediction. This move comes at a crucial moment, as 2010 has seen the highest temperatures on record. It is vitally important to block this move, as Europe cannot allow EU countries to push forward initiatives that are at odds with the fight against global warming. It is especially important because deforestation accounts for 20 % of all global greenhouse gas emissions, and because forests play a very important role in mitigating climate change as they store carbon and provide an alternative to fossil fuels. Bearing in mind that the G-77 (plus China) and COMIFAC (Central Africa Forests Commission) rejected the initiative brought forward by the ‘Annex I’ bloc (forested rich nations), and that COP16 in Cancun is fast approaching, what stance will the Commission take when negotiating with the Council on the European Union's common position at the Cancun conference?
