ORAL QUESTION H-0364/05 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by María Herranz García to the Council Subject: Regularisation programme for immigrants in Spain On 14 April 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called on the Commission to put forward, before the end of May 2005, a proposal on the establishment of an information system linking those responsible for immigration and asylum policy in the Member States so that they would be notified of important decisions to be taken by one or more Member States. Meanwhile, the Spanish Government has once again changed the criteria governing the extraordinary regularisation programme currently under way in Spain. It is now possible for immigrants to have their residence in the country authorised even if they were not registered with their local municipal authorities. When and how was the Council informed of the new criteria?
