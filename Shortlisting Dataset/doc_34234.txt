Question for written answer E-000124/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Raffaele Baldassarre (PPE) and Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (19 January 2011) Subject: Fraudulent marketing of olive oil One of the main causes of the crisis in the olive oil sector is the large-scale importation of so-called deodorised oils, to which a small amount of virgin olive oil is then added and which are then designated as having been produced in the place of destination. The immediate consequence of this practice is that the oils that are genuinely produced in the country of sale remain unsold, leading to an inevitable crisis in the entire sector. Despite favourable changes in terms of transparency with regard to the actual place of origin, as introduced by Regulation (EC) No 182/2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1019/2009 on marketing standards for olive oil, the new administrative and accounting requirements laid down in that regulation will only be partially successful unless Regulation (EC) No 2568/91 and subsequent amendments on the characteristics of olive oil and olive-residue oil and on the relevant methods of analysis is also integrated. For 40 years, in fact, it has been known that methyl and ethyl esters of fatty acids (alkyl esters) contained in the waxy part of olive oils are formed as a result of the fermentation and degradation of poor quality olives. These compounds are found in far greater measure in lampante olive oils than in extra-virgin olive oils. As stated above, a common adulteration is to illegally mix oils treated in this way with parts of genuine oil and subsequently sell this fake extra-virgin oil at low cost. In the light of the above, can the Commission say: 1. what monitoring and legislative measures it will take to curb the marketing of deodorised oil, which is fraudulently being passed off as extra-virgin olive oil within the EU; 2. whether it intends to review Regulation (EC) No 2568/91 to ensure that olive oil production methods are compatible with the marketing standards for olive oil set out in Regulation (EC) No 182/2009?
