Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (5 January 2006) From information available to the Commission, it seems that for some time the price of simple dial-up access in Greece has been the lowest in the EU, at 0.6 and 0.3 euro cents per minute in peak and off-peak times respectively, while the EU averages were around 2.2 and 1.1 euro cents, respectively. While it is difficult to measure the total number of Internet users in Greece, because of the prevalence of narrowband dial‑up access, a Eurostat survey in 2004 showed that 16 % of households had access to the Internet. This meant that Greece had the fourth lowest Internet penetration rate in the EU‑25. It should be noted that, across the EU, narrowband dial‑up access is being phased out and replaced by always‑on broadband access which offers users much faster access and a large variety of services. In this respect, data provided to the Commission by the Greek authorities show that although there has been some increase in recent months, in July 2005 the broadband penetration rate was one of the lowest among the Member States amounting to 1.1 % of the population, compared to 0.24 % in July 2004. The EU average was just below 11 % in July 2005. Regarding the cost of broadband connections, it is difficult to compare broadband access retail prices in different Member States, because of the differences in the service packages offered by operators and service providers, in terms of capacity, usage time and bundled services. However, from information available to the Commission, it seems that Greece is one of the most expensive Member States. Competition in the sector is not sufficient and the failure of Greece to transpose the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications Directive 2002/21/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (framework directive); Directive 2002/20/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (authorisation directive); Directive 2002/19/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (access directive); Directive 2002/22/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (universal service directive), OJ L 108, 24.4.2002 and Directive 2002/58/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002. , which would allow appropriate regulation to take place and facilitate competition, is contributing to the problem. For this lack of transposition, the Commission has taken Greece to the European Court of Justice.
