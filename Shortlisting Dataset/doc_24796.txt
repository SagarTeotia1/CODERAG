Reply (18 October 2010) The Council would inform the Honourable Member that, bearing in mind the provisions of the Stockholm Programme, which stipulates that in order to foster a genuine European judicial and law enforcement culture it is essential to step up training on Union-related issues and the fact that a substantive number of professionals, including police officers, should by 2015 have participated in a European Training Scheme or in an exchange programme with another Member State, on 26 April 2010 it adopted the conclusions on the Exchange Programme for police officers based on Erasmus (Doc. 8309/1/10 REV 1). The Council has therefore invited the European Police College (CEPOL) to develop such an exchange programme for police officers. It should initially cover a four-year period. The aim of the programme, which is intended for all agents and officials in police forces in the Member States, is to conduct exchanges for the purposes of study, mutual learning and the pooling of knowledge and best practices in police work. The Council has also invited CEPOL to present, in the framework of the 5 year-evaluation provided for in Article 21 of the CEPOL decision, an evaluation report of this programme to the Council. The way forward regarding the Exchange Programme for police officers and its modalities are currently being discussed in CEPOL.
