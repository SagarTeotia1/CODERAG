Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (15 November 2010) The Union legislation provides for EU support to fishing ports under the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Although the EFF may provide some support to investments in existing fishing ports, this support is limited to improving the services offered within such ports (e.g. for fish landing, auctioneering, processing, storing). This fund therefore does not include support to improving conditions of access to such ports (e.g. channels, roads). As a consequence, only the ERDF appears to be the appropriate fund to support the proposed type of operation. The operational programme under the ERDF for Algarve, for the period 2007‑13, could possibly be a funding source in this particular case, provided the support required is in accordance with national/regional eligibility rules and falls within the applicable selection criteria. Both the ERDF and the EFF fall under shared management. This means that it is the responsibility of the national/regional management authority to call for and select applications. All the necessary information and details on the possibilities to support de-silting projects can be found on the website of the ERDF Programme ‘Algarve’ and by contacting directly the managing authority at the following address: PO ALGARVE 21 — Programa Operacional Regional do Algarve CCDR Algarve Praça da Liberdade, 2 P-8000-164 FARO Tel. + 351289895200 Fax: + 351289807623 E-mail: geral@ccdr-alg.pt www.ccdr-alg.pt The Commission remains at the disposal of the Honourable Member for any further clarifications.
