Answer given by Mr Patten on behalf of the Commission (6 November 2003) The Union-Israel Association Agreement provides for the establishment of a free trade area between the Union and Israel creating a favourable environment notably for the development of trade, investment and economic co-operation. As regards the application of the rules of origin, the Union's interpretation of the Agreement is clear: products originating from the Israeli settlements (West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights) are not entitled to benefit from preferential treatment. As regards the reference made by the Honourable Member to the Oslo accords, these agreements do not deal with the issue of preferential treatment of goods entering the Union since they regulate the bilateral relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Following the Notice to Importers issued by the Commission in November 2001 and the measures adopted unilaterally by the Union, the rules of origin issue has been discussed in the appropriate fora (i.e. relevant Association Committees and Association Councils) where the Union reasserted its position and the Israeli authorities expressed their willingness to explore appropriate technical measures in this respect. This matter is still under discussion.
