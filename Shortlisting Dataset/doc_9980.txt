developing countries; 33. Calls for greater research and development efforts to find more sustainable ways of combating tropical diseases and to overcome the stagnation in developing new vaccines against tuberculosis; considers that the process of putting newly developed drugs to combat communicable diseases into production and bringing them into use in developing countries must be speeded up; 34. Calls on pharmaceutical manufacturers not to remove live-saving, but unprofitable, drugs from the market, as they are necessary for treating diseases in developing countries; stresses that drugs which have been removed from the market for economic reasons should be allowed to be produced by local manufacturers in developing countries through voluntary licences; 35. Calls on the EU, the USA, Japan and other industrialised countries to develop a range of initiatives, including appropriate legislation that would offer financial incentives, for increasing private-sector investment in research and development of vaccines and cheaper medicines for treating communicable diseases that mainly affect developing countries; considers that these incentives should be structured in such a way as to ensure that products thus developed are accessible for use in developing countries; considers that a start could be made on adopting such measures in the course of the next revision, in 2001, of EU medicine-licensing legislation; 36. Calls on the European Union and the industrialised countries to encourage the transfer of technologies and knowledge in order to establish or strengthen capacities for the local or regional production of essential medicines in developing countries and stresses the need to promote voluntary licensing, in particular as regards intermediate countries; 37. Calls on the Commission and the Council to set up a joint undertaking (research agency) under Article 171 of the EC Treaty in close association with developing countries so as to organise and monitor faster release of new vaccines and treatments and clinical testing in the population most in need; 38. Stresses that a global strategy for confronting communicable diseases can succeed only if appropriate and affordable vaccines and medicines are developed for prevention and treatment; considers that such a programme requires commitment to finance the purchase and distribution of these products on a global basis (as for polio vaccine); recommends that a global fund be established to target the three major communicable diseases (FFID - Fund for Infectious Diseases); considers that such an "outcome-driven” fund, under the aegis of the WHO and UNAIDS, supported by the EU, G8, the World Bank, the IMF and open to public and private contributions (public private partnership with NGOs included), can complement ongoing support to strengthen national health infrastructures and promote access to medicines and treatment; considers that allocation to a global fund should be additional to existing aid efforts and be framed in the context of health as a global public health good; 39. Acknowledges that there are safeguards within the TRIPS Agreement to address the imbalance between the protection of patents - essential for continued research and development of new products including vaccines - and the right of everyone to access affordable treatment; acknowledges that compulsory licensing is already provided for under TRIPS in
