Question for written answer P-000905/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sirpa Pietikäinen (PPE) (8 February 2011) Subject: Improving EU air quality: the importance of tackling emissions at source In his statement of 18 January 2011, following a debate in the College of Commissioners, Commissioner Potočnik stressed the importance of continued EU action to improve air quality. According to the statement, the Commission ‘recognised that improving air quality is a pressing need … and that we should immediately focus on improving air quality’. In addition to revising the NEC Directive, the Commission stressed the importance of tackling emissions at source, including from vehicles and machinery. At the same time, Parliament is looking into two proposals by the Commission seeking to relax air-quality relevant emission norms. The first seeks to enlarge the so-called flexibility scheme for non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/68/EC as regards the provisions for engines placed on the market under the flexibility scheme (COM(2010)0362 — C7‑0171/2010 — 2010/0195(COD)). , the second for tractors Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2000/25/EC as regards the provisions for tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme (COM(2010)0607 — C7‑0342/2010 — 2010/0301(COD)). . Non-road mobile machinery is a not inconsequential source of emissions in the EU: an estimated 7 % of particulate matter (PM) emissions and 16 % of all NOx emissions in the EU 27 are produced by this sector. While the overall impact of enlarging the flexibility scheme might not be great when considered in the context of EU totals, the cumulative effect and the impact on local emissions could arguably be significant. In fact, some local authorities, as well as Member States, have voiced concerns about their ability to fulfil the requirements of the NEC Directive should the private sector be granted this increased flexibility. How does the Commission justify what is an obvious inconsistency in its policy measures?
