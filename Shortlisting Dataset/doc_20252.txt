account the most recent scientific reports on climate change, commits to stabilisation levels and temperature targets that provide strong probability of avoiding dangerous climate change, and allows for regular reviews to ensure that targets are in line with the latest science; welcomes the Commission’s proposals in this area; 3. Recalls that in order to limit the global average temperature increase to not more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, it is necessary not only that developed countries significantly reduce their emissions, but also that developing countries should contribute to reaching this objective; 4. Points out that the reduction of emissions in developing countries below ‘business as usual’ levels will be instrumental for limiting the average global temperature increase to well below 2ºC; underlines at the same time that emissions in developing countries must be reduced below 'business as usual' levels, requiring broad support from industrialised countries; 5. Underlines that, in order to allow the necessary mitigation action in developing countries, significantly increased financial resources are needed; 6. Underlines the responsibility of industrialised countries for providing sufficient, sustainable and predictable financial and technical support to the developing countries to give them incentives to commit to the reduction of their greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the consequences of climate change and to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as to enhance capacity-building in order to comply with obligations under the future international agreement; stresses that a majority of such funds must be new and additional to Official Development Assistance (ODA); 7. Recalls its above-mentioned resolution of 4 February 2009 and in particular those parts devoted to the international dimension and to financing and budgetary matters; 8. Emphasises that in the current financial and economic crisis, the EU's objective of fighting climate change can be combined with major new economic opportunities to develop new technologies, to create jobs and to enhance energy security; underlines that an agreement in Copenhagen could provide the necessary stimulus for such a 'Green New Deal' boosting economic growth, promoting green technologies and securing these new jobs in the EU and in developing countries; 9. Calls for the European Council to aim for an international agreement with industrialised countries achieving collective greenhouse gas emissions reductions at the high end of the 25-40 % range recommended by the Fourth Assessment Report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 4AR) and for those reductions to be domestic; 10. Is concerned about the lack of precision regarding the level of the EU’s financial responsibility in the above-mentioned Commission Communication of 28 January 2009; calls on the European Council to make tangible commitments on financing, which are consistent with the global efforts necessary to limit average temperature increase to well below 2°C, when adopting a negotiating mandate for the Copenhagen conference; 11. Believes that such commitments on financing should include, as provided for by the European Council in December 2008, a pledge by Member States to use a significant part of the auctioning revenues generated by the EU ETS to finance actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing
