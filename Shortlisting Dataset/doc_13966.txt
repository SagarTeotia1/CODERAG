Answer given by Ms Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (26 March 2007) The Honourable Member asks the Commission how a difficult situation on the European apple market can be addressed. The Honourable Member refers to restriction of imports and an anti-dumping investigation. The Commission, through its regular institutionalised contacts with the sector representatives, is well aware of the fact that the European apple producers are working in a highly competitive, global market. The Commission understands its task in setting a legal framework that allows the European apple producers to use their comparative advantage in quality production, proximity to the market and consumer recognition. However, the Commission has demonstrated in the recent past that in the case of evidence of a crisis on the market, necessary measures are being implemented. The initiative for transparency on the EU apple market, which led to the introduction of a system of import licenses and, also, the establishment of a round table with the major exporting third countries, has contributed to a successful season in 2006. The Commission does not have any evidence at present that the European apple market is under pressure due to illegal practices of importers. However, if evidence can be provided, the Commission will act immediately. The Commission is confident that the proposal for the common market organisation (CMO) ‘fruit & vegetables’ reform which is currently being discussed in the Council will lead to a new legal framework that will allow the European producers to become more competitive and thus succeed on the market.
