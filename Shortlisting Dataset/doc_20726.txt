into consideration in the discussions on International Accounting Standards; 6. Demands that the Commission speed up the work on legislation to provide for collective responsibility of board members for financial statements, and in general to enhance corporate governance disclosure requirements; 7. Calls on the Commission to speed up work on information and disclosure with regard to a group’s structure and intra-group relations by revision of the Seventh Company Law Directive in order to provide more transparency, and in this connection asks that the Commission reflect on ways to make features such as special-purpose vehicles and tax‑haven subsidiaries more transparent; 8. Reminds the Council and Commission that the ongoing discussions on the Transparency Directive must bring real benefits to investors and the public at large in relation to disclosure requirements, with quality information at the right time, and not mandatory quarterly reporting, which, as the present Parmalat case, or indeed the Enron case, shows, does not prevent financial scandals; 9. Requests that the Commission, in view of the possible role played by CONSOB, the Italian regulator, in connection with the Parmalat case, inform Parliament and the Council of possible new initiatives on financial supervision; 10. Is of the opinion that part of the long-term solution must be a single authority for financial prudential supervision in Europe; 11. Reminds both the Council and the Commission that a balance must always be struck between the legitimate need for national authorities, shareholders, other investors and the public to receive relevant and timely information, and, on the other hand, the administrative burdens and amount of red tape imposed on European companies; 12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to Council, the Commission, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the parliaments of the Member States.
