WRITTEN QUESTION E-3886/09 by Paul Rübig (PPE) to the Commission (5 August 2009) Subject: Machinery Directive: request for a transitional period to allow TOPS-tested and approved machinery to be delivered up to the end of 2010 Under the existing Directives 89/392/EEC OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 9 . and 98/37/EC OJ L 207, 23.7.1998, p. 1 . on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to machinery, the testing to which the various excavator models produced by a particular company are subject includes checking that protective ‘safety cabs’ meet the relevant requirements on operator protection. The cabs in question undergo rigorous prescribed testing as well as risk analysis (TOPS test). Cabs that have passed the tests and are mounted on excavators within a prescribed size range (≤ 6 tonnes) may be placed on the market up to 29 December 2009. From 1 January 2010 onwards, excavators within this size range will have to be sold with cabs that have that have undergone more extensive (ROPS) testing, currently applicable only in respect of larger machines. During the second half of 2008, on the basis of advance orders and projections, the firm in question produced some 700 excavators of the size in question and had them tested in accordance with Directive 98/37/EC as then applicable. It is currently estimated, however, that, as a result of cancellations and the collapse in order volumes from the third quarter of 2008 onwards, some 360 machines will remain unsold at the end of 2009. Under the terms of the directive, machines already checked and approved under the TOPS test (EN) procedure would have to be fitted with new cabs to meet the updated requirements, at a cost of EUR 3 000-3 500 per machine. Monitoring of cabs already in use has shown that the TOPS-tested cabs have a high safety margin — 40 % — and that there are no safety-based grounds for concern about bringing such cabs into use after 1 January 2010 when the Machinery Directive comes into force. The safety cab that meets the requirements of the new Machinery Directive has already been successfully tested in accordance with the new authorisation procedure and it is already being fitted to all newly manufactured excavators in the 6-tonne class. Would the Commission consider allowing a transitional period up to the end of 2010 so that the machines unsold at the end of 2009 — which were subject only to TOPS testing and approval — can be delivered?
