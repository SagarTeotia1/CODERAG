WRITTEN QUESTION E-0372/07 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (7 February 2007) Subject: Rigged prices of aviation fuel in Greece Last year the Director-General of the Greek Competition Committee submitted a recommendation that two oil companies should be fined EUR 4 million and EUR 9 million, respectively, for rigging prices (forming a cartel) in aviation fuel. According to Greek press reports, the heads of the ministry to which the above committee is answerable, Minister Sioufas and Secretary of State Papathanasiou, intervened and put pressure on the Director-General of the Competition Committee to review his recommendation. Since then the case has been shelved. Is the Commission aware of this matter? Since a cartel in aviation fuel would impact intra-Community trade (airlines of other Member States would be affected), why does the Commission not launch its own investigations, independently of the investigation of the Greek Competition Committee, on the basis of Article 81 of the EU Treaty? This article prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, and in particular those which directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions. Will the Commission say whether its Competition DG intends to launch an investigation? If it identifies a violation, will it impose a fine which the undertakings in question will be forced to pay without there being any scope for political personalities to intervene and use their influence, as occurred in this case?
