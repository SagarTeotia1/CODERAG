FEMM Report on women in prison to be adopted in FEMM The report on the Situation of women in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life, by Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (EPP-ED), is another report to be voted at the next Committee meeting. It draws the attention to the fact that prisons still remain geared towards male prisoners and tend to ignore the specific problems of women in prison. (28/1/2008 at 16.00) 20080128CAN19719
