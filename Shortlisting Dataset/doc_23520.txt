Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (1 July 2011) The ‘Science in society’ part of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007‑13), through its annual work programmes, continues to support partnerships between civil society organisations and research organisations. So far, circa EUR 270 million have been spent in FP7 on Science in Society. This support is implemented in particular in the context of mobilisation and mutual learning action plans, gathering in the same consortia researchers, policy‑makers, industry, civil society organisations, media, etc. The Commission launched a broad stakeholder consultation in February 2011 with the Green Paper ‘From challenges to opportunities: Towards a common strategic framework for EU research and innovation funding’ COM(2011)48 of 9.2.2011. . The Green Paper addresses indeed the issue of the involvement of the general public and civil society organisations in research and programming activities in its question 13 ‘How could EU research and innovation activities attract greater interest and involvement of citizens and civil society?’. The Commission is currently analysing the contributions to the consultation, which was closed on 20 May 2011. The answers to this public consultation are a key contribution to the preparation of the common strategic framework for EU research and innovation funding which will be formally put forward to the Council and the European Parliament by the end of 2011.
