Question for written answer E-007764/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (25 August 2011) Subject: Dubious assertions on the part of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood that an understanding has been reached with the Copts In recent weeks Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood has made a number of statements to the effect that the Coptic authorities have pledged their support for the Muslim Brotherhood and for the political party that represents it, the ‘Freedom and Justice Party’. They maintain in particular that the Coptic authorities are prepared to accept Islamic (‘Sharia’) law as the basis for Egyptian legislation. However, many Coptic sources have denied these claims, drawing attention first and foremost to the fact that the Coptic community is multi-centred and does not have a central authority that can take decisions for the community as a whole. Although some members of the Coptic community have given their support to the Muslim Brotherhood, many others are not at all of the same mind and continue to oppose the organisation, considering it to be completely untrustworthy. The Muslim Brotherhood has therefore not gained the support of the Coptic community as such. In light of these clarifications from Coptic sources, does the Commission consider that, by making these statements, the Muslim Brotherhood has been attempting to mislead international observers into thinking that all Egyptian Christians support their organisation? If so, can the Muslim Brotherhood still be considered to be a trustworthy partner in political dialogue?
