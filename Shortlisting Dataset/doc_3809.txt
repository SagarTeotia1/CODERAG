WRITTEN QUESTION P-5642/09 by Marc Tarabella (S&D) to the Commission (12 November 2009) Subject: Unfair practices on airline ticket-selling websites The European Commissioner for Consumer Protection recently presented the results of an in-depth study, led by Norway, of the ticket-selling websites of 24 major European airlines. This study has once again highlighted unfair practices and misleading advertising that have been employed for several years, in particular in calculating the final price of tickets, which ultimately includes a series of taxes, supplements, check-in fees, luggage fees, credit card handling fees, Internet booking fees and so on. However, on 14 May 2009 the Commission stated that airlines had taken a ‘step in the right direction’ in terms of compliance with consumer protection rules. 1. For how long will the Commission continue to conduct and finance studies that only serve to confirm the existence of unfair practices witnessed every day by members of the public booking airline tickets online? 2. When will the promised industry-wide agreement between the Commission and the airlines come into force? 3. How does the Commission intend to punish this unacceptable behaviour and secure reimbursement for consumers who have been deliberately misled?
