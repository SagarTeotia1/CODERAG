contribution to improving urban transport, which is used by millions of Europeans every day; in that connection, welcomes the Green Paper on transport in urban and metropolitan areas, which should identify the challenges and possible new actions, including early actions and responsibilities; 37. Welcomes the Community strategy on health and safety at work for the period 2007-2013, launched by the Commission in February 2007, that stresses the importance of negotiations between the social partners on preventing violence and harassment at the workplace; in that connection, calls on the Commission to monitor its effectiveness and its effective and prompt transposition into national law; 38. Welcomes the Commission’s contribution to shaping health policy in placeEurope, with the aim of establishing a Community framework for safe, high-quality and efficient health services throughout the EU; 39. Underlines the fact that an effective European health strategy calls for improved cooperation between health services, in order to guarantee patient safety wherever healthcare is provided and address uncertainties over the application of Community law to health services, to provide information on the consequences of lifestyle changes, and to address the challenges posed by a healthy ageing population; 40. Supports the highly valuable initiatives taken by the Commission in order to guarantee the right of European citizens to healthcare and to set high standards for patient treatment; welcomes the proposal for a directive on cross-border healthcare and stresses the importance of the implementation of such a proposal for many European citizens; 41. Recognises the European added value of tackling at Community level the determinants of rare diseases, sharing expertise and information, and urges the Commission to set up as a priority and to facilitate the development of a European policy of research into rare diseases; 42. Considers that the extension of legal protection against discrimination, as set out in the directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, is at odds with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality; takes the view that, since anti-discrimination laws exist in every Member State, there is no need to introduce any legal framework at Community level to fight such forms of discrimination and enforce the principle of equal treatment outside the field of employment; Education 43. Considers that the Commission should continue to focus citizens' attention on the importance of cultural diversity and, therefore, dialogue between cultures in an enlarged Union; takes the view that intercultural dialogue should be also strengthened outside Europe’s borders and become a bridge towards mutual comprehension, thus helping to prevent or resolve social and human conflicts; Security of citizens 44. Supports the view that the EU must fight against crime and violence in order to protect citizens, and that to this effect law enforcement and criminal investigation will be pursued across the EU; in that connection, since security is central to Europeans’ well-being, also supports the measures that the Commission wants to implement in order to combat terrorism, terrorist propaganda and the transfer of expertise - such as in the area of explosives - for terrorist purposes,
