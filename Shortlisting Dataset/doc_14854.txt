Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (17 September 2010) The Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to the decision on the Case N725/2009 — ‘Establishment of a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA): Asset relief scheme for banks in Ireland’ Commission decision of 26.2.2010 ‘Establishment of a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA): Asset relief scheme for banks in Ireland’, OJ C 94, 14.4.2010, p. 10. . According to section VI of the decision, the Commission concludes ‘that the introduction of the asset relief scheme for certain financial institutions in Ireland constitutes a state aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU. Since the abovementioned measure fulfils the requirements of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, as a scheme it is compatible with the internal market, with the result that the Commission raises no objections’. Regarding the potential subsidy to property developers mentioned by the Honourable Member, the Commission would like to note that, in its opinion, such situation does not arise. NAMA is a vehicle that is acquiring loans from a number of participating institutions. The participating institutions receive a compensation that is based on the long term economic value of the loans. This value is in most instances higher than the current market value, thus constituting state aid, which the Commission found compatible with the internal market. The beneficiary of the aid, however, is the participating institutions and not the property developers whose loans are transferred. As a consequence of the transfer of loans, NAMA becomes the new creditor, which is entitled to receive the proceeds from the original loans. In that sense, the borrowers are not affected by the change of ownership of the loans. Consequently, the operations of NAMA under the terms notified by the Irish authorities to the Commission do not entail state aid in favour of property developers.
