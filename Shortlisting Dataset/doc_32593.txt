Question for written answer E-4132/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Alfredo Antoniozzi (PPE) (11 June 2010) Subject: Fine collection system used by the municipality of Etterbeek (Brussels) - breach of EU legislation The municipality of Etterbeek (Brussels) has a system whereby fines (for infringements of the highway code in cases where drivers of foreign- (i.e. non-Belgian-) registered vehicles have been caught in the act of committing an offence within the municipal area) are collected with the aid of a British-based debt-collecting company, Euro Parking Collection plc. The questioner has received numerous complaints from members of the public who may have been fined only a modest amount, say for failure to display a parking ticket, but, according to the first notice of payment sent to the vehicle owner’s home address, have to pay the original fine plus an extra 150%. For example, if the fine for failure to display a parking ticket is EUR 12, the amount specified in the notice of payment will be EUR 30. The notices of payment issued by Euro Parking Collection plc (acting as the agent of the issuing authority, the municipality of Etterbeek, as stated in the text of the notices) also warn that if the sum is not paid within the time limit, it will be increased further. Without detracting from the obligation to pay fines, even when an offence occurs in a Member State other than the country of registration of the vehicle involved, does the Commission think it right for Euro Parking Collection plc to act in this way and employ a cross-border debt collection procedure for and on behalf of the municipality of Etterbeek? It seems clear that EU legislation is being violated, including the rules relating to the EU regulatory framework for debt collection and the recovery of small claims, the regulations to protect users of public services and shield consumers from unfair and abusive practices, and other EU legislation applicable to cases of the type concerned. The notice of payment is only the first warning to be sent to a vehicle owner (who often might not be aware of the fine, assuming that the vehicle had not been stopped; a driver could, for example, incur a fine for exceeding the speed limit without having been booked at the time of the offence). The notices come from a private company, as opposed to a judicial authority; they do not provide proper information to the recipient and, at the time of receipt, already raise the amount to be paid by 150% over and above the original fine; they do not set out the procedure for lodging an appeal; and they are legally flawed in other respects indicative of grossly abusive and unfair practice. Given that the Commission is aware of the problem and has submitted a proposal for a directive on a European database system to facilitate fine collection in the Member States, does it not believe that it should immediately stamp out such practices, which in this case, moreover, are being enforced by a private company acting in a manner totally contrary
