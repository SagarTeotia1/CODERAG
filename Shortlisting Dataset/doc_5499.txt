Joint answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-2387/10 , E-2388/10 (7 June 2010) The Commission is aware of the damage to cultural heritage in the northern part of Cyprus. In this context, the Commission appreciates the agreement dated 21 March 2008 between Mr Christofias and Mr Talat on the establishment of a bi-communal Technical Committee on Cultural Heritage. In a press statement of 6 May 2009, this committee confirmed its belief ‘that it is the primary responsibility of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to protect the endangered cultural heritage of the island … it is important for these monuments to be preserved not only because they are important symbols for the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, and for humanity but also because they have intrinsic values in themselves.’ Concerning the preservation of religious monuments, in the European Union, responsibility in the field of protecting cultural heritage lies with the Member States. This implies that the Commission cannot interfere with the way national cultural heritage is protected, conserved, restored or regenerated nor can it judge the efforts being made at a national level to safeguard or regenerate such heritage. The Commission also informs and provides assistance to cultural actors interested in applying for funding from the Culture Programme through Cultural Contact Points which have been established in all countries taking part in the Programme The contact details of those Cultural Contact Points are available at the following web address: http://ec.europa.eu/culture/annexes-culture/doc1232_en.htm . The regrettable situation mentioned in the Honourable Member's questions again confirm the need for a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus problem leading to the re-unification of the island.
