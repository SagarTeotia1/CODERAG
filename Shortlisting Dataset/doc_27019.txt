Answer given by Mr Figel’ on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2006) The strategy of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation is an internal management tool which aims to make the most efficient use of existing resources. 1. The Commission would like to assure the Honourable Member that the overall number of linguistic staff will not be reduced; part of the existing translation capacity will be allocated to tasks linked with multilingualism such as web translation, terminology, etc., which are in increasing demand as they constitute a means of communicating directly with the citizens. There will be no budgetary implications, nor will there be any negative consequences for the EU’s communication with the citizens. 2. There is no connection between the management tool mentioned above and the fact that Castilian exists alongside Catalan, Basque or Galician.
