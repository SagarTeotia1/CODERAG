Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (8 July 2005) Under Article 8(1)(d) of the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, the issuing judicial authority, as identified pursuant to Article 6(1) is responsible for defining the nature and legal classification of the offence, particularly in the respect of Article 2. It would therefore be for this authority to consider whether the category of computer-related crime, as defined by the law of the issuing Member State, may or may not include ‘offences of speech committed by the placing of information on the Internet’. According to Article 34(2), the Commission shall only be informed of the text of the provisions transposing into national law the obligations imposed on Member States under this framework decision. Nevertheless, the Commission is aware that a few Member States might have established, for information purposes, a list of offences in their national legislations which correspond to the categories of the aforementioned Article 2(1).
