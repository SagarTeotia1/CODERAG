Question for written answer E-7916/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Axel Voss (PPE) and Renate Sommer (PPE) (4 October 2010) Subject: Revision of the Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC) The Commission is currently engaged in revision of the Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC OJ L 105, 13.4.2006, p. 54. ). The directive, as it stands, requires telecommunications companies to store all their customers’ communications traffic data. The risk of data breaches and misuse of confidential data cannot be ruled out here. Increasingly, in some countries, specific reservations are being voiced about the constitutionality of the provisions. In particular, the German Federal Constitutional Court, in its judgment of 2 March 2010 (1 BvR 256/08, 1 BvR 263/08, 1 BvR 586/08), criticised the violation in certain circumstances of people’s right of self-determination over their personal data as well as the disproportionate nature of the requirement to keep, without specific reason, records of all telecommunications traffic. We, as Members of the European Parliament, share the constitutional reservations expressed in the Member States and we therefore wish to ask the Commission some specific questions. 1. How is the Commission influenced, in the evaluation of the directive, by the Member States’ constitutional reservations? 2. Will there be opt-out provisions for Member States whose constitutional order makes implementation of the directive problematic? 3. Has the Commission given any consideration to special protection for data transmitted in the context of a specific relationship of trust — to lawyers, journalists or advice centres, for example?
