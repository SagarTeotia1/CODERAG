Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2005) The Energy Tax Directive Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity, OJ L 283, 31.10.2003 , as last amended by Council Directive 2004/75/EC of 29 April 2004, OJ L 157, 30.04.2004 . sets the Community framework applicable to the taxation of motor fuels. As it harmonizes the structures of the excise duties, the Directive approximates the tax rates. Indeed, minimum rates only are defined: € 302 and € 359 respectively for 1000 litres of diesel and unleaded petrol Without prejudice to transitional arrangements put forward by the Directive. . Member States are free to apply duty rates above these minimum levels. At present, while VAT is 20%, Italy applies the following rates: € 403 for diesel and € 559 for unleaded petrol. These figures are slightly above the EU 15 average. The Commission is not in favour of the idea of using the tax instrument in order to cushion the impact of crude oil price increases on consumer prices. For the Commission, a genuine upward harmonisation of excise duty on fuel is needed, both in view of ensuring the good functioning of the internal market, and in view of its environmental objectives, notably under the Kyoto protocol. Indeed the taxation on oil products has to be seen as a way to integrate into the price paid by the consumers the negative environmental externalities, in particular greenhouse gas emissions. However, the unanimity requirement for the adoption of tax legislation remains a difficult hurdle for making progress on this matter. It must also be borne in mind that excise duties on motor fuels are an efficient means of raising budget revenues for the Member States. Finally, it is not within Community competences to impose measures on how oil prices should be advertised in the Member States. Subsidiarity should clearly apply in this field.
