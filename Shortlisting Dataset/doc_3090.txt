the PNR data may be used. The Commission's aim is to limit the duration of the new agreement with the US so that it expires, like the current agreement, on 28 November 2007. At that point in time, there will be an opportunity to re-evaluate the situation and consider whether any substantive amendments to the agreement may be appropriate. The Court took the view that transferring PNR data to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is intended to safeguard public security and promote law enforcement, outside the scope of the Data Protection Directive, and that the primary aim of the international agreement is the fight against terrorism and serious crime. In view of this analysis by the Court the question of PNR transfers to the US authorities clearly falls outside the scope of negotiations which organise the air transport services on both sides of the Atlantic and do not target the exchange of information to combat crime. It should also be noted that, according to the Court’s judgment, the new agreement on PNR has to be in place before 30 September 2006. This reduced time limit does not correspond to the timescale of the current negotiations with the US on an air navigation service agreement.
