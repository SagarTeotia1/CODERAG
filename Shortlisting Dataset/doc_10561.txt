Joint answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-5999/10 , E-6091/10 (24 September 2010) According to the information available to the Commission, the Albanian Government supports the enforcement of the international court decision in this case, once all legal procedures are completed, notably the validation of the arbitration award by the national appeal court. The 1958 New York Convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards was ratified by Albania in 2001. Precise data on the level of compliance of Albania with decisions by international arbitration bodies are not available. Since the respect for the country's international obligations and the improvement of the economic and business climate are important elements for the fulfilment of the political and economic criteria for accession, as well as commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the Commission closely monitors Albania's progress in these areas. The Commission's latest Progress Report on Albania identified weaknesses as regards the capacity of the Albanian legal system to contribute to the enforceability of contracts and the overall strengthening of the rule of law. To this end, the Commission provides funds and technical assistance for strengthening the rule of law and building up capacities in the Albanian judiciary. The Commission Opinion on the Albanian application for EU membership, which is currently being prepared, will also review these issues.
