point, asking why two signatures of his colleagues had not been validated, as he had personally been present when the individuals concerned had signed the document. President Cox explained that the verification required had not been received from the two individuals. While they were not presently on the list of validated signatories, there were in any case sufficient signatures for the motion to be debated and put to the vote. The motion of censure is likely to be the first vote of Parliament's May sitting. Statements Minute's silence for Fabrizio Quattrocchi 19.04.2004 At the opening of the session President Pat COX told MEPs it was his sad duty to mark the cowardly murder at the hands of terrorists in Iraq of Italian citizen Fabrizio QUATTROCCHI . He continued: "The European Parliament unreservedly condemns this despicable crime. We express our feelings of deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of the victim and to the Italian government and citizens. I appeal to the kidnappers to immediately free all other hostages still in captivity." He concluded by saying that the holding of hostages for political ends could only serve to compromise the objective of handing Iraq back to the Iraqi people. MEPs then observed a minute's silence. Changes to the agenda 19.04.2004 Parliament agreed the following changes to the agenda: 1. The report by Jan MULDER (ELDR, NL) and Neena GILL (PES, West Midlands) draft amending budget No. 3/2004 ( A5-0256/2004 ) has been withdrawn. The Council had accepted all of Parliament's amendments, so this was no longer needed. 2. The report by Christa RANDZIO-PLATH (PES, D) on the appointment of a member of the ECB Executive Board ( A5-0273/2004 ) was voted on Tuesday. 3. A Commission statement on Eurostat was added to the agenda. This took place alongside the debate on the budget discharge for 2002 on Tuesday, followed on Thursday with votes on related resolutions. 4. Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East were added to the agenda for Wednesday, with resolutions voted on Thursday. 4. Thursday's sitting began at 9am with the voting session starting at 11am. This included the report by Johanna L.A. BOOGERD-QUAAK (ELDR, NL) on freedom of expression and information ( A5-0230/2004 ) previously scheduled for Wednesday's votes.
