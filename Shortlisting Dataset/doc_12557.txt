Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (25 January 2005) The Honourable Members will certainly appreciate that, following the practice in Member States, the Commission has a policy of not commenting in detail upon security-related issues. However, with regard to their two specific questions, the Commission can on the one hand confirm that, as indicated in the reply to the parliamentary written question E-1536/04 OJ C , the Danish authorities did not pursue proceedings against Mr Jung Olsen as the deadline set in the Danish Statute of Limitations had passed. The Commission is grateful to the Honourable Members for allowing it the opportunity of confirming this fact and clarifying the ambiguity created, in this specific respect, by the previous reply to the parliamentary question E-0388/03 . On the other hand, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Members that an internal assessment has been carried out by the Commission on the basis of currently available data, following which the Commission has come to the conclusion that no further actions are required in this case.
