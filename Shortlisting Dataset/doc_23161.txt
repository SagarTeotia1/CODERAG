Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (2 May 2011) The Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to the reply given to Written Question E‑11006/10 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/ . The issue of sky lanterns was discussed between the Member States and the Commission experts on 10 February 2011. Several Member State authorities have already adopted measures with regard to sky lanterns under the current legal framework. The Commission also asked the Member States to submit data about risks to consumers caused by these products, as well as information relating to the national measures already in place. Further discussions may be held if the data points to particular issues that should be addressed via coordinated action.
