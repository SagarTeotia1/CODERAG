Question for Question Time H-0420/2010 to the Commission Part-session: September II 2010 Rule 116 Salvatore Iacolino (PPE) Subject: Oil drilling in the Mediterranean A few months after the incident in the Gulf of Mexico and under an agreement concluded in 2007, British Petroleum is apparently preparing to begin drilling five new oil wells in Libyan territorial waters some 600 kilometres from the coasts of Sicily, Malta and Greece. In view of the extraordinary biodiversity of the Mediterranean and the fact that it is a closed sea with limited water renewal, will the Commission answer the following questions: Will it introduce stricter controls on drilling at sea and, if so, how? Would it be feasible to introduce a moratorium on drilling in the Mediterranean? Will it urge Libya to take account of the cross-border environmental impact of these operations? Will it consider introducing the offence of environmental crime at European level so as to deter hazardous activities in areas belonging to the Member States? Will it examine the possibility of binding oil companies operating in Europe to a strict code of conduct that will safeguard the public and the environment, as well as business activities of the kind successfully developed over time in the Mediterranean region?
