9999/C Q999 E/087 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2400/03 by Avril Doyle (PPE-DE) to the Council (10 July 2003) Subject: Exemption from VAT on postage for charities Further to the Commission proposal to put VAT on postage and recognising that this would impose a severe financial burden on charities that depend on direct mail fundraising and are not eligible to reclaim VAT in the same way as ordinary businesses. Can the Council advise whether it will be possible for charities that have the specific difficulty of not being able to reclaim VAT under Irish tax law to secure an exemption from this EU legislation?
