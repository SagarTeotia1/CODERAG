WRITTEN QUESTION P-0621/10 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (5 February 2010) Subject: Possible application of Article 122, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union According to Article 122 (ex Article 100 TEC), paragraph 2, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, ‘Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences beyond its control, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may grant, under certain conditions, Union financial assistance to the Member State concerned. The President of the Council shall inform the European Parliament of the decision taken’. The above article refers to ‘exceptional occurrences’ beyond the control of a Member State and it is clear that the legislator used this non-specific wording precisely in order to allow decisions of an essentially political nature to be taken. Does the Commission intend to submit a proposal to the Council for financial assistance to be granted to Greece? If so, has the Commission sounded out the views of the Member States on this question? Has it drawn up conditions for the granting of this assistance? What procedure will be followed for taking the relevant decisions?
