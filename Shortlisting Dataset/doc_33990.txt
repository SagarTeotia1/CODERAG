Question for written answer P-8032/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Małgorzata Handzlik (PPE) (5 October 2010) Subject: Social assistance legislation and practices applied in Ireland The basis for the proper functioning of the internal market is the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital laid down in the Treaty. Free movement of persons means that citizens of any EU country taking up work in another EU country must be treated in the same way as citizens of that country without any discrimination whatsoever. The implementation of this freedom is guaranteed by, among other things, an obligation on Member States to ensure that citizens have equal access to social assistance. I am concerned to learn of the widespread refusal to grant social security benefits to Polish nationals living in Ireland on the grounds that they do not meet the condition of permanent residence in that country, even though any person staying in Ireland for more than 24 months automatically fulfils that condition. I fear that this practice could lead to a violation of the freedom of movement and discourage citizens of other Member States from settling in Ireland. Such practices are contrary to EU legislation. 1. Is the Commission aware of cases of discrimination against Polish nationals in Ireland through the refusal to grant the social assistance due to them? 2. What action does the Commission intend to take to stop such discriminatory practices?
