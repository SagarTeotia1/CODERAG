WRITTEN QUESTION E-6811/08 by Syed Kamall (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (19 December 2008) Subject: Stoning in Somalia A number of constituents have brought to my attention the stoning to death of a 13-year-old girl in Kismayo, Somalia. They were shocked and incredibly moved that a 13-year-old Somali rape victim, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was subsequently convicted of adultery and then stoned to death by 50 men, with over a thousand spectators. My constituents feel that this is absolutely horrific and barbaric. They feel distressed at the prospect of what she and her family must have gone through. They tell me that not only did the authorities fail to protect her and bring about justice concerning the gang-rape, but they again failed her when they did not prevent this unspeakable act of violence and cruelty from happening. Will the European Union investigate this further? What measures does the Commission intend to utilise to pressure the authorities in Somalia not to allow these kinds of senseless atrocities?
