Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (2 February 2009) The Commission has responded to the cholera crisis in Zimbabwe by deploying humanitarian funding aimed both at treating victims of the disease and at stemming its spread. There have been small epidemics of cholera, and other diarrhoeal diseases, in Zimbabwe for the past 18 months. The response to the epidemic had, for this reason, already been included in the Commission's 2008 ‘global plan’ for Zimbabwe which was adopted before the onset of the main cholera epidemic; by financing water, sanitation and hygiene interventions in most regions of Zimbabwe as well as the coordination of these sectors at national level. According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA), about 33 579 cholera cases, of which more than 1 671 fatalities, have been recorded in Zimbabwe from August to 31 December 2008. The Commission has concentrated its efforts in the three main areas of outbreak — Harare, Mudzi and Beitbridge, by providing approximately EUR 9 million to support UN agencies and other international non-governmental agencies to (1) deploy water, sanitation and hygiene emergency teams, (2) rehabilitate water points in health facilities, and (3) to set up and run cholera treatment centres. Since the beginning of 2008, the Commission has also been intervening through the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) for the purchase and distribution of a limited list of essential medicines and medical supplies with the aim of provisioning health centres at the most decentralised level. Concerning aid to Zimbabwe covering all sectors, the Commission in 2007 provided EUR 90.9 million in both humanitarian and essential development aid which was channelled through its international partners. The Commission is the main donor to the vulnerable populations of Zimbabwe having provided more than EUR 500 million in direct support to the population since 2002.
