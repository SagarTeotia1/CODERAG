WRITTEN QUESTION E-4429/07 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (18 September 2007) Subject: Reintroduction projects for necrophagous birds: costs The EU supports a good many projects in the Member States for maintaining bird populations, including reintroduction projects for certain species. Could the Commission provide me with an overview of projects for the benefit of the griffon vulture (Gyps Fulvus) and other necrophagous birds which have received EU support since 1979 or are currently receiving EU support? Could the Commission also inform me of how much money, in euros, the EU has spent on such support?
