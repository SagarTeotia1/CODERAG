WRITTEN QUESTION E-6567/09 by Takis Hadjigeorgiou (GUE/NGL) to the Council (6 January 2010) Subject: Adoption of plan to step up operations in Afghanistan At the last meeting of the European Council held on 29 and 30 October, the EU decided to step up its contribution to operations in Afghanistan. At the same time, however, the Council has failed to give any justification for the role of foreign armed forces in the country. What scenario is envisaged by the EU regarding full independence for Afghanistan? Is it adopting the correct course of action in taking upon itself the international role of the UN in sending military and police personnel to such a distant country? Does this policy not make the EU Member States a target for extremist organisations, thereby further undermining the security of their citizens?
