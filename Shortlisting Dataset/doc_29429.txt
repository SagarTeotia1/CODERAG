Question for written answer E-008611/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (29 September 2011) Subject: Sovereign debt rating The Circle of Economists, a group of 30 academics specialised in banking and business studies based in France, has expressed the view that the IMF alone should have the authority to issue sovereign debt ratings, arguing that ‘ratings agencies may legitimately express their opinion other than in the case of countries which are beneficiaries of IMF support programmes’. In the final statement emerging from its recent meeting, the group concluded that Europe ‘needs to lay down strict rules governing ratings agencies’ intervention on sovereign debt', further describing the markets as characterised by ‘imperfections’ linked to ‘information asymmetries’. Can the Commission state its opinion on the above?
