concept of gross national product (GNP) was replaced by gross national income (GNI) in the area of the EU budget as from the year 2002. In order to respect the conclusions of the 1999 Berlin European Council (see footnote 3) administrative expenditure is excluded from the budgetary balances published in the report on allocation of EU operating expenditure by Member State. Table 2 below presents the same balances as in table 1, but including also administrative expenditure in the Member States. It could be mentioned that the Commission’s proposal for a generalised mechanism for correcting budgetary imbalances The proposal itself (COM(2004) 501 final) as well as the full analysis of the operation of the own resources system (COM(2004) 505 final, Volume II) is available at the following address: http://europa.eu.int/comm/budget/furtherinfo/index_en.htm , like the current UK correction, is based on the definition used in table 2 below.
