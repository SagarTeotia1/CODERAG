Question for written answer E-000420/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (24 January 2012) Subject: Plant protection products On 31 October 2011, a written parliamentary question was submitted to the Commission (E‑009846/2011) regarding the need to adopt measures and controls to ensure that Turkish hazelnuts imported into European Union countries comply with Community phytosanitary legislation during the production phase. The Commission’s answer, dated 22 November 2011, recognises, with regard to the use of plant protection products, that growers outside the EU only have to comply with the rules and procedures authorising the use of plant protection products in their own country. With regard to imports, the Commission points out that hazelnuts from countries outside the EU must respect the maximum residue levels established/imposed in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Parliament, therefore, accepts that an essential instrument for ensuring free competition between Community growers and growers outside the EU is the fixing of the maximum residue level (MRL) for pesticides at a level that is in line with the European legislation that is also applicable to European growers. 1. Can the Commission indicate how many MRL controls were carried out in 2009 and 2010 at the different points at which hazelnuts from Turkey enter European Union territory? 2. Can the Commission indicate how many of these controls revealed the presence of Carbaryl, Methidathion or Azinphos-methyl, insecticides that are banned for European growers but authorised in Turkey?
