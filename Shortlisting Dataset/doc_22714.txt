Question for written answer E-011532/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Gilles Pargneaux (S&D) (8 December 2011) Subject: Distribution of batches of the anti-cancer drug Thiotepa that had passed their expiry date The German pharmaceutical company Riemser has decided to lodge a complaint before the Tribunale de Grande Instance de Paris (Paris Regional Court) against the French pharmaceutical company Genopharm for ‘forgery and use of forged documents, deception and falsification’. Riemser is accusing Genopharm of having deliberately marketed batches of Thiotepa, a potent drug used in the treatment of childhood cancer, that had passed their expiry date. According to the German pharmaceutical company, batches of Thiotepa for which the expiry date had passed were still being sold on the market in early 2011 even though the expiry date displayed was March 2009. The German pharmaceutical group claims that Genopharm had produced a certificate showing a false expiry date of August 2011. All treatments involving this drug may, therefore, be compromised, since Thiotepa loses much of its effectiveness after 18 months. This falsification was confirmed by AFSSAPS (French Agency for the Safety of Health Products) in June 2011, following an inspection of the Genopharm laboratories. However, the European health authorities have authorised the provision of Thiotepa in care facilities until 13 October 2011. — Can the Commission say why the European health authorities have not imposed immediate sanctions on the pharmaceutical company Genopharm? — Can the Commission also say what action it now intends to take against this pharmaceutical company, over and above the court proceedings brought in France?
