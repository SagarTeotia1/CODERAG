Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (13 October 2010) The EU Regulatory Framework is predicated on the principle of allowing competition to offer choice to consumers and to drive down prices. Regulation, in the form of ex ante measures, is only imposed where, owing to one or more market players having significant market power (or dominance) on a particular market, it is shown that there is a lack of effective competition on that market. A key part of making competition work for consumers is that they should be properly informed about the services provided to them, including the quality of such services. In addition to a number of provisions on transparency, including concerning the content of contracts between consumers and providers of a connection to a public communications network and/or publicly available electronic communications services, the EU regulatory framework also contains provisions on minimum service quality. Under Article 22(3) of Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive), OJ L 108, 24.4.2002. , as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 amending Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 337, 18.12.2009. , it is provided that ‘in order to prevent the degradation of service and the hindering or slowing down of traffic over networks, Member States shall ensure that national regulatory authorities are able to set minimum quality of service requirements on an undertaking or undertakings providing public communications networks’. With regard specifically to net neutrality, the Commission is currently conducting a public consultation on the open Internet and net neutrality in Europe, which closes on 30 September 2010. The issues which are the subject of the consultation include transparency and minimum quality of service.
