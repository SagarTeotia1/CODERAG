WRITTEN QUESTION E-3347/10 by Nessa Childers (S&D) to the Commission (12 May 2010) Subject: Safety procedures while playing indoor sports Following the tragic death of a young Irishman recently who banged his head while playing indoor soccer, I was shocked to hear the coroner say that there is no policy or practice anywhere governing safety of such activities.
