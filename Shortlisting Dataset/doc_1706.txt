Question for written answer E-001407/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (23 February 2011) Subject: Construction of a natural gas reservoir in Greece The Greek Ministry for Energy and the Environment is intending to construct an underground natural gas reservoir to the south of the city of Kavala. The expert committee set up to consider the need for the proposed reservoir and the possibilities for its construction has put forward three options in its conclusions: (a) constructing the underground reservoir as a public project and incorporating it into the national natural gas system (ESFA); (b) constructing the reservoir within the framework of a partnership agreement where the national natural gas network operator (DESFA) would hold a majority stake and incorporating it into the ESFA; and (c) constructing the reservoir using private capital and operating it as an independent natural gas system (ASFA). Bearing in mind the position taken by the Greek Competition Commission (EEA), which basically attributes the absence of fair competition conditions in the refinery sector to the legal regime governing the maintenance of security reserves and the impossibility for undertakings and large consumers to import supplies, and the EEA's Decision 418/V/2008, which stresses that, until storage sites are available on the market in sufficient number, the Competition Commission proposes creating a body responsible for managing security reserves following the model used in many European countries, can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Is it examining the Greek Government's intention to construct a natural gas reservoir? Can it guarantee that natural gas storage will not be affected by the same sort of monopoly as the oil sector? 2. With regard to the above decision by the Greek Competition Commission (418/V/2008), and particularly the removal of obstacles to competition on the refining market, what steps has the Greek Government taken? Does the Commission know whether Greece has launched procedures to amend the legislation governing security reserves, as proposed by the Greek Competition Commission?
