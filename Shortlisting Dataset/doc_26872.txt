time acquire the land; Emphasises that at this stage it seems evident that the Parliament can only obtain the long lease held by SCI Erasme; believes therefore that the final acquisition of the land will be the matter between the Parliament and the City of Strasbourg and, if necessary, with the French national authorities; 18. Recalls however that ECA has recently conducted an audit on the buildings policy; points out that in its opinion ECA has expressed the concerns as to the use of indexation rates used to calculate the total amount of the bi-annual rent; concludes further that the ECA made it clear the indexation could potentially be unfavourable to the European Parliament; 19. Notes that the facts established by the Working Group, on the basis of information made available to it, are the following: – The lease agreement by virtue of which the European Parliament leases the said two buildings involves a triangular relationship between, on the one part, the Parliament itself as the lessee of the WIC and SDM buildings, on the second part, the City of Strasbourg as the lessor and on the third part, SCI Erasme as the private investor and owner of the buildings; – there appear to be no indications that there have been unlawful actions in the process of concluding and applying the leases and additional agreements, although there are nevertheless doubts on whether the principle of “sound financial management” enshrined in the Financial Regulation has been fully respected; – there is no absolutely reliable basis for setting an appropriate rent for the WIC and SDM buildings once Parliament is the only potential client, as in Strasbourg; nor is a comparison with the cost of office space in various countries and cities adequate in this case; understandably, this made it difficult to establish a “fair price” for the rent in question and therefore to assess whether the Parliament had been paying a truly fair rent over the years; – a fundamental reason for the fact that rents have been rising for years is that, in 1985 the Parliament's decision-making bodies agreed to the City of Strasbourg's proposal to index-link the annual amounts, disregarding dissenting opinions delivered in 1980 by the Quaestors and the Committee on Budgets; – there is a considerable difference between, on the one hand, the rent it pays to the City of Strasbourg for use of the WIC and SDM Buildings and, on the other, the monthly repayments by the City of Strasbourg to the private investor: according to its Administration's calculations, the additional amounts paid over the 25 years of the lease, after deduction of the investment cost and the cost of works carried out, amount to at least EUR 32 m; at this point in time, pending further information from the City of Strasbourg and SCI Erasme, it cannot be ruled out that the additional payments might also total at least EUR 46 m (internal audit) or just under EUR 60 m (external audit); – not until March 2006 were there indications that its rental payments to the City
