creation of the Common Service for External Relations (SCR) constituted a failed attempt to rationalise the administration of Community aid and that the unclear distribution of responsibilities between various departments reduced its effectiveness; in this context highlights the need to integrate the whole cooperation cycle and is in favour of responsibility for the whole development cooperation cycle being assigned to one and the same body, with one Commissioner having political responsibility for it, namely the Commissioner responsible for development policy; believes that this would improve the efficiency of the Commission administration as well as the visibility of the Commission's action in this field, without affecting the distribution of responsibilities between Commissioners; 15. Upholds the specific identity of Community development policy and its added value, and strongly deplores the view, prevailing in a number of Member States, that development aid should be renationalised; believes strongly that the development policies of Member States should be complementary to and should not attempt to replace or duplicate Community development policy; in view of the importance which it attributes to public Community-level policy in the development sphere, also advocates that all programme management be concentrated in the Commission and the delegation of such activities to external agencies strictly limited; 16. Notes the plan to set up a new Community aid management body based on the SCR transformed into an Office, and considers that it must take a form compatible with the aims of greater effectiveness of Community aid; the form it takes must in any event ensure the unity of Community action and ensure that the Commission can control the body; to this extent the EP will maintain political control over its activities; 17. Considers, also, that the creation of this body must entail the simplification of management procedures, in particular as regards the cofinancing of projects with NGOs; 18. Expresses the conviction that the NGOs have the ability to implement programmes specifically targeted at combating poverty, and considers that the Commission must make greater use of this potential; 19. Considers that the EU should develop strategies to promote vibrant and strong civil societies in recipient countries; that the EU should seek to collaborate with civil society sectors, including NGOs and the private sector, in all areas of external cooperation, to realise development objectives, and that civil society organisations should be considered essential and independent partners of the EU who play a significant role in the development process; the EU should encourage greater policy dialogue with civil society and greater collaboration at a programme level; 20. Stresses the importance of a proper assessment of the impact of external aid programmes, so that the positive and negative lessons may have a bearing on the planning and implementation of subsequent measures; stresses the need to train staff specialised in this field and to give the evaluation unit the staff and powers needed to ensure that its work improves the impact and effectiveness of development aid policy; 21. With regard to comitology, agrees with the Commission that the role of the Council's working groups and committees needs to evolve so
