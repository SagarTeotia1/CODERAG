arrangements, but should lead to a comparable level of consumer protection in all the Member States. The choice of a mixed approach The European Parliament expresses its preference for the adoption of a mixed or combined approach, i.e. a horizontal instrument with the primary goal of ensuring the coherence of the existing legislation and enabling loopholes to be closed by grouping together, in consistent law, cross-cutting issues common to all the directives. The report considers that specific questions which are outside the scope of the horizontal instrument should continue to be considered separately in the sectoral directives.

They also want to establish a timetable for replacing the use of all primates in scientific experiments with alternatives. As of 6 September 2007, 433 MEPs had signed the written declaration. In order for a written declaration to be formally adopted by the European Parliament, more than half of its Members have to sign it. The declaration was sponsored by UK MEP John Bowis, French MEP Martine Roure, Swedish MEP Jens Holm, German MEP Rebecca Harms and Slovenian MEP Mojca Drcar Murko. Co-sponsor John Bowis (EPP-ED, UK) said: "This is great news for everyone who is interested in animal welfare, but also wants to protect human health. Currently around 3,300 primates are used in British laboratories each year. Alternative practices are increasingly being developed and applied, which mean that this number can be reduced with an eventual aim of a complete phase out of testing on primates. “I welcome efforts to reduce and replace the use primates used in test, but more action needs to be taken to achieve the end of testing on primates." “More than a quarter of primate species are in danger of extinction, yet wild-caught primates continue to be captured and taken from their natural habitat to be used for research in EU laboratories. "Advancements in technology has provided alternative 'test' methods that are proving to be more efficient and reliable than primate experiments and ending the use of monkeys and apes in scientific trials must now be a priority." David Martin (PES, UK) said: "Primates are so close to humans in their social, mental and emotional functions, that putting them through the extreme trauma of scientific testing should be unthinkable. Aside from this consideration scientific tests on primates are often bad science, and many of the species being used are endangered in the wild. For these reasons I have signed the
