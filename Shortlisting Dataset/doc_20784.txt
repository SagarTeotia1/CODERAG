Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (9 June 2011) As outlined in the Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) Energy Efficiency Plan 2011, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, COM(2011)109 final. , the Commission proposes a two-step approach to target setting. As a first stage, Member States are setting their national indicative 2020 energy efficiency targets and programmes. These are currently communicated by the Member States in the national reform programmes. As a second stage, the Commission will evaluate the progress made by the Member States and assess the likelihood that the overall EU energy efficiency objective of 20 % of primary energy savings in 2020 is achieved. If the Commission's assessment shows that the EU objective is unlikely to be met, it will propose legally binding national energy savings' targets for 2020. The phasing-out of inefficient products from the market is a key component of the EU energy efficiency policy. The Ecodesign Directive 2009/125/EC OJ L 285, 31.10.2009, p. 10. provides the framework for the setting of minimum efficiency requirements for energy-related products. In the last three years 12 implementing measures were adopted under this framework, addressing such products as lighting, electric motors, and televisions See the full list at: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/ecodesign/legislation_en.htm The Commission has committed in the Energy Efficiency Plan http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/action_plan/action_plan_en.htm to implement the current ecodesign working plan http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2008:0660:FIN:EN:PDF and adopt pending ecodesign Regulations for ‘heating boilers, water heaters, computers, air conditioners, tumble driers, pumps, vacuum cleaners and further types of lighting’. A complete list of products currently analysed in view of setting ecodesign requirements can be found on the website of the Energy Directorate-General (DG ENER) http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/studies/ecodesign_en.htm . A study has also been launched to define a new ecodesign working plan for 2012-14.
