WRITTEN QUESTION E-0098/05 by Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines (PPE-DE) and Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE) to the Council (18 January 2005) Subject: Anti-dumping measures to deal with hand pallet truck imports from China The versatility of hand pallet trucks means that they are used in many wholesale and retail sectors for all transportation of large bulk goods over short distances. Recently, a group of European manufacturers of hand pallet trucks, whose own data show that they represent 72% of Community production, has been prejudiced by the arrival from China of hand pallet trucks at unjustifiably low prices, which cause dumping. Data from major European producers indicate that in recent years these imports have caused major prejudice to the industry within the Community, inter alia a 30% fall in sales, the loss of a quarter of the total market quota, a drastic fall in profits and the closing down of companies, leading to the loss of 17% of jobs in the sector. The closure of companies and the loss of jobs in a sector with a high technical content are a step in the wrong direction on the way to achieving the major objectives set out in the Lisbon Strategy by the year 2010, namely the creation of quality jobs and economic growth based on knowledge and technology. Does the Council intend to impose anti-dumping tariffs on these imports? Will it take any other action or measures to combat unfair competition practices on the part of the Chinese exporters who are causing such damage to the European hand pallet truck sector?
