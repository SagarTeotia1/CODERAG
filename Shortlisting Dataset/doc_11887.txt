Question for written answer E-011471/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (8 December 2011) Subject: Effects on the health of the residents of the municipality of Fili resulting from the presence of a landfill site in the area For many years, a landfill site has been operating in the municipality of Fili where practically all the waste of Attica, which comprises 40 % of the waste produced by Greece, ends up. Moreover, the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate Change has recently approved the environmental conditions for two new large biological drying and mechanical recycling units with a total capacity of 4 000 tonnes/day which will operate in the same area http://static.diavgeia.gov.gr/doc/4%CE%919%CE%9E0-%CE%9B http://static.diavgeia.gov.gr/doc/4%CE%919%CE%9E0-%CE%A8 . Despite the Ministry’s announcements http://www.ypeka.gr/Default.aspx?tabid=389&sni[524]=1009&language=el-GR , no tests have, to date, been carried out on the polluted land for point sources of hazardous waste, for illegal dumping or to detect a large number of toxic substances (dioxins, heavy metals, etc.) that may be present in the environment (soil, water, air, etc.). Local citizens’ initiatives have protested to the municipality of Fili about far-reaching and serious public health issues Complaint/claim of Ch. Marmaros (Special Secretariat for the Environment and Energy Inspectorate (EGEPE) Protocol No 1543/8.6.2011). . To a request for an epidemiological morbidity study for the purpose of investigating a possible relationship between an increase in cases of cancer and the presence of the landfill site in the area, the Directorate of Public Health responsible at the Regional Unit of Western Attica replied that it was not in a position to conduct such a study Region of Attica, Directorate of Environmental Health and Health Inspection, 29/7/2011, Protocol No 3654. . Will the Commission say: 1. Whether it considers a study to detect polluted land and point sources of hazardous waste and on transporting illegal dumps to safe areas eligible for joint funding by the EU? 2. Whether it will be asking the Greek Government to carry out a morbidity study for the purpose of investigating a possible relationship between the increase in cases of cancer and the presence of the landfill site in the area? 3. What further action it intends to take along with the Greek authorities in order to safeguard citizens’ health?
