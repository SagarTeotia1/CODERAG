Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2010) The overwhelming majority of Member States have chosen to implement the Services Directive Directive 2006/123/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market, OJ L 376, 27.12.2006. by means of a horizontal framework law for services. From those, 12 Member States, i.e. Denmark, Romania, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Sweden, The Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Malta, Lithuania and Finland, have adopted their horizontal implementing legislation. To these Member States one has to add Germany and France which have chosen a different way of implementation, i.e. they will not adopt horizontal legislation but implement the directive through changes in existing legislation/sectoral changes. Many other Member States are expected to pass their horizontal legislation within the next three months, during the first half of 2010. Besides adopting horizontal laws, all Member States also need to make changes in existing laws. In the majority of Member States, changes to sectoral legislation have been adopted or are being discussed in their Parliaments. Of course, the situation in each Member State has to be carefully analysed, and the services of the Commission have started a detailed examination. This is, however, a very demanding task given the number of services concerned, the complexity of the questions involved and the amount of measures that have been or are still being notified by some Member States.
