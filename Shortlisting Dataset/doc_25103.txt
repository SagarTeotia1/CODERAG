Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (12 November 2007) On 31 December 2006 16.4 % of senior management posts were held by women. There was a female Secretary-General, one female Director-General and five female Deputy Directors-General. Women held 19.3 % of middle management posts (heads of unit). On 31 December 2006 there were five female Chefs de Cabinet, which was equivalent to 18.5 %. The total proportion of women in management (senior and middle management) was 18.7 % on 31 December 2006, compared with 37 % for women in category AD (excluding management posts) and 62.5 % for women in category AST. The Commission recognises the need for improvement and has consequently been pursuing a proactive policy in favour of equal opportunities for men and women within the institution for several years (see below). Since 1995 the Commission has been setting targets for the appointment and recruitment of women in category AD, particularly in management posts. In 2007 it decided to set these targets at 25 % for initial recruitment and appointment to senior management posts, 30 % for middle management and 50 % for recruitment to category AD (excluding management posts), in so far as the reserve lists allowed Memorandum to the Commission (SEC(2007)507/4 and /5) of 2 May 2007 on the targets for the recruitment and appointment of women to management and other AD posts in the Commission for the year 2007. . This policy, and the action programmes on equal opportunities adopted since 1988 (see below), have had a positive impact on female representation in category AD and particularly in management posts. Whereas in 1994 women accounted for just 2 % of senior management posts, 12 years later their proportion had risen to 16.4 %. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly at middle management level, where the Commission failed to meet its target two years running (in 2005 and 2006), largely because of the small number of female candidates for such posts. The Commission therefore decided to adopt binding measures in 2006, applicable from 2007 onwards, for appointments at middle management level Memorandum to the Commission (SEC(2006)1184/3) of 26 September 2006 on the second monitoring report on the fourth action programme for equal opportunities for women and men at the European Commission. . These measures include a written justification for the absence of women on a short-list if there were female candidates for the post, the compulsory representation of both sexes on every selection panel, the appointment of a special equal opportunities rapporteur on every selection panel, and the compulsory participation of all Commission managers in equal opportunities training by the end of 2009. An initial evaluation covering the three-month period from April to June 2007 reveals that in the 14 selection procedures examined seven women were appointed heads of unit. The fourth action programme for equal opportunities for women and men at the European Commission (2004‑08) was adopted on 28 April 2004 SEC(2004)447/5. and seeks primarily to improve the gender balance in the staff, remove the obstacles to career development for women
