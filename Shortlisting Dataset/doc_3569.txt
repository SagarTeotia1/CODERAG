and believes the Commission's paper does not pay enough attention to these areas. It urges the Member States to attract more young students into technical and scientific studies and it emphasises the " major potential of nano-sciences and nano-technologies ". Imports to be monitored more rigorously The Commission is urged to " focus on the area of market surveillance and the fight against unfair competition and counterfeiting ". MEPs also say it should " monitor and record the extent to which imported products comply with European environmental and consumer health protection legislation and affect the competitivity of European products ". EU manufacturing industry provides around 20% of EU output and employs some 34 million people. Over 80% of EU private sector R&D expenditure takes place in this industry. Manufacturing generates new and innovative products that provide some 75% of EU exports. Manufacturing has a high proportion of SMEs: they account for over 99% of companies and 58% of manufacturing employment.

Mr Lamassoure's report deals with a proposal for a Council Decision on the system of the European Communities’ own resources aiming at implementing the conclusions of the European Council of 15-16 December 2005 in the own resources area. The key amendment proposed deals with the implication of Parliament in the review set for 2008/09 which the Commission will present. This has been repeatedly flagged up in the past few months. This is motivated by the fact that Parliament, as yet, has no formal say in the review (it is entirely in the hands of Council). The main elements of the proposal in the aftermath of the December summit's conclusions are the following: - introduction of a fixed rate of call of VAT. The European Council concluded that the rate of call of VAT shall be fixed at 0.30 % of Member States’ capped VAT bases; - introduction of temporarily reduced rates of call of VAT for specific Member States; - introduction of temporary reductions in the GNI contributions for specific Member States. In the coming seven years, the Netherlands and Sweden will benefit from gross annual reductions in their GNI contributions of €605m and €150m respectively expressed in 2004 prices. These gross reductions will be financed by all Member States. -Adjustment of the UK correction to enlargement. The UK rebate shall remain in full except for enlargement-related expenditure. Expenditure in the new Member States, with the exception of CAP market expenditure, shall therefore be excluded from total allocated expenditure for the purpose of calculating the UK correction. This reduction
