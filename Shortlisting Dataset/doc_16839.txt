Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (21 December 2007) 1. In 2006-07, the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG) carried out an in-depth revision of the Greek national accounts, which led to a rise of 9.6 % in gross domestic product (GDP) for the base year 2000, instead of 25.7 % in the first revised evaluations submitted by NSSG. The increase of 9.6 % affects the whole period 1995‑2006. The work undertaken by the Greek national accountants follows the availability of new statistical data sources, in particular the census of the population, new structural surveys of companies in construction, hotels, cafes and restaurants and transport, as well as an update of the family budget survey. Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, conducted two missions to Greece in 2007 with the support of five experts delegated by Member States. Following these missions, the new figures for Greek GDP were recalculated by comparison with the first evaluations. The gap between these two estimates arises in particular from the outcome of a deeper assessment of the new data, related to the activities referred to above as well as of the way they were processed. This gap is explained less by a questioning of the sources of the data than by differences in their use in the process of drawing up the accounts. In particular, by improving the coherence between micro-economic and macroeconomic analysis when implementing the principle of reconciliation, which is one of the main characteristics of national accounting and which consists of comparing within a rigorous framework data obtained from independent sources in order to derive the estimates of GDP and its components. The gross national income (GNI) Committee, which includes experts from the Member States, followed all the work and, on the basis of the statistics available to date, expressed a favourable opinion during its meeting of 25 October 2007 on the figures presented by the NSSG benefiting from this more accurate analysis. These GDP figures are the following: Revised series for Greek GDP, million EUR 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 136281 147467 157586 171258 185225 198609 213985 2. The revision of the GDP has increased the size of the Greek economy without affecting its dynamics in a significant way. In other words, after the revision, GDP growth remains at 4 % on average in the period 2005‑07. Other things being equal, a higher GDP leads to a permanent reduction of GDP ratios (denominator effect). However, this is partially countered by the increase in Greece's contribution to the EU budget, resulting from the revision of the GNI. Consequently, the official deficit-to-GDP ratio and debt-to-GDP ratio targets of the 2008 budget, as submitted to the Greek parliament on the 20th November 2007, have been reduced from 1.7 % to 1.6 % and from 98.9 % to 91 % of the revised GDP respectively.
