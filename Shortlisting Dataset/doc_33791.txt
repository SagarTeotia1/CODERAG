2004/C 33 E/257 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2315/03 by Paul Rübig (PPE-DE) to the Commission (14 July 2003) Subject: Restriction of market access of plasma-derived medicinal products in Australia In Australia, a monopoly arrangement (The Plasma Fractionation Agreement) allows CSL Limited to be the sole supplier of Australian plasma-derived medicinal products. This is despite that fact that CSL Limited enjoys the same freedom of trade as European manufacturers in the European Union and in other major markets. The safety standards under which plasma-derived medicinal products are being manufactured and distributed do not differ between CSL Limited and other major manufacturers whose products are being restricted from the Australian market. Indeed, another severe discrimination exists in the fact that plasma-derived medicinal products originating from non-Australian sources have to demonstrate improvements in terms of efficacy and safety to gain market access. Does the Commission not agree that such a policy is a severe barrier to trade and market access by discriminating against products that are being manufactured following state-of-the-art technology and authorised to the market in Member States of the European Union? And does the Commission not agree that this issue should be raised and discussed at the next WTO round in Cancun in October 2003?
