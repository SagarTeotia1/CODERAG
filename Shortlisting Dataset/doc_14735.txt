Question for written answer E-002823/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Stephen Hughes (S&D) (13 March 2012) Subject: EU Directive 2003/59/EC EU Directive 2003/59/EC requires bus and lorry drivers to take 35 hours of training every five years. This training is made up of modules, most of which can be chosen by the driver/haulier. There is a module which raises awareness of vulnerable road users. In light of calls by EU citizens to make cycling safer throughout the European Union, could the module which raises awareness of vulnerable road users, such as cyclists, be made compulsory?
