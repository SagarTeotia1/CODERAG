Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2012) Regarding e-government services to citizens in Greece, operations are co-financed by the specific thematic programmes for Digital Convergence and Administrative Reform. The Digital Convergence programme covers, amongst others, the issue of electronic services to citizens within the eight Greek Convergence regions. It operates together with and on behalf of the transition regions (phasing-in and phasing-out). In total, the approved operations for electronic services to citizens (including the sectors of culture and tertiary education) within the cohesion policy programmes amount to EUR 616 million; the contracted operations amount to EUR 97 million with expenditure so far of EUR 58 million. The Administrative Reform programme deals with reforms in central government and also supports reforms in local and regional governments, mainly in the context of the first and second Stability and Growth Programmes (MoU). Examples of operations include the ‘Units for Planning and Budgeting’ in every ministry, the ‘Standardisation of the implementing procedures of the New Civil Servants’ Code’, the reforms regarding the ‘Tax administration and Tax collection’ and the ‘Reorganisation of the General Accounting Office of Greece’. The programme amounts to EUR 594 million and the contracted operations amount to EUR 108 million with expenditure of EUR 58 million. A list of operations supported thus far by these programmes is available upon request from the managing authorities: Digital Convergence Lekkas 23-25 105-62 Athens Administrative Reform Menaixmou & Theofilopoulou 18 117-43 Athens
