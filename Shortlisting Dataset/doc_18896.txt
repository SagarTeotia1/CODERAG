Question for written answer E-011994/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (16 December 2011) Subject: Combating illegal online activities In recent years, the European Union has been actively seeking to combat cybercrime, illegal downloading and the publication of illegal content. It is, however, important to find a fair balance between protecting intellectual property rights and protecting the privacy and fundamental rights of users. The Court of Justice of the European Union recently issued a judgment on this matter in which it stated that one of the recording industry's measures against illegal file sharing is in violation of fundamental rights. It concluded that EC law prohibits national courts from requiring Internet service providers to install filtering systems to prevent the illegal downloading of files, since such systems would not necessarily be able to distinguish adequately between legal and illegal content and would, therefore, constitute a threat to the free access to information. What is the Commission's view on the statements of the Court of Justice in the context of the Anti‑Counterfeiting Trade Agreement?
