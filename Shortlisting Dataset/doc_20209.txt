WRITTEN QUESTION E-4841/08 by Anni Podimata (PSE) to the Commission (10 September 2008) Subject: Energy poverty According to statistics from various European studies, southern Europe is affected to a greater extent by ‘energy poverty’ (between 11 and 44 % of households). A study conducted by the Physics Department of the University of Athens (November 2006) concluded that there is a social dimension to this phenomenon in that the least well-off sections of the population end up bearing the high costs of energy caused by increased oil prices and other factors, because housing conditions are directly linked to income (the lower the income, the less energy-efficient the housing). Bearing in mind that the buildings sector is one of the highest consumers of energy and that, although energy is an essential human need, more and more consumers are unable to meet their bills: 1. Will the Commission take firm measures to combat energy poverty and protect vulnerable consumers, and 2. Will it propose the setting up of a special fund to help the low-paid to modernise their homes and make them more energy-efficient (buildings insulation, for example)?
