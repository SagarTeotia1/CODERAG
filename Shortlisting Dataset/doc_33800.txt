WRITTEN QUESTION E-4181/05 by Glyn Ford (PSE) to the Commission (16 November 2005) Subject: Reconstruction in Iraq Many minorities feel that reconstruction aid in Iraq is going to the ruling Kurd and Shiite leaders at the expense of many others. The Assyrians in the Nineveh plains have received little or no help. Recent UN investigations estimated USD 500 million going missing with allegations of theft by the previous Iraqi ministers; there is certainly the money available to fund a full reconstruction. Will the Commission investigate these allegations and also endeavour to ensure that EU funds are distributed fairly?
