Answer given by High Representative/Vice President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (18 May 2011) The Commission is aware of the case of Mr Hassan Mohammed Hassan al-Hammadi and agrees that this is a worrying case. The EU is paying great attention to human rights and fundamental freedoms in UAE and in the other Gulf countries, both generally and especially against the background of the recent unrest in the region. There is currently no bilateral agreement between the EU and the UAE and thus no institutional bilateral political dialogue with the country. The interaction takes place at regional level with the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the UAE is a member and with which the EU maintains regular political dialogue including on human rights. In addition, the EU brings up human rights issues in bilateral meetings with the country as well as through other diplomatic means. These matters were discussed at the meeting of EU‑GCC Regional Directors (political dialogue) that took place in Brussels on 5 April 2011 and were on the agenda of the EU‑GCC annual Ministerial Meeting, held in Abu Dhabi on 20 April 2011. The necessity of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and to implement political reforms based on inclusive dialogues in the Gulf countries was also raised several times during the trip undertaken by HRVP Ashton to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE from 17 to 20 April 2011.
