stop. MEPs also make a list of recommendations to Parliament's Bureau. They deplore the lack of clarity regarding social security obligations of parliamentary assistants. They also say it is unacceptable that smoking is allowed in Parliament's offices. They therefore demand " urgent action to reduce the level of smoke on its premises " and urge the College of Quaestors " to designate a clearly defined and well-ventilated smoking area ".
