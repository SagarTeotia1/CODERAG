Liberal-Democrat group, was sceptical about whether the recent summit was a turning point of the crisis in Europe. "Do you really believe that the fiscal compact will put an end to the mess," he said. Mr Verhofstadt also criticised European Central Bank president Mario Draghi for "printing new money", which he described as an "insufficient solution to the crisis" and called for a redemption fund mutualising debt over 60% of GDP, which he considered as the only true long-term measure to stabilise the economy. Combating tax evasion and tax havens by forcing banks to declare all deposits by EU citizens if they are to operate in the EU, as the US has done, was proposed by the French Green co-chair Daniel Cohn-Bendit . He also called for a "triple golden rule" in the EU that will cover not only budgetary discipline but will also be "a social and environmental golden rule". Martin Callanan , the British chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, disputed that the worst of the crisis was over. "Europe is not ok, the economic weakness is the problem and the new (fiscal) treaty is simply irrelevant." He also talked of a "collapse in living standards and levels of unemployment unseen in Europe since the 1930s. Measures are required so that Greece can organise an orderly default and leave the euro." Paul Murphy, Irish member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, said: "Trying to meet fiscal deficit targets means €5.7 billion in extra cuts and taxes in Ireland and more than ten billion across the euro zone. It doesn’t mean growth, it means more unemployed, more crisis, worse public services and worse work conditions." Nigel Farage, co-chair of the Europe of the freedom and democracy Group, said he was shocked by talk about how positive the last Council meeting was. "You are determined but delusional, to keep the euro propped up". When commenting on Greece and talk of a potential third bailout, he said: "It is going to crucify Greece." 20120309STO40294 Feature on plenary week Video of the debate Summit website plus conclusions EN 1 PHOTO 20120313PHT40610.jpg EN 3 LINK /ep-live/en/plenary/search-by-date?start-date=20120313&end-date=20120314&date=20120313&format=wmv&askedDiscussionNumber=0 EN 4 LINK http://www.european-council.europa.eu/council-meetings.aspx?lang=en -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20120302FCS39886 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN
