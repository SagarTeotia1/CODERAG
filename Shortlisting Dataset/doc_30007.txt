Question for written answer E-010721/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Françoise Castex (S&D) (21 November 2011) Subject: Collection and sorting of bulky waste and services of general economic interest The authorities of one particular conurbation are envisaging the possibility of entrusting the public collection and sorting of bulky waste to a service provider, possibly a cooperative undertaking (‘société coopérative d'intérêt collectif’ — SCIC). Pending the entry into force in 2012 of new rules governing services of general economic interest: 1. Does the Commission consider that the collection and sorting of bulky waste could be classified as a service of general economic interest? Do such services exist for the purpose of waste management? 2. Is it admissible for the conurbation in question to help set up an SCIC cooperative, hold shares in it, participate in the management thereof and award it contracts to provide a service of general economic interest without organising a competitive tendering procedure? 3. Have any thresholds been established making it possible to detect overpayments?
