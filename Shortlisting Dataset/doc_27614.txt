WRITTEN QUESTION E-3864/05 by Ioannis Gklavakis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 October 2005) Subject: Health checks on imported fish Ten tonnes of fish imported from Brazil were recently impounded in Greece. The fish concerned were red porgy, the mercury content of which exceeded the maximum authorised. In the light of this incident, will the Commission say: 1. whether the health checks carried out in third countries are harmonised with EU checks and who guarantees that the health certificate which accompanies imported fish complies with the rules applying within the Community; and 2. what guarantees there are, where there are suspected or verified cases of disease in the waters of third countries, that the criteria for designating an area as ‘contaminated’, and for maintaining or withdrawing that description, suffice to enable fish or aquaculture products to be imported into Member States of the EU?
