ORAL QUESTION H-0183/05 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by María Valenciano Martínez-Orozco to the Council Subject: Urgent condemnation of the violent repression by the police of a demonstration by women in Turkey The violent repression by the police of a group of women who were demonstrating last Sunday to mark International Women’s Day and calling, among other legitimate rights, for equal pay for women in Istanbul, deserves the European Union’s firm and unequivocal condemnation. The Turkish Government should, as a matter of urgency, answer for the beating the women received from the police, but even more it should bear in mind that equality between men and women is a fundamental EU principle that must be protected and respected in all circumstances. Turkey should show it is willing and the Council should make the Turkish authorities aware of the essential need to acknowledge fundamental rights and prevent further repressive action by a male-dominated society, if it wishes to become a member of the European family. Does the Council intend to demand inclusion and application of the gender perspective, as well as human rights, in all the areas covered by the negotiations with Turkey?
