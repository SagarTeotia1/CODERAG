ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0117/05 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Edward McMillan-Scott , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to the Commission Subject: EU support for the process of political reform in Egypt The process of political reform which the Egyptian authorities have undertaken to pursue is very important. However, given the shortcomings reported by its ad hoc delegation and Egyptian NGOs, does the Commission feel that the recent legislative elections in Egypt constitute an adequate basis for the EU to sign an Action Plan and that the EU institutions should offer their political commitment, financial support and technical assistance to the Egyptian authorities and Parliament with a view to bringing the infrastructure and functioning of the electoral mechanisms up to international standards?
