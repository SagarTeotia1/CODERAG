WRITTEN QUESTION E-2140/06 by Charles Tannock (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (17 May 2006) Subject: Attacks on Egyptian Coptic Christians The recent deadly attacks on churches in Alexandria, Egypt have left the ancient Coptic minority community in grief. Islamic extremists attacked Christians attending the Friday service on 14 April 2006 at three different Coptic Orthodox churches, killing one and injuring at least 17 other Christians. A fourth attempt reportedly occurred at another church in the city. These attacks are an escalation of continuous similar attacks and hate crimes over the past year, some as recent as January 2006, in which a murder of a Christian man in Upper Egypt was carried out. Attacks on the Christian faith are also increasing in the Egyptian media. The escalating violence against and oppression of Coptic Christians in Egypt is deeply alarming and associated with rising Islamic radical terrorist violence in the country. In the past extremists responsible for these heinous actions in Egypt have never been caught and/or brought to justice for their crimes. The unwillingness of the Egyptian authorities to convict and punish those responsible goes hand-in-hand with their failure to bring to justice those responsible for the massacre of 21 Christians in El‑Kosheh in January 2000. Can the Commission please bring this matter to the urgent attention of the Egyptian authorities and demand that they investigate and apprehend those responsible?
