WRITTEN QUESTION E-1389/06 by Gay Mitchell (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (5 April 2006) Subject: Trafficking and prostitution of women during the World Cup With 3 million fans expected to attend the World Cup tournament in Germany in June of this year, all estimates point to a dramatic increase in prostitution and trafficked human beings in the 12 hosting cities concerned. Will the Commission ensure that the issue of trafficking and prostitution is put as a matter of urgency on the agenda of the meeting of the Ministers for Justice at the end of April? What efforts will the Commission make in advance of this event to curb both the trafficking and prostitution of women?
