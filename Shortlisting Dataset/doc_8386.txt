Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2012) The enforcement of the directive on the protection of pigs Council Directive 2008/120/EC of 18 December 2008 laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs, OJ L 47, 18.2.2009. is a priority for the Commission. For several years, the Commission inspection service (FVO — Food and Veterinary Office) has been carrying out on-the-spot audits in Member States to assess their systems of controls of EU welfare legislation in pig farms. In particular, they assess the application of the requirement to keep sows and gilts in groups from four weeks after service to one week before the expected date of farrowing as this already applies to new pig holdings since 1 January 2003 in EU15 Member States or the date of accession in EU12 Member States. In July 2011, the Commission requested data from Member States on the current state of play on the implementation of group housing as well as their predictions for 31 December 2012 and their national action plans to address the situation. The Commission subsequently sent a further official request to Member States to provide or complete the data already provided by 30 January 2012. At this stage, the Commission intends to monitor closely the situation throughout 2012 and to work with Member States and stakeholders to achieve compliance by 1 January 2013. FVO missions to verify the implementation of group housing of sows will be conducted in 2013 when Member States will have the legal obligation to ensure that this requirement is applied in all pig holdings keeping 10 sows or more.
