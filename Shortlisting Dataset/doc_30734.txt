WRITTEN QUESTION E-0092/07 by Frank Vanhecke (ITS) to the Commission (19 January 2007) Subject: ‘Green card’ for highly skilled immigrants On 9 January 2007, a spokesman for Mr Franco Frattini, Commissioner for freedom and justice, said that the Commission wished to introduce a ‘green card’ valid throughout the European Union. Once an immigrant had been admitted to an EU Member State as a highly skilled worker, he or she would also be able to work in other EU countries. In September 2007, final proposals will be submitted (‘Brussel wil green card voor hoogopgeleide immigranten’, De Telegraaf , 9 January 2007). For how many years would the ‘green card’ be issued? Would measures be taken to ensure that highly skilled immigrants from poorer countries had to leave the European Union after a number of years and return to their country of birth in order to assist its development?
