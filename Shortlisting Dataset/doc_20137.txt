Question for written answer E-002783/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Juan Fernando López Aguilar (S&D) (12 March 2012) Subject: Proper implementation of the EU-Morocco Agricultural Agreement On 16 February 2012, Parliament ratified the EU-Morocco Agreement concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products and fishery products. Ever since the beginning of the parliamentary process, and throughout the negotiations, the Commission has been informed of our concern about defects in the operation of the entry-price system rules and the need to amend these to ensure the Agreement is properly implemented and the specific customs duties paid. The Commission has announced that changes will be made to the aforementioned rules through the forthcoming CAP reform. Given that, at best, this reform will not come into force until January 2014, how does the Commission intend to control the entry price referred to in the Agreement before that date and also to check that the quotas provided for therein are correctly applied? Does the Commission intend to increase the number of inspections to verify that horticultural products imported under the Agreement have a reliable tracking system and meet the plant health requirements imposed on EU produce?
