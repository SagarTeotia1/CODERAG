1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community OJ L 149, 5.7.1971 , p. 2. Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1992/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 392, 30.12.2006, p. 1) . and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 OJ L 74, 27.3.1972 , p. 1. Regulation as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 311/2007 (OJ L 82, 23.3.2007, p. 6 ). of 21 March 1972 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and, in particular, the rules applicable to aggregation do not relate to supplementary pension schemes, except for schemes covered by the term "legislation", as defined in the first paragraph of Article 1(j) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, or which have been the subject of a declaration by a Member State pursuant to that provision . Supplementary pension schemes should therefore be the subject of specific measures in order to take account of their nature and specific characteristics and of the diverse nature of these schemes within the Member States and from one Member State to another, and in particular the role played by the social partners in their implementation. (4) Council Directive 98/49/EC of 29 June 1998 on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the Community OJ L 209, 25.7.1998 , p. 46. represents an initial specific measure designed to improve the exercise of the right of employed and self-employed persons to freedom of movement as regards supplementary pension schemes. (5) Recourse should also be had to Article 94 of the Treaty, given that the disparities between the national legislation governing supplementary pension schemes are likely to hamper both the exercise of the right of workers to freedom of movement and the operation of the internal market. Thus, in order to improve the rights of workers moving within the Community and within the same Member State, provision should be made for certain minimum requirements for the establishment and preservation of the vested pension rights of outgoing workers in a supplementary pension scheme linked to an employment relationship . (6) Moreover, account should be taken of the characteristics and special nature of supplementary pension schemes and the way they differ within and among the Member States. The introduction of new schemes, the sustainability of existing schemes and the expectations and rights of current pension scheme members should be adequately protected. This Directive should also take particular account of the role of the social partners in designing and implementing supplementary pension schemes. (7) This Directive should not require Member States that have no supplementary pension schemes to adopt legislation to introduce such schemes. (8) This Directive should apply only to supplementary pensions which, according to the rules of the relevant pension scheme or national law, are based on reaching retirement age or fulfilling other conditions. It should apply neither to individual pension arrangements with no employer participation nor to invalidity or survivors" pensions. (9)
