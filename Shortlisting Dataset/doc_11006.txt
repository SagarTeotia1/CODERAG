Question for written answer E-010712/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (20 December 2010) Subject: Estimated cost of EEAS cars The estimated cost for the purchase of 150 official, armour-plated cars for the European External Action Service (EEAS) is EUR 38 million. 1. Would the Commission not agree that this estimated expenditure, which amounts to some EUR 250 000 for each armoured car, is exorbitant? 2. Would it not agree that the considerable cost of hiring new staff and renting a new building, together with the EUR 75 million that it will cost to set up the new service, is at odds with the commitment made by the EU to take a cost-conscious approach to the new service?
