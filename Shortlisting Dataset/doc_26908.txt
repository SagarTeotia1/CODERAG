Considers that a constructive long-term neighbourhood policy is of vital importance for the partnership countries in order to promote progress towards peace, democracy, stability and prosperity, but also strategically important for the European Union considering the importance of the partner countries in the East as well as the South for our common security, environment and economic development; 2. Stresses that the review of the ENP must develop a well-structured and long-term, forward-looking ENI instrument, especially in a constrained budgetary environment, in order to avoid exaggerated fluctuations of financing and any potential overlapping with existing instruments; regrets, in that regard, the conclusion of the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June 2011 that ‘significantly increased financial support [...] will be decided [...] without prejudice notably to the MFF’; 3. Calls, in the light of the Arab Spring as well as the retreat from democracy in some of the Eastern partnership countries, for a specific self-critical evaluation of the financial instruments used in the past within the ENPI, with regard to their functioning in the fields of democracy, human rights, governance, fighting corruption, institution-building and support to civil society; believes that the EU must assume a newer approach enhancing cooperation for conflict prevention; 4. Considers that the review of the ENI must be consistent with, and be conducted in the context of, the current evaluation of the 2007-2013 MFF and the negotiations on the post-2013 period, with the aim of not reopening negotiations on the financing of neighbourhood policy during 2012 and 2013; 5. Considers that financial assistance under the neighbourhood policy must also take into account immigration and asylum and should support actions in order to mitigate the brain drain, promote information campaigns on the possibilities for legal migration, give structural help for reception of asylum-seekers and refugees, promote training of third countries’ officials in the field of asylum and human rights and facilitate reintegration of returnees; considers it necessary that the revised ENI does not neglect this dimension and is able to swiftly support and work in coherence with other financial instruments related to refugees, such as the European Refugee Fund, the European Return Fund and the External Borders Fund; 6. Agrees on the necessary improved interaction between the ENI and other instruments such as the EIB and EBRD to maximise EU added value, avoid duplication of efforts and resources and optimise the impact of assistance; believes in this regard that a comprehensive framework for this interaction should be considered; 7. Is of the firm conviction that financial assistance to the Palestinian
