Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (23 March 2010) Article 24(3) of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) (Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund, OJ L 223, 15.8.2006. ) excludes indeed compensation for the recurrent seasonal suspension of fishing activities. Such support would counteract the objectives of the EFF to adjust fishing capacity to fishing opportunities as it would provide incentives to maintain fishing capacity for fleet segments which are clearly not profitable in the mid‑ and long-term. The Commission considers that those rules should stay in force, but would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to other support measures available under the European Fisheries Fund, which would be suitable in the situation referred to such as socioeconomic measures in the form of retraining schemes, early retirement, diversification measures or public aid for the permanent cessation of fishing activities. With regard to the latter, it should be noted that the Portuguese authorities had proposed to boat owners involved in dredge fishing in the Algarve to reduce on a voluntary basis their overcapacity via a Fleet Adaptation Scheme with public support in the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 744/2008 instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Community fishing fleets affected by the economic crisis Council Regulation (EC) No 744/2008 of 24 July 2008 instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Community fishing fleets affected by the economic crisis, OJ L 202, 31.7.2008. . Unfortunately, this opportunity was not of sufficient interest to the Portuguese fishing industry and could thus not be implemented by the Portuguese authorities.
