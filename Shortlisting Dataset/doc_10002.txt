Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (1 August 2006) Since the creation of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) in 1997, the President of the Commission has been authorised by the Commission to appoint the EGE members. Commission Decision 2005/383/EC of 11 May 2005 on the renewal of the mandate of the EGE OJ L 127, 20.5.2005. has formalised this situation. On 19 October 2005, Mr Carlo Casini was appointed as a member of the EGE following Commission Decision 2005/754/EC OJ L 284, 27.10.2005. of 19 October 2005 on the appointment of the members of the EGE for its third mandate and in accordance with the previsions stated in Commission Decision 2005/383/EC. Since 8 May 2006, however, Mr Casini has been appointed as a member of Parliament. The Commission considers that this new appointment may contravene the missions entrusted to the EGE in Article 2 of Commission Decision 2005/383/EC Article 2: The task of the EGE shall be to advise the Commission on ethical questions relating to sciences and new technologies, either at the request of the Commission or on its own initiative. Parliament and the Council may draw the Commission's attention to questions which they consider to be of major ethical importance. and create some potential conflict of interest. Mr Carlo Casini will leave the EGE to honour his tasks at Parliament.
