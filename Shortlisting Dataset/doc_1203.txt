WRITTEN QUESTION E-0707/07 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (16 February 2007) Subject: Working Time Directive and Ireland In its 2000 report (COM(2000)787 final) on the state of implementation of Council Directive 93/104/EC OJ L 307, 13.12.1993, p. 18 . concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, the Commission notes on p. 24 of the English version that there are no specific arrangements under Irish law transposing the directive for informing the authorities about the regular use of night workers, as required by Article 11. Has the Commission since raised this matter with the Irish authorities and if so what has been their response? Does the Commission believe that the Irish legislation transposing the directive still needs to be amended in order to address this point?
