Question for written answer E-010234/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Robert Sturdy (ECR) (10 November 2011) Subject: Theft of trade secrets The European Union is a world leader in the fields of innovation and research and development. However, Europe’s competitive advantage in these areas is being undermined by the growing trend of the theft of trade secrets. Please can the Commission indicate whether or not it is aware of the problem, and detail what it is doing to assess the true scale of this problem? Furthermore, as trade secrets and intellectual property rights are protected by the World Trade Organisation and the TRIPS agreement, and in domestic legislation in a number of states around the world, including the US and Japan, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure EU trade secrets are protected?
