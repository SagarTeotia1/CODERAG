Question for written answer E-4702/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (25 June 2010) Subject: Hazardous waste In Portugal, in a densely populated region (S. Pedro da Cova, in the municipality of Gondomar), a number of public companies decided to dump, between May 2001 and March 2002, without any previous treatment or care, 320 000 tonnes of highly hazardous waste from the former national steelworks ( Siderurgia Nacional ). This waste contains very high levels of lead (between 3 700 and 24 000 mg/kg), zinc (between 21 000 and 129 000 mg/kg), cadmium (between 12.3 and 430 mg/kg), chromium (between 790 and 2 100 mg/kg), arsenic (between 31 and 99 mg/kg) and nickel and other heavy metals. Dumping this waste contaminated the soil and water and violated the law. These are substances which, as scientific studies have shown, are potentially carcinogenic, and may cause cognitive disabilities, damage the nervous system, cause progressive and irreversible kidney disease, affect enzymatic reactions or harm the reproductive system and the development of foetuses. Although they are known to be hazardous substances, they were simply dumped as if they were inert matter. I alerted the Portuguese Government to this state of affairs in a submission to the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal on 15 May 2009. However, it failed to take any action to assess the present situation or prevent possible increased damage to public health and failed to inform the public of the situation. This state of affairs is in clear breach of Community legislation, in particular Article 191 of the EC Treaty, ex-Article 174 TEC, the directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of the natural environment and domestic Portuguese legislation. A Portuguese TV report (on TV1) broadcast on 7 June called the above a crime against the environment and claimed there was evidence of tax fraud, money laundering and bribery of elected politicians and public sector managers. In view of the above, will the Council: 1. Determine the real situation on the ground as regards the illegal dumping of 320 000 tonnes of highly hazardous waste? 2. Demand that the Portuguese Government apply all existing EU legislation on protection of the environment and public health protection?
