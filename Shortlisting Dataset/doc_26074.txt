WRITTEN QUESTION E-4411/08 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) and Åsa Westlund (PSE) to the Commission (4 August 2008) Subject: Environmental data on pharmaceuticals The Commission is currently working on a legal proposal for patient information on pharmaceuticals, in accordance with Directive 2004/27/EC OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 34. (amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use), Article 88a. This article gives the Commission the task to ‘put forward proposals setting out an information strategy to ensure good-quality, objective, reliable and non-promotional information on medicinal products’. In Directive 2004/27/EC the Parliament initiated inclusion of several paragraphs (Recital 18, Article 1/27, Article 8/3ca and g, Article 127b) to protect the environment from pollution with pharmaceutical residues. In accordance with these amendments, aimed at protecting the environment, it seems appropriate to include environmental information on pharmaceuticals also in the forthcoming legal proposal on patient information on pharmaceuticals. Such information would assist patients and healthcare staff to manage handling of pharmaceuticals in a more environmentally cautious manner. The Commission has supported research on the environmental effect of pharmaceuticals in the last framework programmes in projects like Rempharmawater, Evramis, Poseidon, ERAPharm and Knappe. Furthermore, EMEA (the European Medicines Evaluation Agency) is currently considering inclusion of environmental information on pharmaceuticals in the public assessment report (EPAR). Will the Commission include environmental data on pharmaceuticals in the legal proposal on patient information on pharmaceuticals, as it would be in harmony with the other Commission actions in this field?
