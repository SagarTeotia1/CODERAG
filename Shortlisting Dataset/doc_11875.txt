WRITTEN QUESTION E-6006/09 by Martin Ehrenhauser (NI) to the Commission (30 November 2009) Subject: Website user question: freedom of access to universities This is an Internet community question submitted via the website www.ehrenhauser.at under the username ‘Unsereuni’. In early 2000, with the adoption of the Lisbon Strategy, the Council committed itself to a programme designed to make the EU the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy within 10 years, i.e. by 2010. In 2005, under the slogan ‘Knowledge for Growth’, Commissioner Janez Potočnik called for a pact to strengthen the ‘knowledge triangle’ in Europe (education, research and innovation). 1. Is promoting education, knowledge, research and innovation still a priority for the Commission? 2. Does the Commission consider that these objectives are furthered by affording maximum freedom of access to universities (i.e. no tuition fees, a well-developed grants system, a high proportion of public funding and no special admission procedures)? 3. If the Lisbon Strategy objectives are to be realised, what percentage of GDP should the Member States be spending on education, knowledge and research? 4. What percentage of GDP was spent in those areas in the years 2000-2009? 5. Will the EU realise the Lisbon Strategy objectives by 2010?
