on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation on the coordination of social security systems (15577/6/2003 – C5-0043/2004 – 1998/0360(COD)) Doc.: A5-0234/2004 Procedure : Codecision (2nd reading) Debate : 19.04.2004 Vote: 20.04.2004 Vote MEPs adopted a legislative resolution on social security systems. The Council had already taken account of a number of Parliament's first reading amendments, and this time House adopted just two further amendments, which are both acceptable to the Council. This highly complex piece of legislation, on which the Council must decide unanimously, will now finally be adopted in time for EU enlargement on 1 May 2004. Adoption of the regulation should make it easier for EU citizens to exercise their right to free movement within the EU. Coordination not harmonisation Community legislation on social security is one of the essential foundations of free movement of people within the EU. The present regulation in this field dates from 1971, and had the aim of guaranteeing that someone moving to another Member State is not put at a disadvantage compared with someone who stays put. This is achieved by ensuring that changing country does not mean the loss of established social security rights, and by avoiding the situation of people having to contribute to more than one social security system at the same time. The regulation makes no attempt to harmonise the Member States' social security systems, which vary a great deal from one country to another - rather, it aims to coordinate the cross-border aspects of the different systems. The original regulation has been altered, improved and extended many times over the years, and has become extremely complex and hard to follow. The Council's common position aims to simplify and modernise this legislation. The new regulation should apply to everyone covered by social security legislation, which represents a widening of scope compared with the present rules. Other important changes include extending the rules to cover early retirement schemes and modernising aspects concerning unemployment, cross-border workers and medical treatment. Before the changes can enter force, the Commission needs to propose details for three technical annexes and for revised implementing rules. The Commission has announced that it intends to make these proposals during 2004. They will be discussed during the next parliamentary term, under the codecision procedure. The whole package should enter force before 2006.
