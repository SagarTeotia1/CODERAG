Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2011) The Commission has been informed by OLAF that its investigation relating to the use of ERDF funds at the ‘Land van Ooit Tongeren’ project in Belgium (Region of Flanders) was finalised in October 2011. Based on its findings, OLAF concluded that financial follow-up by the Commission was needed, as well as possible judicial follow-up by the Belgian Judicial Authorities. Accordingly, OLAF's case report has been passed on to the competent service of the Commission for financial follow-up and to the Belgian federal prosecutor for consideration of the judicial aspects of the case. The Commission has taken measures to initiate the financial follow-up procedures. However, as the financial and judicial follows-up are not completed, the Commission and OLAF cannot comment on the substance of the file. OLAF’s investigation reports are subject to confidentiality and data protection and are not made accessible to the public. Should the discharge authority consider the need to receive access to the report or to consult it, such a request should be dealt in conformity with the relevant provision of the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission concerning access to confidential information required for the exercise of Parliament's prerogatives and competences.
