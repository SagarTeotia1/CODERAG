WRITTEN QUESTION P-4318/05 by Roger Helmer (NI) to the Commission (16 November 2005) Subject: Trade agreements/negotiations with countries outside the EU Is it the case that the EU has already concluded free trade agreements (FTAs) or other forms of preferential trading arrangements (such as generalised system of preference schemes for developing countries), or that it is negotiating such agreements or arrangements, with most countries in the world? Is it the case that the small number of countries with which the EU does not have (or is not negotiating) such agreements includes the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore — in other words, those English-speaking former colonies of the UK sometimes known as ‘The Anglosphere’? Is the Commission aware that UK goods exports to each of these countries account for approximately double the percentage of total exports than is the case for the remainder of the EU‑25? Is it not, therefore, abundantly clear that the pattern of EU FTAs is profoundly disadvantageous to the UK? Can it be mere coincidence that the pattern of EU FTAs is totally biased against the Anglosphere and against UK interests?
