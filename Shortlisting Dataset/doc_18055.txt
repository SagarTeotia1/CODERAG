Joint answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-011718/11 , E-011719/11 (9 February 2012) The EU is aware of the difficult situation faced by political activists in Sindh and elsewhere in Pakistan. Although the EU cannot directly intervene in the internal affairs of a partner country, it can convey its concern at the damage a climate of violence and intimidation does to a country’s overall development, and offer to share its experience in solving political issues through dialogue. The EU engages in regular dialogue with Pakistan on human rights and democratic principles, including civil and political rights. The EU has called on the Pakistani authorities, at the highest level, to adopt measures to protect the rights of Pakistanis citizens in line with international human rights standards and conventions, including signing and ratifying the Convention on Enforced Disappearances. The EU has consistently urged the Government of Pakistan to assure the security of all communities in the country. At the same time the EU is supporting projects which are intended to improve access to justice and also to improve the quality of law enforcement in Pakistan, not least with the police and prosecution services.
