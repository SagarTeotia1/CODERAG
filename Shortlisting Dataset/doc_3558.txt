the ETS. The report stresses that, if aviation is to be eventually incorporated into the wider ETS, there should at least be a pilot phase of a separate scheme covering the period 2008-2012. MEPs in the committee propose that, should aviation be eventually incorporated into a wider ETS, special conditions be applied to ensure it does not distort the market to the detriment of less protected sectors: a cap on the number of emission rights it is permitted to buy from the market, and a requirement to make a proportion of the necessary emissions reductions without trading, before being allowed to buy permits. The committee calls on the Commission to put forward other policy instruments to address the non-CO 2 impacts of aviation in parallel to the ETS.

The legislation covers areas from engine design and vessel manoeuvrability to crew safety and accommodation. The aim is to align Community technical rules with the advanced standards governing navigation of the Rhine, so as to establish a single scheme for the entire European inland waterway network. The directive will create a level playing field in the single market for inland waterway transport, thereby increasing competition and promoting higher safety, environmental and social standards. This is the final stage in a long process of revising the rules on inland waterway shipping which reached a standstill in Council because of a conflict of competences between the EC and the Central Commission for the Navigation on the Rhine. Under the new legislation, this conflict will be resolved by mutual recognition of certificates.

The regulation covers a whole range of matters, such as instruments and equipment, communication and navigation equipment, maintenance and transport of dangerous goods by air, and working hours for aircrews. Flight and duty time limitations and rest periods A major victory for Parliament at first reading was the introduction of a maximum basic daily Flight Duty Period (FDP). This will be 13 hours but can
