Joint answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-000081/11 , E-000580/11 (24 February 2011) The Commission would refer the Honourable Members to its answer to Written Questions E‑10808/10 and E‑8614/10 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB . In addition, as regards the funding of companies in order to allow them to fulfil the requirements of the simplified procedure, the Commission does not have any specific fund for companies in the pharmaceutical sector. However, where a Community herbal monograph established by the Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products has been published or a substance has been included in the EU list, registration is further facilitated and the cost to comply with the requirements of the simplified procedure is consequently reduced.
