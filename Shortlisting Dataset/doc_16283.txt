Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (21 April 2010) Medicinal plants are agricultural products as defined in Annex I of the Treaty. Farmers growing medicinal plants can in general benefit from the single payment scheme, which is decoupled from any specific type of production, provided that they comply with the eligibility conditions fixed by the relevant legislation [Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, OJ L 30, 31.1.2009. and Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 1120/2009 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1120/2009 of 29 October 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, OJ L 316, 2.12.2009. , 1121/2009 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 of 29 October 2009 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the support schemes for farmers provided for in Titles IV and V thereof, OJ L 316, 2.12.2009. and 1122/2009 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system, under the direct support schemes for farmers provided for that regulation, as well as for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards cross-compliance under the support scheme provided for the wine sector, OJ L 316, 2.12.2009. ].

In the specific, Measures 121 — ‘Modernization of Agricultural Holdings’ and 123 — ‘Adding value to agricultural and forestry products’ list medicinal plants among the ‘niche production sectors without negative impact on the environment or on competition’ where investments should be supported with priority.
