Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (29 August 2005) The technical arrangement adopted by the EU-Israel Customs Cooperation Committee does not affect the EU's position of principle on the Israeli practice of issuing preferential proofs of origin for goods coming from settlements in the occupied areas, which are not covered by the EU-Israel association agreement. In order to eliminate any possibility that the Community may be construed as having acquiesced to the Israeli practice, the technical arrangement provides that it ‘is without prejudice to the positions of the parties to the association agreement concerning the application of that agreement’. Preferential treatment is refused by Member States’ customs authorities for proofs of origin bearing the indication that the production conferring the originating status has taken place in a city, village or industrial zone brought under Israeli administration since 1967. In order to implement the arrangement, Israel requires its exporters and customs authorities to distinguish between production carried out in the territory of the State of Israel and production carried out in the occupied territories.
