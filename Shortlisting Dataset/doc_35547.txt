ORAL QUESTION H-0289/06 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Commission Subject: Demonstrations in France Hundreds of thousands of students, schoolchildren and workers have swarmed on to the streets of French cities, stepping up their protests against the law on first jobs, which gives employers the right to dismiss young people up to the age of 26 during their first two years of employment, without compensation or justification. Other Member States' governments have already taken or are being asked to take similar unpopular measures as part of the Lisbon Strategy to promote flexibility on the labour markets in order to boost the profits of monopolistic companies. The size and duration of these demonstrations show that the working class and young people of France and, more generally, workers in the Member States are not prepared to accept the gloomy prospect of 'employability' and work without rights reserved for them by the politics of big business. Does the Commission consider that the Lisbon Strategy is contrary to workers' interests and is meeting with mass resistance? Does it intend to reconsider its views on this matter?
