WRITTEN QUESTION P-2170/06 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (11 May 2006) Subject: Centre Party's proposal for youth contract At the end of the year, an EU directive (2000/78/EC OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16. ) on age discrimination will become law in Sweden. The aim is to prohibit all discrimination at work on grounds of age in connection with recruitment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions, thereby providing greater protection for young and old alike. The Court of Justice previously passed judgment against Germany for having reduced the job security of workers aged 52 and above, who could be employed on a temporary basis without justification or objective reason. In Sweden, the Centre Party has proposed a separate youth contract for the recruitment of young workers up to the age of 26. An amendment to the Law on Employment Protection would mean that young workers would be employed under a separate youth contract allowing termination of employment with immediate effect for a period of two years. There would also be mandatory severance pay of one month's salary after one year and two months' salary after two years. Does the Commission consider that the Centre Party's proposal for a separate youth contract would be consistent with the EU directive on age discrimination?
