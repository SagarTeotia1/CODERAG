Joint answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-009938/11 , P-010272/11 (6 March 2012) The EU follows the issue of the Camp Ashraf residents very closely. Their future continues to be a cause for concern. As a human rights issue, it requires the EU and the international community to do all we can to help the Government of Iraq to pursue a peaceful and orderly solution. This is why the High Representative/Vice-President has repeatedly stressed her full support to the ongoing process led by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. Now that the United Nations has publicly confirmed that the infrastructure and facilities at Camp Liberty are in accordance with international humanitarian standards, it is crucial that all concerned parties cooperate fully and constructively in order that the transfers to this temporary transit location proceed as smoothly and safely as possible. The ongoing process facilitated by the United Nations is key and it is clearly the only way forward, to bring about an orderly evacuation of Camp Ashraf. It has been confirmed that UN Human Rights monitors are to monitor all the moves of Ashraf camp residents and conduct around the clock monitoring at the transit location, Camp Liberty. Every individual and group who can bring any influence to bear on this matter has a responsibility to place the security and safety of the residents as their utmost priority.
