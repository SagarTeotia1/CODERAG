9999/C Q999 E/005 WRITTEN QUESTION P-0958/04 by Manuel dos Santos (PSE) to the Commission (18 March 2004) Subject: Risk transfer in the loan establishment operation carried out by the Portuguese Government The media have reported that, following the investigation opened by Eurostat into public book-keeping, the Commission validated a 2.8% GDP budgetary deficit (in 2003) submitted by the Portuguese Government. This figure can only be confirmed if the public accounts include the result of a government loan establishment operation carried out in agreement with Citigroup. It is not clear that the agreement ensures the total transfer of government risk to the investors in the loan establishment operation; if this turns out to be the case, it will invalidate the deficit figure submitted. 1. Is the Commission in a position to ensure that the credit establishment operation entails no risks for the Portuguese government, which means that all the extraordinary receipts entered on the accounts in 2003 will materialise? 2. Is the Commission familiar with the opinion drawn up by the IDEFE (a body linked to the Higher Economics and Management Institute), which claims that 19% of the loans now transferred are cancellable? 3. Was the Commission informed, and with what guarantees, of the existence of other government loans which could, possibly, replace any that should be cancelled?
