WRITTEN QUESTION E-3063/10 by João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (3 May 2010) Subject: Water supply and drainage systems in Galveias, Ponte de Sor (Portugal) On a recent visit to Galveias, in the municipality of Ponte de Sor (Portugal), I was alerted by the local parish council to the problems that exist there regarding the water supply and the drainage of waste water. No systems exist offering full coverage for the entirety of the population and the whole range of economic activity in the parish, let alone the activities which it might be hoped to attract in the near future. The parish council is interested in creating such systems, but is encountering difficulties over financing, especially concerning the degree of access to Community funds. In the light of the above, can the Commission state: 1. what Community funds have been allocated to date to the construction, repair or extension of the water supply and drainage systems in the municipality of Ponte de Sor; 2. what programmes and measures could be mobilised to support the creation of water supply and drainage systems in the parish of Galveias?
