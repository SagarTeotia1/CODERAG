WRITTEN QUESTION E-3037/06 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (5 July 2006) Subject: Review of EU strategy on the production and use of biofuels The strategy on biofuels sets objectives for the EU and imposes obligations on the Member States, which have not been met to date. The Commission is planning to initiate infringement procedures. Given the wide variations between the Member States in terms of technological progress, the size of markets, scale of production, the structure of fuel markets, etc., should there not be a review of this policy? Do statutory obligations not run counter to present economic and technological reality?
