Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (22 August 2011) In its communication adopted on 24 May 2011 COM(2011)292 final. , the Commission has proposed the launching of a Dialogue on migration, mobility and security with the Southern Mediterranean countries, starting in particular with Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. While the overall results of this exercise should be to enhance relations and develop cooperation in these three areas between these countries and the European Union (EU), a key objective should also be to establish conditions allowing, at the same time, more secure and smoother possibilities of mobility and migration for the citizens of the two parties. According to the Commission, the achievement of this result is not only in the interest of the Southern Mediterranean countries, but also in the interest of the European Union, namely for the following three reasons. First, the increased capacity of ‘bona fide’ travellers from Southern Mediterranean countries to enter the European Union territory for legitimate purposes such as business, tourism, study and people-to-people contacts can contribute to the EU's social and economic development. This is also the case for the increased capacity of migrants from those countries to fill –through regular procedures — job vacancies on the EU Member States' labour markets that were impossible to fill. Second, the establishment of more accessible and better managed regular channels for mobility and migration, combined with the entry into force and the effective implementation of more effective forms of cooperation for preventing irregular migration and readmitting irregular migrants, is likely to contribute to reducing the pressure of irregular migration flows on the EU external borders. Finally, in the framework of the Dialogue, it would also be possible for the EU Member States to put forward requests to the Southern Mediterranean countries to eliminate or reduce the barriers currently restricting the mobility and migration of EU citizens wishing to travel or install themselves on their territories, as well to more easily obtain satisfaction of these requests. While the number of EU citizens willing to permanently migrate to the Southern Mediterranean countries is likely to be and remain limited, we should not exclude that an increasing number of them may be interested in enhancing their capacity to travel, and temporarily establish themselves and work in these countries.
