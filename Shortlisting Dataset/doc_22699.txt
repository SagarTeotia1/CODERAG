Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (12 December 2011) The Commission is aware of the opinion adopted by the Portuguese data protection authority (CNPD) on 12 April 2010 See website: http://www.cnpd.pt/bin/decisoes/par/40_20_2010.pdf on a draft Law-Decree regulating the databases of the Public Security Police (PSP). The CNPD identified several issues and recommended to address them in the Law Decree to respect of data protection legislation (e.g. legitimacy; purpose limitation, quality of data, conditions for access to databases by police, disclosure of personal data, retention periods, rights of data subjects). The CNPD follows this matter. It has recently transmitted its concerns to the Government on the current legal situation. It has urged for rapid adoption of legislative measures ensuring the respect of national data protection law in this sector. The CNPD also conducts an audit on databases relating to law enforcement. The audit, which will be completed in 2012, should allow the CNPD to have an overview of the current situation. On the basis of this audit, the CNPD could make recommendations on conditions relating to the processing of personal data. At EU level, the processing of personal data is covered by Directive 95/46/EC Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. . The directive does not apply to police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and to public security, defence and national security. For the processing of personal data by law enforcement bodies at national level, no secondary legislation is in place and Member States must apply the relevant national rules that should provide a level of protection which corresponds at least to that laid down by Council of Europe Convention 108 of 1981 and its Additional Protocol. The framework Decision 2008/977/JHA Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, OJ L 350, 30.12.2008 , p. 60. applies only cross-border processing of personal data in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The Commission will present early 2012 legal proposals to establish a consistent data protection framework for the EU, as indicated in its communication of 4 November 2010 COM(2010) 609 final. 4.11.2010. .
