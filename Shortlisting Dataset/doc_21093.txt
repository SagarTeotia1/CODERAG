Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (27 November 2008) Under Directive 2001/77/EC Directive 2001/77/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, OJ L 283 , 27.10.2001. a national indicative target of 21 % was set for France regarding the share of renewable energy in total electricity consumption. So far France made no significant progress towards its target, and in 2007 the Commission opened an investigation of whether France has fulfilled its obligation to take appropriate steps to encourage greater consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources, in conformity with and proportionate to this target. At this moment, this question continues to be under review by the Commission. On a more positive note, there are signs of efforts now being stepped up to accelerate progress in France, and the statistics show encouraging trends especially for wind energy: According to industry figures the installed capacity had reached 3 027 MW by 15 May 2008, compared to 1 567 MW by end of 2006 Syndicat des énergies renouvelables – France Energie Eolienne – ADEME, press dossier for European Wind Day 2008: http://fee.asso.fr/content/download/1479/6049/file/DP%20Journ%C3%A9e%20europ%C3%A9enne%20de%20l'%C3%A9nergie%20%C3%A9olienne%202008.pdf , corresponding to almost a doubling in less than a year and a half. This said, the Commission considers that France's potential for wind energy is very far from being fully exploited. Several Member States with significantly less favourable conditions for wind energy have 5 to 10 times the installed capacity that France has, whether measured by area or per inhabitant. Regarding offshore wind specifically, France has also one of the best potentials in Europe, but no offshore wind farm has been constructed so far in French waters. The Commission is aware that a draft decree as referred to in the question has been under consideration with a view to classifying wind turbines of a certain size within the French ‘Installations Classées pour la Protection de l'Environnement’ (ICPE) system. According to the information available to the Commission, the decree may however not be adopted. It is the Commission's view that wind turbines when properly located and maintained represent an environmental improvement rather than a danger to the public or to the environment. Regarding what further measures France could take to promote renewable energy, the Commission intends to take stock of progress for all Member States in a report to be presented in early 2009 on the basis of the national reports received under the existing EU legislation on renewable energy Directive 2001/77/EC and Directive 2003/30/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport, OJ L 123, 17.5.2003. . As has been stressed for France before, simple, short and streamlined authorisation procedures are necessary to make adequate progress. Regarding measures at EU level, priority is the timely adoption and implementation of the draft directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources COM(2008)19 final. . Under this proposal Member States would
