Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (7 April 2011) The present non-discrimination and gender equality directives prohibit discrimination based on a number of grounds including gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. All Member States have implemented these directives into national law and this legislation provides the tools to combat discrimination throughout the EU. Multiple discrimination is not specifically and separately addressed in the directives, since the directives already allow tackling a combination of two or more grounds of discrimination.
