Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (4 August 2003) During the debates on these questions, the Member of the Commission responsible for Agriculture and Fisheries indicated to the Council on Agriculture and Fisheries of 8 April 2003 the Commission's willingness to examine the possibility to return to rotational set-aside and growing crops intended for non-food use insofar as control problems are settled. The final political compromise adopted by the Council on 26 June 2003 confirms the continuation of the non-food set-aside system, as a consequence the growing of industrial and energy crops in set-aside land will be possible. The set-aside land used for industrial and energy crops will continue to receive the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidy. The current controls applied on the non-food set-aside system avoid, in the Commission's opinion, the risk of fraud. The Commission does, however, intend to simplify the current control system when implementing the reform. The set-aside was created as a market regulation instrument, therefore the production of renewable raw materials is not its principal aim. The decoupling of production and income support does not change with respect to this first objective. Any restrictions on the use of set-aside land will continue to apply.
