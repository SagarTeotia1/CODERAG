Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2008) The EU's 20 % renewable energy target is ambitious and bio-energy will be an important contributor to meeting the target. However, a lot of the increase is expected to be met by using biomass waste and residues. The European Environment Agency report from 2006 on ‘How much bio-energy can Europe produce without harming the environment’ suggested that if strict environmental constraints are applied, 235 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) biomass is deemed feasible in 2020, which included around 15‑16 Mtoe from forestry residues (ca. 70 million m³) and an additional approximately 23 Mtoe (106 million m³) could be provided by complementary fellings and their residues. Considerable potential for complementary felling could be found in many parts of Europe, particularly in Central Europe, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom, while observing strict environmental conditions The main criteria for calculation were: No intensification of use of protected areas; foliage and roots were excluded from the calculations; the extraction rate of residues from stem and branches was limited according to the suitability of the site; a reduction of the area available for wood supply in each Member State by 5 % in order to allow for an increase in protected area; a set-aside of 5 % of wood volume as individual and small groups of retention trees after harvesting in order to increase the amount of large diameter trees and deadwood. . The Commission's intention is to ensure that the potential for increased forest utilisation for energy would not damage the long term environmental sustainability of forests. In order to prevent negative environmental impacts, the Commission proposed sustainability criteria for biofuels under the Renewable Energy Directive COM(2008)19 final. ; including restrictions on the use of biomass from highly biodiverse land such as undisturbed forests and nature protected areas; and of biomass obtained from conversion of high carbon stock land, such as continuously forested areas. The Commission has further undertaken to report on requirements on sustainability of biomass, and as a result, the Commission has launched a public consultation, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/consultation/uses_biomass_en.htm
