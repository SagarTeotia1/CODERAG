WRITTEN QUESTION E-5916/08 by Fiona Hall (ALDE) to the Commission (5 November 2008) Subject: Pricing of Adobe software Consumers in Europe are paying considerably more for Adobe software than consumers in the US. Adobe say this is due to the localisation of the software. However, some software is not localised and the same version is being sold in both Europe and the US. Is the Commission concerned that Adobe have a monopoly in this area, as there are no alternative products on the market, and that Adobe are overcharging European consumers for some products?
