Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (11 December 2006) The Commission is aware of the issue raised by the Honourable Member concerning unsolicited mail, such as lottery mailings that might be scams. In connection with this the Commission would like to refer to the relevant EU consumer protection legislation. Misleading advertising practices are banned under the current Misleading Advertising Directive 84/450/EEC Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning misleading advertising, OJ L 250, 19.9.1984. (e.g. if consumers are induced to pay transfer fees in advance by credit card in order to claim a prize, and subsequently receive no prize or a reasonable equivalent of the prize as promised by the letter). In the near future such practices will be prohibited under the new Directive 2005/29/EC Directive 2005/29/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’) (text with EEA relevance), OJ L 149, 11.6.2005. on Unfair Commercial Practices (UCP). UCP will further enhance the protection of consumers against scams and other misleading practices, as it will replace the present system based on minimum harmonisation by establishing a high, EU‑wide level of protection. The new national laws transposing UCP must be applicable by 12 December 2007 in all Member States. Cross-border scams like those the Honourable Member described fall under the competences of the new EU‑wide enforcement network. The Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (the Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation), text with EEA relevance, OJ L 364, 9.12.2004. was adopted on 7 October 2004 and enters fully into effect at the end of 2006. The regulation establishes a network of enforcement authorities and empowers them to detect, investigate and stop such infringements. The regulation is an essential part of our strategy to deter cross-border unfair practices and prevent consumers being harmed.
