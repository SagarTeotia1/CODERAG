Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (27 February 2008) Within the context of shared management of structural funding, responsibility for project implementation lies with the Managing Authority of the Member State concerned. The Commission is therefore not directly involved in the tendering process, cost-benefit analyses or the technical specificities of each of the projects selected by the Managing Authority. Nevertheless, in this specific case, the Commission is aware that the maximum capacity of the facility in question is of 250 tonnes. In line with Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/99 OJ L 337, 30.12.1999 . of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements on Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector, the Managing Authority may choose to finance investments of collective interest to fishermen using a port and contributing to the general development of the port and to the improvement of services offered to fishermen. Consequently, the hardstanding facility at Marsaxlokk was commissioned with the aim of facilitating the maintenance and repair of fishing vessels using the port, all of which are below 250 tonnes, with the exception of one registered fishing vessel as the Honourable Member points out. In line with Community provisions and national priorities for the sector, the aim of this specific project is that of meeting the collective needs of the Maltese fishing community. Clearly, on cost-benefit grounds, a managing authority may decide that total coverage of needs is not justified, particularly if all Maltese vessels may be repaired at the facility, with the exception of one. The Commission therefore considers that this project meets the FIFG (the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance) programme's objectives and has been implemented in line with the provisions of the FIFG Regulation.
