Joint answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-000069/12 , E-000088/12 (16 February 2012) EU legislation contains mandatory provisions obliging Member States to ensure access to asylum procedures for third‑country nationals seeking international protection. These provisions shall be respected in all circumstances, including situations of mixed flows and cases where such persons are present at the border crossing points or areas close to the external border of the Union. This is a key principle under EU asylum and migration acquis and aims to ensure respect for the principle of non ‑ refoulement . The Commission is closely monitoring Member States' compliance with these obligations. In addition, the Commission has presented proposals COM(2008) 820; COM(2009) 551; COM(2011) 319; COM(2011) 320. to improve EU asylum legislation by increasing the degree of harmonisation and enhancing standards, in line with international obligations. The proposals reinforce the provisions meant to ensure accessibility to the asylum procedure for persons who wish to apply for international protection. The proposals clarify, i.a. , that official who first come in contact with persons seeking international protection, in particular those carrying out border checks and surveillance of land or maritime borders, should receive instructions and necessary training on how to recognise and deal with people asking for international protection. The aim is to find a proper balance of standards which is both fair and efficient; the Commission is playing an active role in supporting the negotiations, with a view to an adoption of the legislative package by the end of 2012, as foreseen by the Stockholm Programme. Moreover, the Commission will support EASO in broadening the target groups of the European Asylum Curriculum training in order to include border guards. This would be done in full cooperation with Frontex.
