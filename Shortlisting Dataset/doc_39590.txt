of training and further training for distributors, advisors and professional users of pesticides whereby those who use or will use pesticides are fully aware of the potential risks to human health and the environment and of the appropriate measures to reduce those risks as much as possible. Training activities for professional users should be co-ordinated with those organised in the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) OJ L 277, 21.10.2005, p. 1.

(8) Considering the ▐risks from the use of pesticides, in particular their acute and chronic health effects and their environmental effects, consumers and the general public should be ▐informed , particularly through the media, but also through awareness raising campaigns, information passed on through retailers and other appropriate measures , about both the health and environmental risks and short and long-term adverse effects related to the use of pesticides , and about non-chemical alternatives. Member States should monitor and collect data on impacts of pesticide use, including poisoning incidents, and promote long-term research programmes on the effects of pesticide use . (9) To the extent that the handling and application of pesticides requires the setting of minimum health and safety requirements at the workplace, covering the risks arising from exposure of workers to such products, as well as general and specific preventive measures to reduce those risks, those measures are covered by Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work OJ L 131, 5.5.1998, p. 11.
