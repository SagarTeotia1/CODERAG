WRITTEN QUESTION E-6399/08 by Emilio Menéndez del Valle (PSE) to the Council (27 November 2008) Subject: Palestine/Israel: the Quartet's official press release of 9 November 2008 and the reality of daily life in the occupied Palestinian territories The verbose press release recently published by the Quartet is suffused with optimism with regard to the agreements reached between Israelis and Palestinians in the wake of the international Annapolis Conference of 27 November 2007. It states that ‘the Quartet emphasised the importance of continuity in the peace process. The Quartet agreed that the spring of 2009 could be an appropriate time for an international meeting in Moscow’. Continuity till when? Obviously, the conviction voiced by President Bush in Annapolis that a Palestinian State would be born before the end of his mandate is at several removes from reality. Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian Negotiating Team, has made statements, in the wake of the Quartet statement, which are very far from sharing its optimism. He says that a year after the Israeli Prime Minister Olmert promised in Annapolis that Israel would respect its obligations with regard to the Roadmap, which include putting an end to all settlement activity, settlement has not merely continued but has increased, while the number of Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories has risen from 286 000 in 1993 to 486 000 at the present time. Furthermore, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the restrictions imposed on the movement of Palestinians by Israel have increased by 20 % since Annapolis. Can the Council confirm the real existence of substantive, consolidated progress which will make it possible once and for all to establish a viable Palestinian State which will, as the Palestinian Authority accepted some time ago, exist on only 22 % of Palestine's historic territory, with the other 78 % being reserved for the State of Israel?
