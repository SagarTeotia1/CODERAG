effective cooperation with third countries, notably the US, is an essential part of an effective EU strategy to deal with these challenges. However, effective cooperation requires resources. The rapporteur notes that spending on "cooperation with non-EU industrialised countries" is extremely low. In 2005, around EUR 16 million was the total spent on budget line 19 05 02. What are the resources? Table 1: Indicative spending on external policies (EUR million) Heading 2007 2007-2013 Pre-accession (IPA) 1193 10213 Neighbourhood and Partnership (ENPI) 1390 10587 Development Co-op (DCEC) 2000 15103 Stability Instrument 232 2531 CSFP 150 1740 Loan Guarantee Fund 188 1244 Emergency Aid Reserve taken out of MFF Other 1046 8046 Total 6633 49463 15. The new multi-annual financial framework for 2007-2013 that is due to be adopted by the European Parliament at the May plenary session foresees resources of around EUR 50 billion for external relations under Heading 4: "The EU as a global partner". The figures in the table highlight the continuing focus on "traditional" challenges in EU external spending. Of course, spending on policies related to some of the newer challenges comes under other headings. For example, "freedom, security and justice" has its own heading (3A) and an allocation of over EUR 6.5 billion over the MFF. Another example, in the context of energy policy, is spending on nuclear decommissioning under "competitiveness for growth and employment". This will amount to EUR 1.3 billion over the MFF. Some questions for the hearing · Does the Commission believe that a clearer definition of what consitutes a "strategic" relationship is necessary in the context of its relations with third countries and regions? What is the role of the transatlantic partnership in this context? · What will be the relative importance of the "traditional" and "new" challenges that the EU faces over the period 2007 - 2013? What further shifts can one anticipate? How should EU spending on external priorities evolve, for example as regards energy security? · What steps can be taken in the 2007 budgetary procedure in order to reflect these changing challenges and priorities for an increasingly outward looking EU? on CFSP and ESDP "Life belongs to the living, and he who lives must be prepared for changes" Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 - 1832) Background 1. Cross-pillar nature of this area remains with CFSP/ESDP matters falling under the second pillar alongside Community policies (first pillar). In external actions, many actions span both the CFSP area and a range of 1st pillar activities where the Community is competent. This is one main factor to explain why it is so difficult to get a coherent overview of actions that are often inter-woven in a specific area or even on a specific matter. Community and CFSP actions can be complementing each other but, also, overlap each other. 2. Aditionally, even within the specific sphere of CFSP/ESDP, matters are further complicated by multiple sources of funding where some parts are financed from the general budget and others from the Member States. Also, the Council's budget is involved. In the rapporteur's view, it is necessary
