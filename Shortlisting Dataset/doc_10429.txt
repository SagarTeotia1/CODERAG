Answer given by High Representative / Vice President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (6 July 2010) Some twenty six years after the event, the Commission is well aware of the pressing need for the clear-up operation to be completed in the wake of the Bhopal industrial disaster. This being said, the Commission could only intervene if requested to do so by the Indian authorities, and this has never been the case. Since the time of the disaster the Indian government has never identified this as a specific priority for EU involvement, neither in terms of arbitration, nor in terms of assistance under the EU‑India cooperation programme. This latter programme, in agreement with the Indian Government and with the approval of the European Council and the Parliament, was, and continues to be focused on wider health and education programmes. Nevertheless, this programme does include a component under which activities on industrial accident prevention have been carried out. One example of a project co-funded by the Commission is the ERRIS project (Environmental Risk Reporting Information System, 2005-2007 http://www.erris.org ), with the participation of the Commission's Major Accident Hazards Bureau, in which an emergency response and risk management system for India has been developed and training of the safety and planning authorities has been provided. India and the EU have been engaged in a dialogue on environmental issues for some years. A high-level joint working group meets on a regular basis, and it is clear that India has now put in place very stringent environmental legislation intended to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
