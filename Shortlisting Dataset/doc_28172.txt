parents. In the 2008‑10 round of national strategy reports, specific attention was paid to children deprived of parental care in general, and this will be reflected in the supporting document for the 2009 joint report, to be released in February 2009. In January 2008, the Social Protection Committee adopted a report ‘Child Poverty and Well-Being in the EU' http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/publications_en.htm#childpoverty , which sets out 15 recommendations for improving the monitoring of children's well-being at national and EU levels. In this area, specific attention should be paid to the most vulnerable children, including those deprived of parental care. On the issue of children's well-being, the Commission has commissioned a study, to be finalised by the end of 2009, gathering expert advice on ways of following up those recommendations. The Commission will also work with the Indicator's Sub-Group of the Social Protection Committee on these issues. As regards the social consequences of workers’ mobility within the EU, the Commission is launching a study to evaluate the feasibility of a specific survey instrument targeted at people who have lived in more than one Member State and comparing the social outcomes of people who have lived in different countries and those who have always remained in the same country. The specific situation of parents moving abroad without their children could be addressed in this context.
