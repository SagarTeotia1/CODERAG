WRITTEN QUESTION E-5841/09 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Council (25 November 2009) Subject: EU school fruit scheme In order to prevent the acquisition of poor eating habits and avoid vitamin deficiencies, which can lead to a number of illnesses, it is necessary to start young. The sweeping generalisation made about the ‘working class’ is that they choose a lifestyle of fast food and video games. Eating habits are often shaped by behaviours acquired during the (pre) school years and the example given by parents. Within the EU, a number of innovative approaches to school meals exist, such as the use of organic, locally sourced and fair-trade products in Italy or free school meals in Finland. On 28 September 2009, a new campaign to encourage healthy eating among European school children kicked off. Children are to be provided with free fruit to encourage them to develop healthy eating habits. For the EU 27, around EUR 90 million has been set aside for this purpose, of which a good EUR 1 million has been allocated to Austria. However, the start of the scheme has been barely perceptible in Austrian schools to date. As ever, children are being tempted by high-carbohydrate, high-sugar snacks in school canteens. There is fruit here and there — not always in the best condition and sometimes shrivelled. 1. To what extent has the scheme already been put into practice in the EU Member States? 2. In which Member States is the scheme still working as a pilot project? 3. Has a first interim assessment already been carried out? 4. What follow-up projects are being planned? 5. To what extent is there a similar scheme for dairy products on an EU level, or is such a scheme under discussion?
