right exceptionally granted by Rule 7 (4) of the Rules of Procedure. It has to be absolutely clear that this precludes any form of detention or any other measure which prevents the Member from performing his duties as a parliamentarian but only until final judgment is given by the Court. It means that once final judgment is passed in this case, Dr Zelesný will have to face it in the same way as any other citizen without there be any need to request again the waive of his immunity. The effect of Rule 7 (4) is that immunity is waived and so the proceedings may go on, but no measure hampering the Member from performing his duties is allowed until the final sentence is passed. Final sentence also covers any appeal until all avenues of appeal are exhausted. IV CONCLUSION In the light of the above considerations, pursuant Rule 7(1) and (2) of the Rules of Procedure, after having considered the arguments for and against waiving immunity, the JURI recommends that the EP waive Mr Vladimir Zelezný's parliamentary immunity, subject to the condition that the waiver of immunity shall apply solely to the prosecution proceedings and that, until such time as final sentence is given, Dr Zelesný must be immune from any form of detention or remand or any other measure which prevents him from performing the duties attaching to his mandate as a Member of the European Parliament.
