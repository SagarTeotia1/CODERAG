Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (23 February 2012) The measures which the Commission encourages are designed to improve Greece’s financial, economic and social situation. The comprehensive reforms that Greece is enacting in this context have of course wide-ranging impacts which need to be monitored and reviewed regularly. The Commission considers that further corrective measures are needed to improve the functioning of the labour market and to restore Greece's competitiveness. The negotiations in the context of the economic adjustment programme have been involving not only the government but also the social partners and triggered a national debate involving all socioeconomic stakeholders. The ongoing dialogue between the Greek Government and the social partners on reforms enhancing the country's competitiveness should help in meeting that objective. The Commission is committed to promoting social dialogue throughout the Union, with due regard for the diversity of national industrial relations systems. The Commission proposes to the Council to issue recommendations to Member States in the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy/European Semester. To avoid double surveillance, the economic adjustment programme for Member States such as Greece is the single reference point for all policy recommendations and these Member States are primarily called upon to implement that programme.
