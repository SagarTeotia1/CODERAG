Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (5 May 2010) In accordance with the Treaties, abortion as such does not fall within the competence of the Union, but is the primary responsibility of the Member States. The Commission thus does not possess comprehensive information about abortion in the Member States which it could transmit to the Honourable Member.
