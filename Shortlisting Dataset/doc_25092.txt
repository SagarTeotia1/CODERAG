work on reduced rates of VAT. The report will normally be followed by public consultation of all stakeholders concerned. This should prepare the ground for a new Commission proposal on reduced rates of VAT offering a lasting solution in this field. The introduction of a reduced rate within a particular region of a Member State is not allowed under current Community legislation. The principle of fiscal neutrality whereby similar goods and services may not be treated differently in terms of VAT must be complied with. Having different VAT rates in different parts of a Member State would therefore run counter to that objective. In conclusion, if it wishes the United Kingdom may apply a reduced rate of VAT to hotels throughout its territory, but not to restaurants. However, the application of a rate of less than 5 % to hotels would infringe the current provisions.
