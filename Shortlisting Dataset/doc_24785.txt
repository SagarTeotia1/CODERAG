Question for oral answer O-0126/2010 to the Commission Rule 115 Marielle De Sarnez on behalf of the ALDE Group Subject: Import of Laogai-made Goods into the European Union Laogai is the system of forced labour prisons in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The Laogai system has been condemned by Parliament and is a regular topic in the EU-PRC Human Rights Dialogue. Most Laogai prisons are economic entities with commercial company names. These names hide the true nature of the products being produced, which are thus sold freely in and outside the PRC. Proof of this practice is found in many business catalogues, first and foremost in Dun & Bradstreet, which lists 330 known Laogai prisons. Laogai camps also advertise on the internet. Approximately 500 camps that advertise have been identified. Though rarely proven, Laogai is most probably also the source of many Chinese-made counterfeit products. Applying its law prohibiting the import of convict-made goods, the US has banned products emanating from several such companies from the US market. The EU has no such law (yet). – Considering that EU consumers and companies must be protected against inadvertently purchasing Laogai-made goods, and – having regard to Parliament’s resolutions condemning the Laogai system and to the EU-PRC Human Rights Dialogues; What actions will the Commission take in order to prevent the direct or indirect import of Laogai and/or other convict-made goods into the EU? When will the Commission start to cooperate as closely as possible with the US authorities – namely US Customs – on the matter of detecting these goods? When will the Commission start negotiations with the PRC in order to obtain a mutually binding agreement that the PRC will prevent the direct or indirect export of Laogai-made goods to the EU and/or their sale to EU-owned companies in the PRC?
