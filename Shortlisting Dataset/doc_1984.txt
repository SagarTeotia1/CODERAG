Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (18 August 2010) European tourism is currently faced with many global challenges one of which is the financial and economic crisis which impacts on the tourism sector. Increased tourism activity at European level should therefore be encouraged more so in the light of the recent additional competences in tourism following the entering into force of the Lisbon Treaty. In order to encourage an increasing participation of European citizens in tourism, the Commission with the support of the relevant budgetary authorities initiated the implementation of the preparatory action ‘Calypso’ in 2009. This project aims at giving better access to tourism for 4 target groups (youth, seniors, families facing social difficulties and disabled people) that in the tourism low season. This initiative could lead to strengthening the competitiveness of small and medium‑sized enterprises, enhance employment, strengthen European citizenship; extend the tourism seasonality patterns and improve regional/local economies through the development of social tourism. In this regard, the Commission is currently in the concluding phase of a study that will propose one or several mechanisms for a European-wide exchange of tourist in low season. Such a European mechanism could target all tourism stakeholders, including the tourism industry, whilst promoting the need for criteria (such as those relating to accessibility, sustainability & income thresholds) that could ensure an appropriate framework for such tourism exchanges. This criteria framework for the tourism supply and demand sides will be elaborated and defined together with Member States, representatives of the tourism industry, consumers and other stakeholders in the near future.
