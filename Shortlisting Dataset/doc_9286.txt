WRITTEN QUESTION E-2189/09 by Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven (Verts/ALE) and David Hammerstein (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (31 March 2009) Subject: The National Park of East Macedonia-Thrace in the Republic of Greece: Kompsatos Dam, Nestos Delta There are important threats for the National Park due to the non-compliance of the new Ministerial Decree (October 2008) with the existing pSCI, SPA and/or Ramsar boundaries. The Kompsatos Dam: The Kompsatos River is the last non-dammed main river in the National Park and in north-eastern Greece. A large irrigation dam is planned. The dam is located in an area of outstanding undisturbed nature that is protected under the EU Wild Birds Directive (79/409/EEC OJ L 103, 25.4.1979, p. 1. , code GR1130012) with large numbers of rare and endangered plant and animal species, especially birds of prey. The missing fresh water (water will be diverted to the irrigation system of Komotini Plain) in the wetland system, especially Lake Vistonis and Vistonis Bay will cause irreversible damage to the sensitive wetlands and the fisheries, including in the entire northern Aegean Sea. The area of the former ‘Voice of America’, which is the ‘heart’ of the Nestos Delta, including unique marshes, riparian forests and sand dunes, is foreseen as ‘Zone B5 — A zone for tourism-industry’. This area (more than 600 ha) is, owing to its unique character and inaccessibility, a central focal point for rare wildlife species like the Golden Jackal, wild geese, birds of prey and many others. Any opening of the area for large-scale tourism and especially for construction would severely harm the essence of the National Park. How will the Commission prevent the destruction of the European natural heritage located at the Kompsatos Dam and at the Nestos Delta in the National Park of East Macedonia-Thrace in the Republic of Greece?
