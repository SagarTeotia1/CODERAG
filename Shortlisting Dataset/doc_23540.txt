Preliminary answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (4 May 2010) The issues raised in the question of the Honourable Member are directly linked to the competencies of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Following the accident the European Aviation Safety Agency launched urgently a rulemaking task before issuing on 31 August 2009 an Airworthiness Directive affecting the pitot probes fitted on aircraft of the family Airbus A330/340. The Commission has requested the Agency to provide the elements of the reply to the Honourable Member's question. The Commission will send the Agency's reply to the Honourable Member as soon as possible.
