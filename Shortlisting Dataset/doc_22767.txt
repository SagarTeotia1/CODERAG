Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2005) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the Parliament and the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC OJL 146, 13.6.2003 has been applicable since 3 July 2003. This Regulation applies to the movement between Member States or from third countries of pet animals of the species listed in its Annex I, which includes dogs. The Directive makes no distinction between guide dogs and other dogs kept only as pet animals. The purpose of requiring a passport is to have a single standardised veterinary document at EU level to facilitate the control and movement of the animals mentioned in Annex I of the Regulation. It is a European veterinary certificate which will accompany the animal throughout its life and in which all events relating to its health can be entered. The general rule for movements between Member States other than Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK) is a current valid vaccination against rabies. However, a five-year transitional period from the date of entry into force of the Regulation was established for these Member States, during which the entry of dogs and cats into their territories is subject to additional requirements such as a proper identification system through an electronic microchip (transponder) Until 3rd July 2011, a tattoo will be allowed as a way to identify the animal, except for UK, Ireland and Malta which already now require the transponder , a passport issued by a veterinarian authorised by the competent authority certifying, in addition to the requirement set out in Article 5 of the Regulation (anti-rabies vaccination), that a neutralising antibody titration (a test to see if the vaccine has been effective) at least equal to 0,5 International Units per millilitre (IU/ml) has been carried out in an approved laboratory. In addition to that, Article 16 of the Regulation provides that for a transitional period of five years, those Member States which have special rules for the control of echinococcosis and ticks on the date of entry into force of the Regulation may make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with those requirements. Therefore, it can be concluded that besides the requirements of Article 5, the movements into the above-mentioned three Member States need to respect the conditions set out in Articles 6 and 16 of the Regulation.
