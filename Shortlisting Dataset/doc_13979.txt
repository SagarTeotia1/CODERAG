WRITTEN QUESTION E-2104/07 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (19 April 2007) Subject: Possible discrimination by Luxembourg against lawyers from other countries practicing in Luxembourg Following the Court of Justice’s judgment of 19 September 2006, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has allowed lawyers from other Member States to be sworn in as lawyers in that country. Luxembourg has, however, introduced a number of discriminatory measures and restrictions. It has drawn up four lists, and lawyers from other Member States can only be included on the fourth list. The other three are solely for Luxembourgish lawyers, who are therefore the only ones fully able to practice law. To gain access to List I, lawyers from other Member States must provide evidence of genuine, uninterrupted experience in practicing law. The Bar Council decides whether or not to admit a lawyer, in accordance with the Bar Council circular of 1 March 2007. Furthermore, despite the aforementioned judgment of the Court of Justice, the circular of 20 October 2006 states that ‘those wishing to be included on List II, or colleagues on List IV wishing to be included on List I, are still obliged to take a Luxembourgish language test’. Does the Commission take the view that Luxembourg’s arrangements for allowing lawyers from other EU Member States to practice in the country amount to discrimination against them, to the benefit of lawyers from Luxembourg? Does the Commission take the view that the Luxembourg Bar Council circular of 1 March 2007 amounts to a breach of the Court of Justice’s judgment of 19 September 2006 and the provisions it contains?
