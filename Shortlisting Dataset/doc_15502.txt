not even reached First Reading in Parliament yet. The "old" legal base, Decision 2004/904/EC is due to be repealed as of 1 January 2008 and replaced by the new programme from that date on. 9. Given the importance attached to the integration of migrants and the effective management of borders in the APS resolution and in light of the political attention that migration issues frequently attract, one might examine in more detail the degree to which the budgetary situation regarding solidarity and management of migration flows and the European Refugee Fund is satisfactory. Other areas of spending in Heading 3a and related issues 10. It is confusing to note that under the general programme "Fundamental rights and justice" a specific programme "Fundamental rights and citizenship " CNS2005/0038 is proposed by the Commission which is not financed under subheading 3b - Citizenship, but under subheading 3a. 11. Looking more closely at "Other actions and programmes", EUR 68 million out of EUR 78,4 million is due to go to lines 18 02 04 and 05, called Schengen information system (SIS II) COM(2005)236 report COELHO and Visa information system (VIS) COM(2004)835 report LUDFORD . SIS II consists basically of a large computer based in Strasbourg giving Member States the possibility of detecting wanted persons, following the abolition of internal border controls. VIS also is a database facilitating the exchange of data concerning the common visa policy and consular cooperation between Member States on applications in order to prevent threats to internal security of any of the Member States, to prevent the bypassing of the criteria for application and to facilitate the fight against fraud and to assist in the identification and return of illegal immigrants. Whereas the objectives for these two actions can be fully subscribed to, important budgetary questions remain. For example, in the financial statement of the proposal, EUR 14,4 million and EUR 24 million have been foreseen for SIS II and VIS. However, in the PDB 2007, budget lines 18 02 04 and 18 02 05 foresee EUR 20 million and EUR 48, million respectively. It would be interesting to have further information as to what explains these differences. 12. As regards Pilot Projects and Preparatory Actions The Commisson has presented a separate "Report on Pilot Projects and Preparatory Actions (article 49, point 2 letter b of the Financial Regulation)", COM(2006)300, p. 40 , according to the Commission, the appropriations for pilot schemes in PDB 2007 amount to EUR 1 million in commitments and EUR 22,7 million in payments. For preparatory actions the figures are EUR 3,3 million and EUR 47 million respectively (Document I, p. 8). This could reflect the integration of several of the previous pilot schemes and preparatory actions into the new generation of programmes (e.g. terrorism). The Commission considers that this leaves ample scope for new actions. a. The only pilot project under heading 3a is "Fight against Terrorism". The figures are as follows: Table 2 Line DG responsible 2005 2006 2007 Name Budget 2005 Budget 2006 Budget 2007 CA PA CA PA CA PA HEADING 3a 18
