Answer given by Mr Figel' on behalf of the Commission (17 October 2007) Under Article 149 of the Treaty, Community action may encourage cooperation between Member States, and, if necessary, support and supplement their action, but responsibility for the content and organisation of education systems rests entirely with the Member States themselves. It is thus for each Member State to decide how to include ethical and religious values in its school curricula and whether to create standards for the teaching of ethics and religion. These are not matters on which the Commission has competence to act. As noted by the Honourable Member, however, the Union is able to support exchanges of experience and good practice in the field of education, including in the areas of ethics and religious values, and it will continue to do so through the lifelong learning programme.
