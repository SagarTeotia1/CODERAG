rule of law and the spread of fundamental freedoms and human rights; stresses that mutual cooperation in these areas constitutes an added value for both EU and ENP countries; 3. Appreciates existing EU mobility programmes and regional projects, and affirms that, in particular, the EU programmes aimed at young people have had a significant impact in terms of enhancing education and training opportunities for youth; underlines that cultural and educational exchanges or cooperation can strengthen civil society, foster democratisation and promote mutual understanding between peoples; calls, therefore, on the Member States, as far as possible, to enable the best students from ENP countries to gain access to education or training and to receive grants to study in the EU; 4. Calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to open up the next generation of mobility, education and youth programmes (from 2014) to the EU’s neighbouring countries, thereby enabling these countries to participate in such programmes; invites the Commission to broaden the range of mobility programmes, inter alia by including an exchange programme for civil society and social enterprise professionals; calls on the Member States to promote training (including programmes for learning the languages of neighbouring countries) and twinning initiatives for civil servants; 5. Recalls the importance of making exchange programmes reciprocal, so that young people from the EU also have the opportunity to receive education in countries participating in the ENP; 6.

Emphasises the need to enhance synergies between Youth on the Move and the ENP, in order to ensure that student mobility between the EU and neighbourhood countries can benefit from more opportunities, in the interests both of the EU and of young people from those countries, and stresses that this must go hand in hand with the promotion of such projects by the media in EU neighbourhood countries; 10. Calls on the Commission to conclude more partnership agreements with neighbouring countries in the area of mobility; points out, in this connection, that the disparity in income between inhabitants of the EU and those of the ENP
