Question for written answer E-005757/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE) (15 June 2011) Subject: Consequences of holding bonds of over-indebted economies for the economies of central and south-east Europe According to a recent report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/news/rep11full.pdf , in the countries where it operates, GDP is expected to increase in both 2011 and in 2012, despite the fact that GDP in the countries of central and south-east Europe is still lower than before the economic crisis. At the same time, inflationary pressures in these countries, but also the exposure of European banks — many of which are financing development in central and south-east Europe — to the bonds of over-indebted regional economies in the eurozone, are risk factors for their development. In view of the above, will the Commission say: (a) Has it noted a lack or scarcity of funding by European banks in the countries of central and south-east Europe owing to their exposure to the bonds of over-indebted regional economies? (b) If so, does it have any estimates of the impact this may have on the rate of growth of those states, given that this report acknowledges that there is a ‘contagion risk’ of the turmoil on the financial markets? (c) Does it consider that the possible contagion of the countries of central and south-east Europe could increase the problems of the eurozone and the EU? (d) Does it intend to take measures to avoid the spread of the turmoil on the financial markets to the economies of these countries?
