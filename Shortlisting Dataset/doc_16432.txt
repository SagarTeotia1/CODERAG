Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2011) 1. The Commission does not keep data on whether foie gras was served or not at events linked with Commission activities. Therefore the Commission does not have information regarding the potential amount of money spent on foie gras at such events. 2 and 3. The Commission does not have an official policy requesting not to serve foie gras at events linked with Commission activities and has not included a ban on foie gras in the Commission contracts with suppliers and restaurateurs. The production of foie gras is not prohibited in the European Union and the Commission has not considered introducing such a policy or ban.
