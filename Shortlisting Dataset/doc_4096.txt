Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (30 August 2011) 1. The Commission is aware of and is following up on animal welfare problems in connection with the transport of live animals from certain Member States to Turkey. 2. In accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1206/2010 of 16 December 2010 fixing the export refunds on beef and veal OJ L 333, 17.12.2010. since December 2010 the only animals qualifying for export refunds are young live bovine female animals; it amounts to EUR 12.90 per 100 kg live weight. The refund is granted subject to compliance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 817/2010 of 16 September 2010 laying down detailed rules pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards requirements for the granting of export refunds related to the welfare of live bovine animals during transport (recast) OJ L 245, 17.9.2010. , which establishes the link between refund and compliance with animal welfare rules applicable to transport of animals on EU territory. 3. The Commission is not considering an EU‑wide ban on the transport of live animals. 4./5. There are no subsidies for the slaughter of animals in their country of origin, or for the export of animals for slaughter. 6./7./8. The competent authorities of the Member States do not have the obligation to set up ‘reception centres’. 9. The increased number of live animal transports into Turkey is, amongst others, the result of the improved animal health status of Turkish Thrace, which was recognised by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in May 2010 as a zone free from foot-and-mouth disease in which vaccination against that disease is practiced. This status does not allow introducing susceptible animals from the Anatolian part of Turkey or from third countries which are not free from foot-and-mouth disease. Imports from Turkey into the EU of live animals susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease and any of their products are prohibited in accordance with EU animal health legislation, unless products of animal origin are subjected to a treatment that mitigates the risk of introduction of various pathogens. Empty vehicles used for transport of live animals into Turkey must be cleansed and disinfected before returning into the EU.
