WRITTEN QUESTION E-2352/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (23 April 2008) Subject: Advertising of drugs Advertisements to the public of prescribed drugs is prohibited in the EU. This is of no real consequence commercially, as such drugs cannot be purchased ‘over the counter’ but can only be prescribed by a registered doctor. On the other hand, advertisements for drugs in doctors' magazines and directly to doctors' lobbying activities are intensive and uncontrolled. Does the Commission have a clear understanding of the issue of advertising of drugs to doctors? Is the Commission fully satisfied that such advertising is done in an ethically correct and commercially acceptable manner? Should advertising of drugs to doctors come under closer scrutiny and control by the competent authorities of each Member State?
