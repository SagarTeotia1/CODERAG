Question for written answer E-012139/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (5 January 2012) Subject: Political assassinations in Europe In an interview on 29.11.2011, Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, spoke about the impunity enjoyed by those responsible for the assassination of journalists, investigative reporters, lawyers and human rights activists in Europe. He stated that there had been no effective investigations in a series of cases involving the abduction and/or murder of journalists, researchers, lawyers and human rights activists in Europe. He also said that he had reason to believe that the masterminds behind these crimes exerted pressure and used all their influence with government agencies investigating the cases in order to prevent investigations reaching any conclusions and identifying those responsible. In view of the above, will the Commission say: — Has it noted any escalation in the political assassination or kidnapping of journalists, investigators, lawyers and human rights activists in Europe in recent years and, if so, to what does it attribute this escalation? What are the conclusions from the data cited by Europol?
