WRITTEN QUESTION E-3517/06 by Michael Cramer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (26 July 2006) Subject: Incorporating aviation into emissions trading The Commission is considering incorporating aviation into the European emissions trading scheme. 1. How does the Commission propose to deal with the fact that no alternative aviation propulsion methods are available? 2. How does the Commission intend to bring about compatibility with the Kyoto Protocol, and by when does it consider that incorporating aviation into the European emissions trading scheme is realistic? 3. How does the Commission propose to incorporate third-country airlines into emissions trading? How, in this instance, are what are termed ‘code share’ flights to be dealt with? 4. Should aviation be incorporated into emissions trading, how will the Commission classify no-fault and additional emissions resulting from stacking at congested airports, or weather-related or air traffic management (ATM) related diversions)? 5. ATM improvements within Europe could prevent up to 8 % of aviation emissions. What action does the Commission intend to take, and by when, to improve ATM within Europe? 6. What environmental impact does the Commission expect from incorporating aviation into emissions trading? 7. Does the Commission know what proportion aviation would account for in 2030: (a) with a ‘business as usual’ scenario? (b) if it participated in emissions trading? (c) if an appropriate kerosene tax were introduced as in motor vehicle transport? 8. What long-term objectives for emissions reduction (until 2030) does the Commission intend to impose on European air transport through emissions trading? 9. Road transport causes more than 80 % of transport-related CO2 emissions. When is the Commission likely to incorporate other modes, particularly road transport, into emissions trading?
