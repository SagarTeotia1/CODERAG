Question for oral answer O-000131/2011 to the Commission Rule 115 Elmar Brok , Michael Gahler , Krzysztof Lisek , Anna Ibrisagic , Ria Oomen-Ruijten , Ioannis Kasoulides , José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on behalf of the PPE Group Subject: Situation in Nagorno-Karabakh In recent months we have witnessed the supply of large quantities of arms from Russia to Armenia and Azerbaijan. This may provoke increased tension, especially around the Nagorno-Karabakh region and in the whole area of the South Caucasus. Is the HR/VP aware of these developments and monitoring this situation? What steps does the European Union intend to take in order to prevent a potential escalation of the conflict? Has the EU announced any disincentives vis-à-vis any parties to the conflict that breach the Bishkek ceasefire agreement?
