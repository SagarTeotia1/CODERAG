Question for written answer E-6278/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Filip Kaczmarek (PPE) (17 August 2010) Subject: Official languages of the European Union The right to linguistic diversity is one of the governing principles of the EU institutions. As of 2007, 23 languages have the status of official EU languages. Under Article 24 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, every citizen may write to any of the EU institutions in any of the official languages and receive an answer in the same language. With reference to the Council's answer of 5 July 2010, given in English, on medical care for Sakharov Prize winner Hu Jia: Why is the Council unable to provide answers in the ‘new’ languages? Which official EU languages have the status of ‘new’ languages? When can the Council be expected to begin providing answers in ‘new’ languages?
