Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (5 May 2010) A variety of different technologies can be used for the screening of persons at airports. Some of the Security Scanners developed so far use low doses of X-rays to detect prohibited articles carried in or under the clothes. As regards the use of X-ray equipment, European legislation regulates the safety aspects of security scanners like any other equipment using ionizing radiations. The risk of long-term health effects from exposure to ionizing radiation is well known and this knowledge forms the basis of the legislation issued under Chapter 3 (Health and Safety) of the Euratom Treaty. The use of X-ray body scanners (as opposed to other available body scanner technologies, which do not use ionizing radiation) shall respect the provisions of Directive 96/29/Euratom Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 may 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation, OJ L 159, 29.6.1996. , including the application of the following main principles: — justification of the use of a type of equipment before being first put in operation regarding its economic, social or other benefits in relation to the health detriment it may cause; — optimisation of protection to ensure that the radiation exposure of workers, members of the public and the population as a whole resulting from the practice is kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account; — limitation of the exposure to ensure that the sum of the doses from all relevant practices will not exceed the legal dose limits for workers or members of the public; Ensuring compliance with the above provisions falls under the responsibility of the national authorities. The deliberate exposure of people to ionizing radiation for non-medical reasons, including for security purposes, is given specific consideration http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radiation_protection/doc/art31/2010_02_24_opinion_on_bss.pdf in the ongoing recast of Directive 96/29/Euratom with other directives, in particular Directive 97/43/Euratom Council Directive 97/43/Euratom of 30 June 1997 on health protection of individuals against the dangers of ionizing radiation in relation to medical exposure, and repealing Directive 84/466/Euratom, OJ L 180, 9.7.1997. on medical exposure. Security Scanners are currently not specifically regulated at EU level. Member States have a certain degree of freedom to deploy this equipment as a more stringent measure if they are used in addition to EU aviation security measures or deployed for trials for a limited duration. EU Member States, like the UK, are already deploying security scanners within the limits of this EU legal framework Aviation Security EU legislation as of 29 April 2010: (full application of) Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the Parliament and of the Council of 11.3.2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002, OJ L 970, 9.4.2008; Commission Regulation (EC) No 272/2009 of 2.4.2009 supplementing the basic standards on civil aviation security laid down in the annex to Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the Parliament and the Council, OJ L 97, 3.4.2009; and finally
