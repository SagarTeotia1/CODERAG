firmly of the opinion that the future of transatlantic relations depends crucially on the EU and the US maintaining a commonality of values in foreign policy and on human rights issues and, of course, trade; 6. Takes the view that a unilateral approach to world trade is unsustainable in the long run and hopes therefore that the US will remain as committed to the forthcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations as it has been in the past; 7. Remains deeply concerned by several statements made by President Bush as regards the Kyoto Protocol and recalls that the US has a moral obligation to respect commitments entered into by the Clinton Administration; 8. Takes note of the latest report on climate change, which shows that emissions of greenhouse gases throughout the EU were down by 4% overall on the base year (i.e. halfway to meeting our targeted 8% reduction required by Kyoto), while the US, by contrast, recorded an 11% increase in emissions; 9. Invites the Swedish Presidency in Gothenburg to engage the US in discussions on the NATO/ESDP cooperation and the envisaged missile defence system in the context of an overall strategic defence policy review, as well as efforts to prevent and manage conflicts in theatres of political instability, regional crises and their wider security implications and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; 10. Reiterates its request to the United States for a moratorium on executions with a view to completely abolishing the death penalty; 11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments of the Member States and the US Congress and Administration.
