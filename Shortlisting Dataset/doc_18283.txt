WRITTEN QUESTION E-2046/10 by Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (6 April 2010) Subject: Construction of the Llanera-Avilés section of the AS-III motorway (Asturias, Spain) The Ministry of the Environment, Land Use and Infrastructure of the Principality of Asturias published a resolution in the BOPA (official journal of Asturias) of 8 March 2010 approving the public inquiry procedure for the motorway between Llanera and Avilés. It will shortly publish the preliminary project for the work scheduled for this section of the AS-III motorway. The study for the project favours a route that would cross the village of Solís, a parish in the municipality of Corvera with 443 inhabitants where the main activity is farming. It would also affect the parish of Molleda, and local residents' associations have rejected this route. Furthermore, it would have a serious environmental impact along the river Alvares where it flows through Solís and Cancienes. Is the Commission aware of this motorway project? If not, can it request information on the project from the Spanish authorities? Could the Commission explain, on the basis of the information supplied, why, of the various possible routes, the Ministry of the Environment, Land Use and Infrastructure has opted for the route between Llanera and Avilés? Can the Commission confirm that the environmental impact statement that was drawn up does not merely comply with a formal legal requirement but responds to the objectives of Directive 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5. amending Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40. on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment?
