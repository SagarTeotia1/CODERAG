WRITTEN QUESTION E-3309/05 by María Salinas García (PSE) to the Commission (23 September 2005) Subject: Impact assessment of the cotton reform In the report of Parliament of 27 February 2004 A5-0123/2004 . on the proposal for amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1 . on direct support schemes under the CAP, it was proposed that the Commission should, before 1 January 2006 (i.e. prior to the entry into force of the reform of the raw cotton sector), ‘present its impact study to the Council and the European Parliament, if need be together with a proposal for adjusting the percentage intended for aid per hectare laid down’. The reason for this was that the Commission had not included in its proposal the impact assessment which it had included for other agricultural sectors reformed in 2003 and for tobacco. The Economic and Social Committee, in its report of 26 February 2004 (paragraph 5.8) had also forcibly criticised the absence of an impact assessment. In the face of so deep and substantial a reform of the cotton regime, the impact assessment would have represented a significant guarantee for the Council's decision-making procedure: it would have enabled the Council to carry out an exhaustive risk assessment and provided the technical justification for the measures finally adopted in Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 OJ L 161, 30.4.2004, p. 48 . of 29 April 2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (65 % of aid decoupled from production, 35 % coupled). Without the assessment this has, obviously, not been possible. Parliament expressed the view in its report that the respective parentages of decoupled and coupled aid should be 20 % and 80 %, on the grounds that a high percentage of aid decoupled from production would generate a significant risk of disturbance of production in the Community's producer regions. Parliament also called for the production of raw cotton to be entrusted to ginning enterprises on the basis of the qualitative and quantitative requirements laid down by the Member State concerned, thus taking a position that was manifestly very different from the measures finally adopted by the Council. Does the Commission intend to act on Parliament's request for an impact assessment? Is the Commission considering the possibility of proposing to the Council a modification of the aid per hectare percentages laid down in Regulation (EC) No 864/2004?
