Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2012) 1. In support of the third pillar of the Baltic Sea Strategy and in the context of its recent communication COM(2010)352 final. , the Commission is preparing a roadmap for a strategy on sustainable coastal and marine tourism. It is also encouraging diversification of the European tourism offer (e.g. rural and coastal tourism products) on a transnational and European scale. It is also supporting rural tourism related activities through the Rural Development programmes where Leader measures might also be used. Moreover, the European Fisheries Fund contributes to the sustainable development of fisheries areas through various actions (e.g. diversification of economic activities towards eco-tourism). 2. Within the framework of the Baltic Strategy itself, and the flagship project: ‘Attract tourists to rural areas especially the coastal ones’ a Baltic Sea Coastal and Rural Tourism Network was launched through the Yammer social network platform on 28 October 2011, fostering an exchange of ideas and networking. 3. The project focuses on strengthening cooperation among partners and sharing know-how and best practice and, in 2012, it will concentrate on support for innovation in tourism and ecotourism. 4. It is led by the Regional Council of Southwest Finland in cooperation with Turku Touring (the region’s organisation for tourism) and implemented together with participants from all Baltic Sea Region countries. 5. Currently, funding comes from Southern Finland, to cover staff and travelling costs. For further actions (ie. seminars, workshops) extra funds (EUR 20 000) were allocated by the Finnish ‘Cohesion and Competitiveness programme’. Further funding is covered by lead partners' own funds.
