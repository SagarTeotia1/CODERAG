Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (4 August 2008) 1. The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment, OJ L 135, 30.5.1991. sets out the obligation for waste water collection and treatment for all sufficiently concentrated settlement areas and/or areas of economic activity (‘agglomerations’) with a population of more than 2 000 (or the equivalent in waste water ‘population equivalents’ (p.e.)). Settlement areas below this threshold are as a rule not covered by the directive. 1. Settlement areas addressed in the Honourable Member's question are in their majority outside the scope of the directive because of their small size. Information collated shows that the majority of these small settlements has — beyond the obligations of the directive — been provided with a biological waste water treatment plant, either plants for individual settlements or plants serving several small settlements, and there are further plans for those currently not supplied with treatment plants. — Harlingen is a village of about 600 inhabitants; in terms of political entity, it is part of the municipality of Merzig. The waste water treatment plant at Merzig has been designed to treat in the future also the waste water from Harlingen; however Harlingen village is outside the scope of Directive 91/271/EEC; — Gersheim municipality: 11 parts, with a total population of about 7 200. According to available data, all settlement areas are below a population of 2 000. However, the villages of Bliesdalheim, Rubenheim and Herbitzheim are already connected to the biological waste water treatment plant in the neighbouring municipality of Blieskastel. Peppenkum and Medelsheim have their own biological treatment plant operational. For Gersheim, Walsheim, Niedergailbach and Reinheim (population between 580 and 1 350 each), a joint waste water collection and biological treatment plant is foreseen to go operational during 2008; — Blieskastel municipality: 14 parts, with only three parts (Blieskastel-Mitte, Bierbach and Niederwürzbach) with a population above 2 000. These three settlements are served by a biological treatment plant. Further, the villages of Altheim, Böckweiler, Brenschelbach, Peppenkum, Pinningen and Riesweiler (population between 280 and 1 000) have their own biological treatment plants operational, although they are outside the scope of Directive 91/271/EEC; — Mandelbachtal municipality: 8 parts, with a total population of 11 600. According to available data, only two parts have a population above 2 000 (Ommersheim and Ormesheim). Ommersheim is served by a biological waste water treatment plant, Ormesheim is connected to the biological waste water treatment plant at Eschringen; — Perl — Besch: the waste water treatment plant is designed for 22 000 p.e. (population equivalents), however serving a number of small settlements (Besch, Nennig, Oberperl, Perl and Sehndorf, with a population of between 200 and 1 800 each), plus settlement areas in Luxembourg (Remerschen, Wellenstein and Remich). 1. Situation report by the authorities: Following the 2004 report mentioned by the Honourable Member, a further report has been published in 2006. It is available at http://www.saarland.de/ministerium_umwelt.htm. This report concludes as per 2006 that in their large majority the obligations due by 2005
