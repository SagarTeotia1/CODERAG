Question for written answer E-005028/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) (23 May 2011) Subject: Transmission charging systems in the EU The North of Scotland has the best resources for the generation of renewable energy in the United Kingdom (UK) and, indeed, the European Union. As a result, many renewable generators will be located in this region as part of the push to reach the 2020 renewables target. However, the transmission charges system in the UK includes a strong locational pricing element, with significantly differing charges per region. As such, renewable generators in the North of Scotland are facing the highest charges (around GBP 22/kW) in the UK. These charges could more than double as new transmission infrastructure connecting the North of Scotland to England (the so-called ‘bootstraps’) will be needed to allow new renewable generation in the North of Scotland to connect and generate. Could the Commission give an overview of the top 10 highest transmission charges in the EU in 2010? Does the Commission agree that transmission charges in the North of Scotland are out of step with the rest of the EU? Further, could the Commission give an overview of the biggest range in transmission charges between regions within individual Member States? Does the Commission agree that the range between the highest and lowest transmission charges in the UK is out of step with the ranges found in other EU Member States?
