Question for written answer P-011701/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sylvie Guillaume (S&D) (7 December 2011) Subject: Funding of the DAPHNE programme after 2013 On 15 November 2011 the Commission submitted proposals designed to simplify the funding of programmes under the EU budget over the period from 2014 to 2020. In particular, the Commission would like to consolidate the six existing programmes in the area of justice, fundamental rights and citizenship which have been implemented during the 2007-2013 funding period, including the DAPHNE III programme, into two new programmes, entitled ‘Justice’ and ‘Rights and citizenship’. 1. Given the importance, the successes and the popularity of the DAPHNE programme, whose aim is to combat violence against women, children and young people, can the Commission confirm that this proposal will not lead to a reduction in the budget allocated to the DAPHNE programme after 2013? 2. Given that the name DAPHNE is well known and recognised throughout the EU and beyond, can the Commission confirm that the programme will continue to be promoted under that name, with a view to giving it the highest possible profile after 2013? 3. Finally, can the Commission guarantee that these proposals will not endanger the funding of projects proposed by NGOs and small organisations, whose committed and effective work on the ground is so essential?
