Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (12 June 2009) The Commission does not currently intend to recommend to Member States to consider the costs and benefits of undergrounding electricity lines. The choice of route and technology of electricity lines are generally left to the project promoters which, in turn, have to respect the conditions imposed by the authorities of the countries concerned. Concerning best practice regarding the installation of high-voltage lines in residential areas, the Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC 1999/519/EC: Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300 GHz), OJ L 199, 30.7.1999. on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hertz to 300 Gigahertz) establishes a framework of minimum restrictions and reference levels but the Member States remain responsible for the implementation of the precise measures. In any event, as a result of this legislation, overhead lines have to keep a sufficiently great distance to residential areas. Member States are responsible for the planning and authorisation procedures and have to ensure compliance with environmental legislation, including EU directives, in particular the Birds Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. and Habitats Directives Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . Underground cables are more expensive. Regulators play a key role as they determine the return on investment of electricity lines. When fixing transmission tariffs, the regulators decide whether to acknowledge the extra costs of undergrounding. The Commission has not undertaken any research or studies on the costs and benefits of undergrounding of electricity lines but it has repeatedly invited industry and transmission system operators to study the potential of undergrounding in more depth, including its advantages and disadvantages. Research by other institutions and organisations (such as BirdLife Int) seems to suggest that undergrounding of cables can be beneficial for biodiversity, and in particular for the implementation of the Birds Directive. This is mostly due to avoiding electrocutions and collisions of birds with power lines.
