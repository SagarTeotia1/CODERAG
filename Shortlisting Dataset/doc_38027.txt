on regulatory impact analysis (RIA) and the report on grassroots representation adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 20.9.2000 (CdR 436/2000). ; 28. Is also of the opinion that the development of a dialogue with associations of municipalities should result in municipalities and local authorities being consulted on all Commission plans that affect their interests; Better lawmaking 29. Points out that an intensive exchange of views has been going on between the Union institutions on this subject for years Recent examples include: European Parliament resolution of 4.9.2001 on the Commission's 17th annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (1999) ( COM(2000) 92 ), European Parliament resolution of 3.7.2001 on a draft interinstitutional agreement on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal acts (2037/1/2000REV1 – C5-0588/2000 – 2000/2266(ACI)), European Parliament resolution on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a review of SLIM: Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market ( COM(2000) 104 ), and European Parliament resolution of 26.10.2000 on the Commission reports to the European Council: Better lawmaking - A shared responsibility (1998) ( COM(1998) 815 ) and Better lawmaking 1999 ( COM(1999) 562 ). ; 30. Considers that the drafting of an 'action plan for better regulation' by a Council working party (Mandelkern group on better regulation) and, at the same time, by a Commission working party with a similar brief, represents a serious breach of the Community method, for Parliament, as co-legislator, was neither informed of, nor involved in, the work of these working parties; 31. Calls on the European Council not to adopt the 'Action Plan for Better Regulation' without first consulting the European Parliament; 32. Recalls that, on 2 October 2001, Commission President Prodi assured the European Parliament that the Commission would not present such a plan either to the Laeken European Council or at any other time, without first obtaining Parliament's opinion; calls on the Commission, therefore, not to submit an 'action plan for better regulation', or any other document with the same content but under a different name, to the Laeken European Council before Parliament, as co-legislator, has delivered an opinion; 33. Considers that there are currently no interinstitutional agreements on co-regulation which guarantee Parliament effective exercise of its political role and responsibility, either with regard to the appropriate choice of a legal instrument (while respecting the Commission's right of initiative), or with regard to the form and implementation of a proposed co-regulation; 34. Believes that the use of so-called 'framework' directives must be accompanied by adequate mechanisms of democratic control; in particular, Parliament must in future dispose of a time-limited 'call-back mechanism' for legislation which is delegated; 35. Points out that these methods require further examination and consideration in Parliament and should be regulated by an interinstitutional agreement; if the Commission assumes that co-regulation 'should not be used in situations where rules need to apply in a uniform way in every Member State' then its scope of application is unlikely to be very wide; in no circumstances however should it be allowed to
