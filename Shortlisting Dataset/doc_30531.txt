Stresses that, as regards the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements, the Commission will be under a legal obligation to inform Parliament of the progress of negotiations in the same way as the special committee designated by the Council as referred to in Article 218 of the TFEU; calls for this information to be provided to the same extent, and at the same time, as it is supplied to the relevant Council committee under that article; New rights of initiative 60. Welcomes Parliament's new role in initiating amendments to the Treaties; will make use of this right and put forward new ideas for the future of Europe, when new challenges make this necessary; 61.

Welcomes in particular the provisions of Article 290(2) of the TFEU, which envisages Parliament (and the Council) having the right both to revoke the delegation of powers and to object to individual delegated acts; 68.
