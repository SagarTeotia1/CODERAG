WRITTEN QUESTION E-2368/04 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (7 October 2004) Subject: Recognition of diplomas awarded by Free Study Centres in Greece Seven months ago, a debate took place in Greece about the recognition of diplomas awarded by the ‘Free Study Centres’, which have been operating for years with the authorisation of the Greek Government and at which thousands of Greeks are studying. Representatives of these Centres maintain that the diplomas they award could, by way of appropriate procedures and adjustments, acquire equal value to those awarded by public institutions of higher education. The New Democracy party (then in opposition, now in government) took a favourable view of this possible development. Does the Commission know what stage has been reached in this matter? Has it received any information from the Greek Government on this subject, which concerns thousands of Greek families? A solution to this problem could also bring relief to the hard-pressed Greek economy which has suffered from a tremendous outflow of currency for decades as a result of thousands of Greeks studying in third countries. Is the Commission satisfied with the steps taken by the previous and current governments to bring Greece into line with current Community legislation in this respect?
