WRITTEN QUESTION E-3998/09 by Syed Kamall (ECR) to the Commission (5 August 2009) Subject: Baha'i in Iran I have been contacted by constituents seeking assistance regarding the increased risk to the lives of their relatives and fellow Baha’i in Iran. I am informed that the situation for Baha’i in Iran has deteriorated. I am told that at least 34 Baha’i have now been in prison for one year or longer, that no charges have ever been formalised, and no court date has ever been announced. I am also informed that families of the seven Baha’i ‘leaders’ imprisoned in Tehran have now been told that a new charge, spreading corruption on earth, may be added to previous accusations, which could result in capital punishment under Iran’s penal code. Can the Commission confirm: 1. if it is aware of the situation of the Baha'i in Iran? 2. what action the Commission plans to take in order to alleviate this situation?
