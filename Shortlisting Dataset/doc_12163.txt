Joint answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-5383/06 , P-5388/06 (9 February 2007) The Commission refers the Honourable Members to the joint reply given to previous Written Questions P‑4666/06 from Mr Battilocchio and P‑5186/06 from Ms Angelilli. As far as the roaming regulation is concerned, the Commission would like to draw the Honourable Members' attention to the fact that the regulation will relate to the wholesale international roaming tariffs (i.e. the price which has influence on the price a customer pays for using a mobile phone abroad). While consumers may decide on their own initiative to purchase a subscriber identity module (SIM) card from any other operator in a different Member State, this is not within the scope of the regulation. The framework directive Directive 2002/21/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, OJ L 108, 24.4.2002. already obliges national regulatory authorities (NRAs) to carry out an analysis of the markets indicated by the Commission in its recommendation of 11 February 2003 C(2003)497. . Among the 18 product and service markets in which ex-ante regulation may be warranted, there are three mobile networks markets.
