ORAL QUESTION H-0143/07 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou to the Council Subject: Illegal immigrants and European policy In recent months, there has been an alarming increase in the wave of illegal immigrants arriving in Greece, on the islands of the eastern Aegean, from Turkey. In 2006, 20% of the illegal immigrants arrested came from Turkey (as opposed to 15.5% in 2004 and 11.9% in 2005). Greece and Turkey signed a Readmission Protocol in April 2002 and, over the period as a whole, the Greek authorities have submitted applications to Turkey in respect of 22 945 illegal immigrants arrested, only 1419 of which have been repatriated. In its report (November 2006) on Turkey’s progress towards accession, the Commission notes in regard to negotiating Chapter 24 (Justice, Freedom and Security) that Turkey has made little progress in tackling illegal immigration and that a tremendous effort is needed to bring the country into line with the Community acquis. Does the Council intend to take initiatives to speed up the necessary reforms and their correct application by Turkey in this specific area? There is also a significant problem with the cost of transporting illegal immigrants. Does the Council consider that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the external borders of the Member States of the European Union, could use Community financial means to tackle these specific problems on the basis of Article 9 (Return cooperation) of its founding Regulation (EC) No. 2007/2004 ? 1 OJ L 349, 25.11.2004, p. 1.
