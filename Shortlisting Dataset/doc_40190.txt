WRITTEN QUESTION P-4619/08 by Charles Tannock (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 August 2008) Subject: The alleged kidnapping and forced conversion to Islam of two Christian minor sisters in Pakistan It has been brought to my attention of the distressing case in Pakistan of two minor Christian girls Saba Younas (aged 13) and Anila Younas (aged 10) who on 26th June in Chak Sarwar Shaheed were allegedly abducted by a Muhammad Arif Bajwa who handed them to Falak Sher Gill who married Saba to his son. In court the father and son claimed that the girls had freely converted to Islam as officiated by a Mulavi (muslim cleric) and therefore cannot be handed back to the custody of their Christian father, even though the 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act of Pakistan bans such child marriages and forced religious conversions and marriages are against various international conventions on the rights of the child which Pakistan has ratified. Sadly Mr Sagheer Ahmed, a Judge in the Lahore High Court, has ordered that the girls be placed in the care of a house for destitute women (Dar-Ul-Aman) as they cannot be returned to their Christian parents as the girls are now Muslims having ‘freely’ converted to Islam even though these were under age conversions and according to the family forced upon the two sisters. The only way the parents can regain custody of their daughters is that they themselves convert to Islam. Is the Commission through its delegation in Islamabad aware of this tragic story and what action will it take to raise with the government of Pakistan this particular case and more generally the issue of child and religious minority rights?
