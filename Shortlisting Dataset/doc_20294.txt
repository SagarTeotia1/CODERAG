EMPL Welcome words Welcome to the website of the EMPL Committee of which I am the chair. The EMPL Committee is mainly responsible for employment policies and all aspects of social policy, working conditions, vocational training and the free movement of workers and pensioners. There is a full list of our powers and responsibilities below. The committee consists of 50 full and 50 substitute members representing the various political families in the European Parliament. Each political group appoints a coordinator to take part in organising the committee's work. The EMPL Committee works with the Council of the Union and the European Commission to implement the legislative framework in the areas for which it is responsible. During the current parliamentary term, the committee is seeking to drive forward a new Social Agenda and to contribute to promoting a more inclusive society. Our site is updated regularly to keep you informed of our committee's activities. You can also follow our meetings online via EPLive. Enjoy your visit!
