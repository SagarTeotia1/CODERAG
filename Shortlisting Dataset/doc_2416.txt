that excluded sectors, like older and disabled people, are included". As well as having full wheelchair access the yellow truck has a Braille guide that allows visually impaired people to access information on its website (see the link below). It also has another novel feature to create awareness of the barrier disabled people face: visitors can sit in a wheelchair and navigate obstacles. Visitors can also try to identify sounds, smells and everyday objects using limited senses. As well as these there will be song contests, poster exhibitions and quiz shows in the truck. See the truck online and in person if you want.
