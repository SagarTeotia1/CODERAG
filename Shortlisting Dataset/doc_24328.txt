Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (26 April 2011) Directive 2005/36/EC aims to facilitate the free movement of professionals between the Member States of the EU. It does not itself regulate professions, either by setting the level of standards required for access to a profession, or otherwise; this is left to Member States' discretion. For architects, mobility has been facilitated through harmonisation of minimum training requirements. Architects whose qualifications meet these requirements can benefit from automatic recognition in a Member State other than that in which they acquired these qualifications. As the training requirements defined in the directive for the purposes of recognition between Member States are only the minimum, Member States may apply higher standards internally. The Honourable Member will find further clarification of the functioning of the automatic recognition mechanism for architects under Directive 2005/36/EC in the response to the Written Question E‑000852/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB .
