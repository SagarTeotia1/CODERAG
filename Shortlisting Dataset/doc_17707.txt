Question for written answer E-002615/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Laurence J.A.J. Stassen (NI) (7 March 2012) Subject: Aviation sector harmed as a result of European CO 2 tax The Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis (KiM) has published dramatic figures about the harm that the European CO 2 tax (Emissions Trading System — ETS) will do to Schiphol airport and KLM Airlines. Two hundred jobs are under threat at Schiphol and KLM is facing a decrease of at least 150 000 in the number of passengers it carries this year, and all because of the European CO 2 tax on the aviation sector, which the EU is trying to push through in the face of worldwide resistance. In the meantime, Minister of State Atsma (Infrastructure) has issued a warning that the ETS should be shelved if it gives rise to unfair competition De Telegraaf , 6 March 2012 — ‘Vliegtaks EU nekt Schiphol’ [EU flight tax upsets Schiphol]. . 1. Is the Commission aware of the shocking results of this investigation? 2. Does the Commission agree with Minister of State Atsma that unfair competition should result in the ETS being dropped? If not, why not? 3. Has the Commission considered the scenario whereby the introduction of the CO 2 tax is not matched by similar measures outside Europe and the damage that this would do to the European aviation sector? 4. Can the Commission indicate what plan B is now that the CO 2 tax looks set to cause a trade war with damaging effects on the European aviation sector? 5. Does the Commission agree with the PVV that it is completely unacceptable for Schiphol and KLM to be the victims of the introduction of the CO 2 tax? If not, why not?
