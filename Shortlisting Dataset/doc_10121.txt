Among the recommendations in the accompanying resolution - adopted by 436 votes in favour, 34 against and 48 abstentions - were increasing the accountability for the use of funds allocated to the political groups, reviewing the MEPs' allowances system and introducing a smoking ban in all public places in Parliament's buildings. Parliament regretted the failure by the Council to approve a Statute for Members, but said this did not relieve Parliament of its responsibility for ensuring that EU funds are spent in a honest and transparent manner. It referred to the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors that there should be no difference between the travel expenses paid out by Parliament and actual costs incurred by a Member. It therefore called upon its Bureau (which takes decisions on internal financial, administrative and organisational matters) urgently to adopt new rules for the payment of expenses and allowances such as drafted provisionally in May 2003, including the reimbursement of travel expenses on the basis of costs actually incurred. Parliament noted that steps have been taken to ensure that the attendance registers available for signature by Members are supervised by an official at all times. The Bureau should also bring the rules governing the use of money intended to cover the expenditure by political groups more closely into line with the provisions of the Financial Regulation. Any derogation from the Financial Regulation should be based on sound legal and practical considerations. MEPs in the committee are also calling for accountability to be tightened up in cases where Parliament's political authorities take decisions with significant financial consequences.

MEPs stressed the need for a more comprehensive exchange of information with the Council on its budget expenditure. They welcomed the Council's proposal for an informal dialogue in the course of the discharge procedure. MEPs had been upset that, unlike last year, the Council had refused this year to reply to the questions sent to it by the committee. In the case of the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice,
