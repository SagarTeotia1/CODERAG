Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2005) The Commission is not aware of the intended conversion of the power station of Torre Valdaliga Nord, Civitavecchia, from oil to coal. The conversion from oil to coal obviously entails an increase in emissions for this specific plant. This conversion does not violate the Kyoto Protocol as this imposes only obligations at the country level. Nor does it violate the emissions trading scheme, as long as the installation in question surrenders each year an amount of allowances equivalent to its increased Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The amount of allowances provided to individual installations is to be fixed in the national allocation plan. Regarding the specific situation of the Italian national allocation plan, the Commission has not yet made its final decision, i.e. whether it accepts or rejects the Italian national allocation plan on the basis of compatibility with Article 10 and the criteria specified in Annex III of Directive 2003/87/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC.
