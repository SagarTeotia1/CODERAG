Answer given by Mr Bolkestein on behalf of the Commission (1 December 2003) Under the settled case law of the Court of Justice, in the absence of harmonisation of a particular professional activity Member States are in principle entitled to regulate the exercise of that activity, provided they respect the basic freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaty (Judgment of 11 July 2002, Case C-294/00, Deutsche Paracelsus Schulen für Naturheilverfahren GmbH v. Kurt Gräbner). According to the information available to the Commission, there is no exact Austrian equivalent of the profession of clinical optometrist as it exists in other Member States. In Austria this activity appears to be reserved for doctors. In its Bouchoucha and Mac Quen judgments (Judgments of 3 October 1990, Case C-61/89, and 1 February 2001, Case C-108/96), the Court of Justice stated that a Member State was not in breach of Article 43 of the EC Treaty if it introduced such a restriction on grounds of the general interest in the protection of public health. In this connection, it should also be pointed out that according to Article 46(1) of the EC Treaty the protection of public health is one of the grounds which can justify restrictions on the freedom of establishment. Under Article 55 of the Treaty, the provisions of Article 46(1) also apply to the freedom to provide services. The Commission is not in possession of any further information which would establish an infringement of Community law.
