WRITTEN QUESTION E-0772/05 by Christoph Konrad (PPE-DE) to the Commission (2 March 2005) Subject: Systematic disregard by the German Federal Government of the Schengen Agreement 1. Can the Commission rule out the possibility that Germany failed to comply with its obligations as a contracting party to the Schengen Agreement - and in particular the rules relating to the ‘Common Consular Instructions’ - in implementing the German Visa Decree (Fischer/Volmer Decree), in particular as far as the granting of visas by the German embassy in Kiev between 1999 and 2003 is concerned? 2. When and how did the Commission first learn of these German practices for granting visas, and what was its reaction? Have discussions and/or meetings been held - and, if so, when and in what form - with the German authorities, in order to address the disastrous consequences of German visa policy? 3. Has the Commission received complaints - even informal ones - from other EU Member States that have been harmed by the German policy on the granting of visas? 4. What knowledge does the Commission have, with respect to the Schengen area, concerning the whereabouts of people (between 1999 and 2005 some 1.2 million from Kiev alone) who entered the EU (Schengen area) using negligently‑granted German visas? 5. In the light of the German visa policy referred to above and the committee of enquiry set up by the German Bundestag, will the Commission be opening its own investigation? 6. How does the Commission intend to ensure that the principles of uniform asylum and immigration procedures which it is aimed to introduce are reliably implemented in future, including in Germany?
