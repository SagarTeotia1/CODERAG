WRITTEN QUESTION E-4524/07 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) and Giusto Catania (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (26 September 2007) Subject: Use of helmets and straitjackets in repatriating immigrants in Spain Last week, the press reported that the Spanish Government will allow the use of straitjackets and helmets to immobilise illegal immigrants who display physical resistance while being repatriated by air. This measure forms part of a new repatriation protocol drawn up by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior to establish what steps the police should take in such cases. The draft of the Spanish Protocol contradicts Council Decision 2004/573/EC OJ L 261, 6.8.2004, p. 5. which lays down that ‘any coercive measures should not compromise or threaten the ability of the returnee to breathe normally. In the event that coercive force is used, it shall be ensured that the chest of the returnee remains in upright position and that nothing affects his or her chest in order to maintain normal respiratory function’. Furthermore, the same Decision clearly states that ‘the immobilisation of resisting returnees may be achieved by means of restraint that will not endanger their dignity and physical integrity’. In view of the Spanish Government's intention of adopting its repatriation protocol: — does the Commission not think that the Spanish Protocol does not guarantee the respect of the immigrants' rights, by endangering their health during the return flight? — How does the Commission intend to guarantee that all measures relating to the repatriation of immigrants conform to the procedures set out in Council Decision 2004/573/EC?
