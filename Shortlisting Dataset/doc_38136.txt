Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (29 November 2005) The FLEGT licensing scheme is a new and as yet untested approach to controlling the trade in illegally-harvested timber. The scheme depends on the ability to track timber from point of harvest, through processing mills, and onwards to the port of export. The Commission believes that it is important to begin this innovative new scheme with a practical range of products, for which the origins can be confidently established. Furthermore, products like furniture, pulp and paper can be manufactured from a mix of raw material from different sources, including different countries, in order to meet market tastes and technical qualities. Including these products would therefore risk prejudicing the interests of countries which are not partners in a FLEGT agreement , something the Commission has sought to avoid in order to ensure compatibility with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Tracking timber as it moves through further transformations into higher value products becomes significantly more complex and costly. Moreover, in the case of paper, about half of the EU production is from recovered paper for which material tracking is even more complicated. For these reasons, the Commission has focused on a range of products subject to minimum processing in the first instance. Provisions have been built into the licensing scheme to allow the product coverage to be expanded — in agreement with partner countries. After considerable debate, the approach proposed by the Commission was supported by the Council in October 2005.
