which to raise any objections. In this context, any ongoing infringement action for the directives listed in the directive 2008/50/EC Annex XV B(2) will be specifically assessed by the Commission. Objection will be considered if an adverse effect on the concentration levels of the pollutant in question in the notified zone can be identified. Equal treatment in relation to time extensions will be ensured by applying a consistent assessment methodology supported also by external technical assessment, continuous quality control, regular meetings with the Member States under the Committee's Working Group on time extensions, and through the transparency of the decisions made Last meeting of the Working Group on time extensions 7 October 2008. Constantly updated information on the notification process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/time_extensions.htm . The Commission expects that all measures will be implemented as set out in the notification and that any changes will be communicated to the Commission. Changes to measures are only acceptable if they result in equivalent or greater abatement than originally indicated and that fulfilment of the objectives stated in the notification is not compromised. The Commission will monitor progress of air quality concentration levels through the official annual reporting. Quality and comprehensiveness of reporting will continue to be addressed through implementation mechanisms such as regular meetings of the Aquila network of national reference laboratories and Directive 2008/50/EC Committee Working group on data exchange, and through the exchange under Eionet.
