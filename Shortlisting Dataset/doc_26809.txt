Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2012) No, the Commission is not considering introducing a similar tax in the EU. As regards the possible application of equivalent measures by Member States, it may be noted that Member States have broad freedom to design their tax systems, including in the area of taxation of capital gains. In the exercise of their taxation rights, Member States must respect their obligations under the Treaties and are therefore not allowed to discriminate on the basis of nationality or to apply unjustified restrictions to the exercise of the fundamental Treaty freedoms. However, within these parameters, Member States remain free to design their direct tax systems (including the level of the threshhold for paying income taxes) in the most appropriate way in order to meet their domestic policy objectives.
