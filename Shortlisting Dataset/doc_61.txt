WRITTEN QUESTION E-2552/05 by Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (14 July 2005) Subject: Microcredit programmes in third countries 2005 is Microfinance Year. Although microcredit is a development tool, devised and applied for over 30 years by NGOs, and recognised by professionals as an effective means of combating poverty, the Commission has apparently decided to stop using it or, more precisely, to stop allowing subsidies granted to NGOs for integrated projects under Community aid programmes to be used to finance microcredit operations. Will Commissioner Michel state whether this decision was taken following a thorough evaluation of the Commission's activities (and over what period)? Will he also state since when the Member States have opposed this decision within the Management Committee on NGO co-financing and how the Commission intends to respond to this opposition? Can the Commission give details of the legal entities (banks, funds, NGOs) it has supported since 2001 under microcredit programmes in third countries and provide a reliable description of the microcredit portfolios (number, size, rate and risk of non-reimbursement of microcredits) of these entities? Lastly, will Commissioner Michel and the services over which he has political responsibility undertake to respect the opinions they request on the planning and implementation of actions supported by the Commission to ensure that it cannot be accused of ‘political autism’?
