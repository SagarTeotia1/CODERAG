WRITTEN QUESTION E-1990/04 by Raül Romeva Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (13 September 2004) Subject: Nitrate pollution from aquaculture and urban sewage outfalls on the coast of the Canary Islands and the application of European directives Council Directive 91/271/EEC OJ L 135, 30.5.1991, p.40 . of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment, as amended by Commission Directive 98/15/EC OJ L 67, 7.3.1998, p. 29 . of 27 February 1998, requires Member States to identify areas on their territory that are sensitive to this kind of pollution. Member States may also identify less sensitive areas in certain coastal and estuarial waters that, owing to their morphology, hydrology and specific hydraulic conditions, are suitable for receiving urban waste-water discharges that have undergone treatment less stringent than secondary treatment without any damage to the environment. According to the Commission, all Spanish agglomerations of more than 15000 people were to have at least one secondary treatment plant by 31 December 2000, including those that discharge effluent to areas identified as less sensitive by the Spanish authorities. The urban agglomerations that have emerged with the growth of tourism on the southern coasts of the Canary Islands have brought about an increase in the number of offshore sewage outfalls, making the strict enforcement of these directives necessary. Can the Commission provide information on the level of sensitivity of the area around the Canary Islands with regard to these directives and on the Spanish authorities' compliance with the latter? Has the Commission carried out or does it intend to carry out an inspection to confirm that these directives are being observed as regards the discharge of urban waste water through outfalls along the coast of the Canary Islands?
