Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (20 November 2008) The Commission is aware of the European Court of Human Rights judgment mentioned by the Honourable Member. Further to an application lodged by a family who are followers of Alevism, the Court found that the compulsory religious education classes in Turkey did not just give a general overview of religions but provided specific instruction in the major principles of the Muslim faith, including its cultural rites. The Court requested Turkey to bring its educational system and domestic legislation into conformity with Article 2 of Protocol No1 to the European Convention of Human Rights. This judgment needs to be implemented. The Commission has been raising these issues in its contacts with the Turkish authorities at all appropriate levels. As regards financial assistance, conditionality is in principle linked to specific projects and relates to concrete actions the country's authorities need to take in order to maximise the impact of the project. The execution of the European Court of Human Rights judgments is followed by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.
