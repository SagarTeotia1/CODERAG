WRITTEN QUESTION E-2947/06 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (4 July 2006) Subject: Complaints by the Greek Association of Imported Car Dealers to the Hellenic Competition Commission and to the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition In a letter to the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition (A/00091, 22 December 2004), the Greek Association of Imported Car Dealers (SEEAE) lodged a complaint concerning failure to implement Community competition law in the car trading market in Greece. In its answer (D/000627, 4 February 2005), the Commission considers that, as a similar complaint has been made to the Hellenic Competition Commission and in view of the local interest of the matter, it would be preferable that it be examined by the Hellenic Competition Commission. It is also stated in the letter that, after the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition had contacted the Hellenic Competition Commission, the latter confirmed that it would examine the matter. Three years have already passed since the SEEAE made its initial complaint (2647/ 17 July 2003) to the Hellenic Competition Commission, which has not looked into the matter. Since the businesses making the complaints are suffering serious problems as a result of the alleged infringement of Community legislation, will the Commission examine the abovementioned complaints immediately? What action does it propose to take to put an end to practices ensuing from a dominant position which are applied on the car market in Greece ?
