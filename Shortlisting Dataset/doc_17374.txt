Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (7 October 2010) 1. The Europe 2020 strategy has put forward three mutually reinforcing priorities on smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Under each priority theme the so-called ‘flagship initiatives’ will catalyse progress. In this framework, regional and smaller airports will be mainly concerned by the objectives and developments in terms of sustainable growth, in particular through the flagship initiative on a ‘resource efficient Europe’. This flagship initiative underlines the need to modernise and decarbonise the transport sector, including the reduction of CO 2 emissions for the aviation sector. It aims at developping intelligent traffic management and promote new technologies while contributing to increased competitiveness which is a key feature for regional and smaller airports in order to continue providing accessibility and potential for growth. 2. The Europe 2020 strategy represents a genuine opportunity for regional and smaller airports to increase their sustainability while deploying innovative technologies and systems to boost their competitiveness. The development of integrated and sustainable local transport networks, including the access to regional airports, the improvement of the energy efficiency and overall sustainability of buildings and ground operations as well as further use of renewable energies will also benefit the local and regional economies in terms of sustainable growth. The strategy is designed to provide a framework in which Member States and the regions pursue opportunities while responding to the Sustainable Development.
