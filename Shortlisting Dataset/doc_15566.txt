(15 04 44). The completion of previous programmes in the field of culture and language in 2006 had an amount of 38.086m on the line. Furthermore 3m would be reserved in 2007 for the preparation of European Year for Intercultural Dialogue in 2008 (15 04 47). For the programme Youth in action (15 05 55) the PDB has reserved commitments of 114.768 for operational expenditure. The line on the completion of previous programmes in the field of youth in 2006 had an amount of 111.965 m. The new programme Citizens for Europe (15 06 66) will include support to civil society and town twinning. The 2007 PDB proposes 19.339m for commitments for operational expenditure. The completion of previous programmes in the field of civic participation in 2006 had committed 23.864m. 7. Policy area 16 - Communication and information policy The commitment appropriations in the 2007 PDB for this policy increase of 3.61% compared to 2006. In this area, the culture and education committee has a key interest in the follow up and implementation of the Action plan to improve Communicating Europe, the Plan D for Democracy Dialogue and Debate and the White Paper on a European Communication Policy. 8. Policy area 26 - Administration The 2007 PDB proposes an overall increase for commitments in this area of 4.11% compared to 2006. Within this area, there is a separate budget line for each European school (from 26 01 50 11 to 26 01 50 25). 9. The Draft Budget The rapporteur has taken note of the changes adopted by the Council in the Draft Budget (DB). The Council proposes an overall reduction of 0.8% in commitments and of 1.5% in payments compared to the PDB. The reductions would be more relevant for some policy areas, including those of interest for the culture and education Committee. Within the first heading ("competitiveness for growth and employment"), the budget lines related to education and culture would be reduced of 2%. This would affect (in commitments) in particular Lifelong Learning (-17.101 m), Erasmus Mundus (-1.158m). Also the budget line on eContent plus - promotion of the European digital content would be severely cut (-1.370m). Within the heading "Citizenship, freedom, security and justice", both actions run by DG EAC (-0.7% in commitments) and by DG COM (-5.5%!) would be affected. Commitments for the programme Culture 2007 would be reduced by -1.4m (-0.531 payments). Budget lines on "Local actions" and on "specific actions on priority themes, of which Prince" would be drastically reduced of -2m each (both for commitments and for payments). The DB reduces the heading related to administration by 1.8% in total compared to the PDB. This would affect significantly services for the information society (-3.5%), education and culture (-2.9%), press and communication (-2.1%), language services (-3.1%). The rapporteur underlines that the changes proposed by the Council in the different headings for the issues of competence of the culture and education committee are not acceptable. In particular, this committee has stressed several times that the amount proposed in the PDB for the co-decided programs in the culture
