WRITTEN QUESTION P-5512/06 by Giusto Catania (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (12 December 2006) Subject: EU general programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ The European Parliament is currently discussing the proposal COM(2005)123 final regarding a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the External Borders Fund for the period 2007‑13 as part of the General programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’. In the context of this proposal the following question has been raised: Should the purchase of firearms or any other types of weapons be excluded from the scope of the funding supported by this programme or not? Can the Commission state whether any of the European funds or programmes have contributed to financing or subsidising, wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, the purchase of fire arms or any other types of weapons for military and/or civilian purposes by any of the 25 EU Member States? If there has been such financing, can the Commission state what amount of money has been used for this purpose and how were the funds distributed? Can the Commission confirm that no future purchase of firearms or any other type of weapons will be supported, wholly or partly, by EU funds?
