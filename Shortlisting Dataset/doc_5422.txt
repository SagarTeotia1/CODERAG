Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (9 April 2008) The Commission is aware of these reports on the situation in Orissa. After learning of them in December 2007, the Commission raised in Brussels with Indian counterparts the concern felt in Europe over violence aimed at minorities. The Commission had the opportunity to express its concern over this issue and receive an update from their Indian interlocutors on their appraisal of the intercommunal situation during the annual EU‑India Human Rights Dialogue in February 2008. The National Commission for Minorities (NCM), government body, has issued a comprehensive report on the situation that includes a useful set of recommendations. Indian officials are aware of the importance of pursuing justice in this situation, but have made it clear to us that the State Government of Orisssa is responsible for pursuing the case. The Commission's Delegation in Delhi is following the issue and whether the NCM recommendations are implemented.
