WRITTEN QUESTION E-3233/04 by Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (7 December 2004) Subject: Baby seal slaughter in the Russian Federation Seal pups (less than one month old) are slaughtered in the most inhumane manner in the Russian Federation. Those that are not killed directly on the ice by clubbing are delivered to seal farms as part of the ongoing fur production system. The most recent figures show that in 2001 39 106 seals were slaughtered. What plans does the Commission have to raise this issue with President Putin at the EU-Russia Summit? Following the summit, what steps will the Commission take to persuade the Russian Federation to end the slaughter of seal pups?
