Question for Question Time H-0354/2010 to the Commission Part-session: September I 2010 Rule 116 Silvia-Adriana Ţicău (S&D) Subject: Measures to fight drought and desertification Climate change is affecting the Member States in dramatic fashion, with many of them now having to handle long heatwaves, prolonged drought and large-scale desertification. This seriously affects agriculture and economic development in the regions concerned. The EU needs its southern and eastern Member States to develop comprehensive irrigation systems and reforestation programmes if desertification and drought are to be fought effectively. Can the Commission state what measures for adaptation to climate change it will propose in order to support the EU's southern and eastern Member States in their fight against drought and desertification? Can the Commission also provide information on the funding sources for each measure proposed by it?
