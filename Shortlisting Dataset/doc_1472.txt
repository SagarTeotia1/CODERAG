ORAL QUESTION H-0489/09 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Harlem Désir to the Council Subject: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) At the 'Protect, Respect, Remedy' conference in Stockholm on 10 and 11 November 2009, the current Presidency and the future Spanish Presidency called on the European Union and the Member States to take the lead in CSR. In March 2007, Parliament asked for a mechanism to be put in place to make it easier for victims of corporate abuse to bring damages claims against companies in European courts. It also asked that the responsibility of company directors be extended to include the duty to minimise the negative impact of their activities on the environment and human rights and that clear reporting standards be implemented at an international level. In its statement, the Council underlined the progress made but also recommended working within a common framework explicitly mentioning the state's responsibility to protect and ensuring that human rights be respected by the corporate world and penalties imposed in the event of violations. What binding legal instruments does the Council propose to ensure that companies respect the principles of due diligence and reporting and are punished in the event of violations of human or environmental rights within their area of responsibility?
