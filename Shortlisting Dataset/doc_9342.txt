Joint answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-3698/10 , E-3850/10 (7 July 2010) The ash cloud crisis showed the crucial importance of a better integration of the EU airspace management through the Single European Sky (SES). The Commission has recommended on 27 April 2010 to accelerate its implementation and the Council has supported this approach in its extraordinary meeting on 4 May 2010. A number of actions have been identified to accelerate this process: — Establishment of a European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell, effective as of 11 May 2010. — Designation of a Functional Airspace Blocks coordinator, for which Mr Jarzembowski's nomination was endorsed by the Single Sky Committee on 7 May 2010. — Accelerated implementation of the Functional Airspace Blocks by the Member States. — Appointment of the European network manager by the end of 2010. — Adoption of the European Performance Scheme before end of 2010, the Single Sky Committee having endorsed the Commission's proposal on 7 May 2010. — Acceleration of the implementation of the European Aviation Safety Agency's (EASA) new competences in the air traffic management field. — Adoption of the Single European Sky ATM Research Programme (SESAR) deployment strategy by the end of 2010. Moreover, the Commission is coordinating a working group to assess new approaches in the evaluation of risks. On this basis, the Commission will make proposals to adapt and develop a better integrated and more coherent approach for safety risk assessment and risk management in relation to the closure and reopening of airspace. In addition the Commission is proactively engaged in discussions and activities facilitated through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), in order to seek harmonised solutions at a global level. The Commission will prepare a European paper in view of the September 2010 ICAO general Assembly.
