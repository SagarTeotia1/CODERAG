Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (19 October 2004) The United Kingdom made its request to the Commission on 30 July 2004. Written comments were subsequently submitted, within the given deadline of five working days following the request, by France and Spain. The Commission considers that, at present, it is inappropriate to set a priori a level of bycatch that would lead to propose the closure of the fisheries concerned. Mitigating the impact of bycatch on cetacean populations may be achieved through different means that need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account in particular the scientific information available, the nature and level of the threat and the cost-efficiency and the proportionality of the possible measures with regard to the desired objective. The Commission is keeping this issue under review and will shortly be discussing ways of achieving lower by-catches of cetaceans in the fisheries concerned with the Member States.
