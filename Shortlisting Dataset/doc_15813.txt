Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2011) The Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe COM(2010)245 final. , the first of the seven flagship initiatives under the EU 2020 strategy, recognises that Europe is suffering from a growing professional ICT skills shortage and a digital literacy deficit. As a result, many citizens are excluded from the digital society and economy and ICT may in turn not generate the expected productivity gains and societal benefits across Europe. The Digital Agenda addresses this problem through targeted measures aiming at increasing digital literacy in Europe and making online services more accessible. Overcoming the persistent fragmentation and creating a single European digital market is the overarching objective of the Digital Agenda. With the Telecoms Reform adopted in 2009, the ePrivacy Directive Directive 2002/58/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002. , together with the other Directives constituting the electronic communications framework, was amended. Member States have until 25 May 2011 to transpose the amended rules into national law. The Commission is currently finalising the evaluation of Directive 2006/24/EC Directive 2006/24/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public electronic communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC, OJ L 105, 13.4.2006. on data retention. A proposal revising the directive may be adopted in 2011. As stated in the Digital Agenda for Europe, the Commission will propose a revision of the electronic signature directive to provide a legal framework for cross-border recognition and interoperability of secure electronic authentication systems. To this end, it will launch a public consultation early in 2011 to gather stakeholders' views on the situation of electronic signature in Europe.
