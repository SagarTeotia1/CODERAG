Reply (12 October 2009) The Council assumes that the Honourable Member is referring to the ongoing consultations relating to boilers, led by the Commission, of Member States and stakeholders under Articles 15(4) and 18 of the Ecodesign of Energy Using Products Directive Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products and amending Council Directive 92/42/EEC and Directives 96/57/EC and 2000/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, OJ L 191, 22.7.2005, p. 29. , that could lead to the adoption of an implementing measure concerning such products as provided for by Article 15 of the Ecodesign Directive. It is therefore up to the Commission to decide if and when it will present a draft implementing measure to that effect and to consider the appropriateness, in that context, of a derogation as advocated by the Honourable Member. Only then will the Council be called upon to decide on the proposal, if it is not accepted by the Committee established in conformity with Article 19 of the directive. In that event, the Council will, in its deliberations on the proposal of the Commission, of which the European Parliament will also be informed, take due account of the information provided by the Honourable Member.
