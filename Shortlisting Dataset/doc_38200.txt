Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2011) The technical arrangement (TA) of 2005 Official Journal of the European Union 25.1.2005, C 20/2. that the Honourable member refers to, provides for the indication of the place of production on all preferential proofs of origin issued in Israel for exports to the EU, thus allowing the customs authorities of the Member States to apply the rules of origin of Protocol 4 to the EU‑Israel Association Agreement on rules of origin. Custom authorities are therefore able to identify those goods which originate in Israel and, which qualify for preferential duty, as opposed to those coming from the settlement areas, which are subject to non-preferential duties. Although the customs authorities of Member States are responsible for the effective implementation of this TA, the EU has conducted three monitoring missions over a two-year period (1.2.2005‑31.1.2007) in order to assess its correct implementation. No evidence has been found to conclude that the TA is not working satisfactorily. In addition, the Commission understands that the necessary instruments are in place for the TA to be implemented by the Israeli customs authorities according to the rules. Internal guidelines were issued by the Israeli customs when the TA became applicable, thus ensuring that their exporters/manufacturers operating within the Green Line treat materials from the settlements as third country materials, i.e. non originating. Apart from these ‘ad hoc’ monitoring exercises, customs authorities of Member States may proceed to post verification requests of any proof of origin in case of doubts in accordance with Article 33 of the protocol on rules of origin. The Commission believes that the TA continues to serve its principal purpose, granting tariff treatment to originating products which are eligible for it.
