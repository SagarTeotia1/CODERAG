ORAL QUESTION H-0057/07 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Athanasios Pafilis to the Council Subject: Provocative pro-Nazi policy by the Estonian authorities In Estonia a law on protecting war graves was recently adopted and entered into force in record time. Its purpose is essentially to destroy Soviet monuments and remove the remains of Soviet soldiers who fell in the fight against Nazism. This law, which seeks the historical vindication of all those who collaborated with the Nazis in Estonian SS legions, has already been condemned by many personalities and organisations in Europe, such as the International Federation of Resistance Fighters (FIR) - Association of Anti-Fascists. A few days later in the Estonian Parliament a debate began on a bill seeking to ban the public use of symbols of the Communist and workers' movement, such as the hammer and sickle. Will the Council say whether it condemns the pro-Nazi and anti-Communist policy of the Estonian authorities? Does it agree to the banning of Communist symbols by Estonia, especially since Communist parties are now legal and are represented in parliaments in many EU countries? What measures will it take to prevail upon the Estonian authorities to stop violating fundamental democratic rights by criminalizing freedom of expression and political action and the free movement of ideas?
