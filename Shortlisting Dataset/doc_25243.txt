WRITTEN QUESTION E-5117/09 by Michael Cashman (S-D) , Glenis Willmott (S-D) and Richard Howitt (S-D) to the Commission (21 October 2009) Subject: Property fraud in Bulgaria Several of our UK constituents are amongst approximately four hundred people who have purchased property in Bulgaria through Ambasun UK. Ambasun UK developed the properties in partnership with Ambasun Bulgaria and an unspecified number of other partners, all of whom evidently have links to Bulgarian businesswoman Desi Antasova. The precise nature of the relationship between Ambasun UK and these Bulgarian-based companies is unclear. However it is apparent that there has been a breakdown in the partnership, with serious repercussions for the many hundreds of people who have bought the properties. Ambasun UK has put itself into administration without notice to purchasers — and liquidators have been appointed. Now the Bulgarian arm of the partnership is alleging fraud and misappropriation of clients’ funds with the UK arm doing likewise. All this means that our constituents have been left in a situation of intolerable uncertainty. In most cases these people have paid in full for their houses and apartments and are ready to move in but have been unable to obtain the deeds. They do not know where their money has gone, whether they can get their deeds or whether they can reclaim their money. Can the Commission confirm that there is a breach of EU legislation in this case? Will the Commission put pressure on the Bulgarian authorities to investigate unscrupulous property developers such as Ambasun?
