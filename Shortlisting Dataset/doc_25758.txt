WRITTEN QUESTION P-2405/08 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (23 April 2008) Subject: Distribution of government advertising among the printed media Under Article 7 of Presidential Decree 261/97 on the distribution of government advertising among the printed media, account must be taken of (a) the cost of inserting the advertisement, (b) the impact of the advertising medium on the public at large, and (c) the impact of the medium on specific categories of the public. Article 2, however, exempts public enterprises in which the government does not hold a majority of the shares but, nevertheless, exercises control and appoints their administrations. Data from the National Radio and Television Council reveal that the distribution of this huge amount of advertising expenditure is in breach of all the criteria applying to returns on investment in advertising and is, scandalously, biased towards certain publishing companies at the expense of others. What measures will the Commission take to put an end to this unacceptable situation and to put in place a legal framework to regulate the advertising expenditure of government enterprises controlled by the State in order to ensure respect for the principles of democracy, equality before the law, support for the regional press and consistency with the principles of competition which are being flagrantly contravened?
