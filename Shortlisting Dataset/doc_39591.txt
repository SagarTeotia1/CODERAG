is appropriate, in order to further reduce the adverse impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment caused by such equipment, to provide for systems for regular technical inspection of pesticide application equipment already in use. (11) Aerial spraying of pesticides has the potential to cause significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment, in particular from spray drift. Therefore, aerial spraying shall be generally banned with derogation possible where ▐there are no viable alternatives , the best available technology to reduce drift is used (e.g. low-drift nozzles) and the health of residents or bystanders is not affected . (12) The aquatic environment is especially sensitive to pesticides. It is therefore necessary that particular attention is paid to avoiding pollution of surface water and groundwater by taking appropriate measures such as, for example, the establishment of buffer strips or planting hedges along surface waters to reduce exposure of water bodies to spray drift. The dimensions of buffer zones should depend in particular on soil characteristics, geological and topographical features, climate, size of the watercourse, as well as agricultural characteristics of areas concerned. Use of pesticides in areas for the abstraction of drinking water, on or along transport routes, such as railway lines, on sealed or very permeable surfaces can lead to higher risks of pollution of the aquatic environment. In such areas, pesticide use should, therefore, be reduced as far as possible, or eliminated, if appropriate. (13) Use of pesticides can be particularly dangerous in very sensitive areas, such as Natura 2000 sites protected in accordance with Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 103, 25.4.1979, p. 1. Directive as last amended by Directive 2006/105/EC (OJ L 363, 20.12.2006, , p. 368 ). , and Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7. Directive as last amended by Directive 2006/105/EC . . The protection measures needed to attain the nature conservation objectives should be taken in accordance with those Directives. In other places such as residential areas, public parks, sports and recreation grounds, school grounds, children's playgrounds and in the vicinity of public healthcare facilities (clinics, hospitals, rehabilitation centres, health resorts, hospices) , the risks from exposure to pesticides of the general public are high. Use of pesticides in those areas should, therefore, be reduced as far as possible, or eliminated, where appropriate. (14) Handling of pesticides, including diluting and mixing the chemicals and cleaning of application equipment after use, and discharge of tank surplus, empty packaging and unused pesticides are particularly prone to unwanted exposure of humans and the environment. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for specific measures addressing those activities as a complement to the measures provided for under Articles 4 and 8 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste OJ L 114, 27.4.2006, p. 9. , and Articles 2 and 5 of Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous
