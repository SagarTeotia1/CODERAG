Question for written answer E-003935/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (20 April 2011) Subject: Fuel and ‘white outlets’ Fuel prices have a significant and direct impact on the cost of living and the competitiveness of production systems. In Italy, the growing number of ‘white outlets’ ( pompe bianche ), i.e. independent brandless distributors, would seem to offer customers attractive savings. 1. Is this a uniquely Italian phenomenon, or are there examples of the same trend in other Member States? 2. Has the Commission thought of ad hoc measures to promote the spread of ‘white outlets’?
