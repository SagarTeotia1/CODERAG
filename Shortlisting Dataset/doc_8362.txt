Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (12 November 2010) Regarding the potential of new technologies to help the mobility of vulnerable people the Commission indeed supports several research initiatives, both for indoor or outdoor solutions. A showcase was demonstrated at the December 2008 ministerial conference on e-Inclusion in Vienna ec.europa.eu/information_society/events/e-inclusion/2008/exhibition/navigation/ . Some of these projects are more oriented towards ‘macro-navigation’ (or routing) while a few also include the more difficult task of ‘micro-navigation’ (obstacle avoidance) which is essential for more severely vision-impaired users. The ENABLED research project investigated how sounds and vibrations can be brought into a navigation experience, and the HaptiMap research project www.haptimap.org continues this effort. The ASK-IT project investigated how people can organise their trips according to their accessibility needs, the accessibility characteristics of the places and of the different possible transportation means or paths: the resulting web-services semantic is now being further refined within the OASIS project www.oasis-project.eu . For micro-navigation, the SmartLine project provided geo-information along radio frequency identification (RFID)-equipped tactile lines, while the Sesamonet project ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/index.cfm?id=4210 from the Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra investigated an alternative electronic white-cane exploiting virtual tactile lines made of RFID-tags buried in the path: now used in the deployment case mentioned in the Honourable Member's question. A new call for research proposals includes the topic of supporting designers of accessible mainstream environments in order to provide a seamless accessibility experience to users moving between contexts. Furthermore the Commission is also fostering the leverage of public procurement in the built environment, by promoting and facilitating the use of accessibility requirements. To that end, it has issued a standardisation mandate to the European Standardisation Organisations on accessibility requirements in the built environment to be used in public procurement.
