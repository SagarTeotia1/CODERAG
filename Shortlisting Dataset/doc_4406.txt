ORAL QUESTION H-0489/04 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by María Herranz García to the Commission Subject: Rural development reform The Commission proposal on the introduction of a single fund to finance rural development with a view to the next financial perspective clearly places the competitiveness axis at a disadvantage by comparison with the remaining objectives of the new regulation on the operation of the second pillar of the CAP. Restricting aid for improving performance, marketing and processing to small and micro-enterprises will not only considerably reduce European Union support for making farms more competitive but will also jeopardise their future capacity to cope with the opening up of markets. Cooperatives, which already play a key role in bringing together supply in sectors such as fruit and vegetables, are excluded from such aid in the Commission proposal. Can the Commission explain why it is specifically excluding medium-sized enterprises from these forms of support? Is there any reason other than saving money for the Community budget?
