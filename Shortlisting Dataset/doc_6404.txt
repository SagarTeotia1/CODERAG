WRITTEN QUESTION E-0341/10 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (16 February 2010) Subject: Distribution of government advertising in the Greek press In its answer to my previous question on this subject (E‑0455/09), the Commission said that it ‘has now received the reply by the Greek authorities on the alleged state aid granted by the Greek Organisation of Football Prognostics (OPAP) to selective newpapers. The Commission is now carrying out a preliminary assessment in order to examine whether OPAP's advertisement spending policy involves any state aid towards selected newspapers.’ In view of the above, will the Commission say: Will it forward to me the non-confidential reply from the Greek government? Has it completed its inquiries and, if so, what are its conclusions?
