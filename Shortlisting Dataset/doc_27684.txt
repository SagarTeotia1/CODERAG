Answer given by Mr Patten on behalf of the Commission (22 September 2003) The Commission is aware of the three specific cases referred to by the Honourable Member concerning freedom of expression in Tunisia. All three cases bear some link to the problems of access to the Internet. However, when establishing a link between these problems and the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), one should bear in mind several elements. First, holding the second session of the WSIS summit in Tunisia was a decision taken by the United Nations' General Assembly and, therefore, has involved the Commission only indirectly. Second, the fact that the summit will be held along the Johannesburg model implies a range of positive side effects likely to benefit Tunisian civil society: a whole range of different actors will be involved in the preparation phase as well as in the summit itself. Third, the Commission, in its Communication COM(2003) 271 final. to the Council and the Parliament Towards a Global Partnership in the Information society: EU perspective in the context of the UN World Summit on the Information Society points out that the following principles need to be solemnly upheld and extended within the Information Society: The right of freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with the provisions of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The Commission will certainly use the opportunity of the WSIS to address problems related to human rights and democracy in Tunisia. First of all the upcoming Association Council on 30 September 2003 will pursue the continued dialogue held by the Union and Tunisia on this issue. Moreover, to further the freedom of expression the Commission is currently setting up a support and training programme for the Tunisian media (2.15 EUR).
