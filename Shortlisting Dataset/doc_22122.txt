WRITTEN QUESTION E-5180/09 by Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) to the Council (21 October 2009) Subject: Detention of 12 Sahrawis on political grounds Twelve Sahrawi activists were detained by Moroccan police last week. They included Ali Salem Tamek, Brahim Dahane and Mohamed Dadach, former political prisoners and important figures in the Sahrawi people's legitimate fight to have their rights respected and international legality enforced. According to public prosecutors in Casablanca, seven of them will be tried for ‘undermining the supreme interests of the Nation’. This is a clear example of political persecution as the detainees were returning from or intending to pay visits to Sahrawi refugee camps. The European Union should condemn the Moroccan government's repressive policy towards the Sahrawi people and actively intervene to bring it to an end. The European Union should also condemn the continuing human rights violations in the Western Sahara. Can the Council answer the following questions: Is it aware of this incident? If not, can the Council explain why it has not addressed this issue and how it plans to act in this regard? If yes, what steps does it intend to take to end Moroccan authorities' repression of the Sahrawi population and what response has it received? Bearing in mind the growing ties between the European Union and Morocco, does the Council intend to undertake any action to press the Moroccan Government to end the political persecution of the Sahrawi people and to release the people who have been detained arbitrarily for exercising their rights to free speech and assembly?
