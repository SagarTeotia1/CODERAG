WRITTEN QUESTION E-0048/07 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (19 January 2007) Subject: The situation in Nigeria Presidential elections will be held in Nigeria in April this year. In the run-up to this important event a number of worrying incidents have occurred in the country, in particular in the Niger delta area, which is very rich in hydrocarbons. More than 40 foreigners working in the petroleum industry were kidnapped between January and August 2006 and three Italian technicians are still being held hostage by their kidnappers, who claim to be MEND (Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta) militants. Nigerian politicians belonging to the opposition, who are candidates, at various levels, in the forthcoming elections, have also disappeared. The area in which the kidnaps have taken place is inhabited predominantly by the Igbo ethnic group, who were the victims of tragic massacres during the Biafran war and now are unable to enjoy the advantages deriving from the oil revenue, although the oil comes from the region where they live. 1. Is the Commission already aware of this situation? Has it contacted the Nigerian government as regards protecting Union citizens who fall into the hands of kidnappers? What kind of collaboration, if any, has it initiated with the Italian government and the oil companies that employed the kidnap victims? 2. In view of the elections in spring and bearing in mind the disappearance of political opposition leaders, what steps will the Commission take to ensure that the elections are held in a regular manner? 3. Are guarantees of the safety and security of European technicians working in the delta area and others being taken into account in the negotiations on Union aid to Nigeria, as well as respect for human rights and the human dignity of the various ethnic groups? 4. Does not the Commission consider it appropriate that Union observers should be present during the elections?
