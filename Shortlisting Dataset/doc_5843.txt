Question for written answer E-011128/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (13 January 2011) Subject: Facilitation of illegal immigration by Turkey According to recent updates on the Frontex's website, the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border between Turkey and Greece and entering Greek territory is huge. Specifically, it is estimated that 45000 illegal immigrants crossed the border, during the first half of 2010. Following a request by the Greek Government for help from the European Union, Frontex sent a team to guard the Greek border (RABIT 2010); this team confirmed that problem existed. The Frontex website posted information on 30 November 2010 stating that in, November, there had been a decrease of approximately 43.7 % in illegal immigrants. However, it found that there was still a problem of illegal immigration from Turkey to Greece, stressing that over 33000 illegal immigrants had crossed the border since 2 June, and this decline might be due to poor weather or other factors. Given the fact that Turkey is a candidate for accession to the European Union and for this reason receives and grants, even though Europe is grappling with an unprecedented economic crisis, will the Commission say: — Is it aware of the large number of illegal immigrants crossing from Turkey to Greece and thus to the rest of Europe? — What steps will it take to freeze the allocation of EU funds to a country that fails to respect the principles of the European Union and facilitates the entry of illegal immigrants into the EU?
