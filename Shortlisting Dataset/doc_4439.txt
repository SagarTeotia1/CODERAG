which are currently covered by the ECSC Treaty but are not included in the Coal and Steel Research Fund. Based on this assessment, the budgetary authority shall decide which activities shall be incorporated in the general budget. The current Financial Perspective shall be adjusted by the relevant amount, with no restriction being placed on the other currently funded programmes. Justification If the amounts allocated to this research fund are included in the Financial Perspective, the latter must be adjusted by an equivalent amount. If not, the fund would be financed under the current Community policies and not by a new ECSC contribution.
