WRITTEN QUESTION E-2648/05 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE-DE) to the Commission (18 July 2005) Subject: State of proceedings against Luxembourg's obstruction of Directive 98/5/EC The interpretation of the Luxembourg authorities concerning the transposition of Directive 98/5/EC OJ L 77, 14.3.1998, p. 36 . has been contested by the Commission. It appears, if the information concerned is correct, that on 14 December 2004 the Commission asked the European Court of Justice to resolve the dispute over the Luxembourg authorities' attitude. Can the Commission provide information on the present state of the proceedings now before the Court of Justice?
