for occupational health and safety, as many workers along the production chain are exposed to these materials without knowing whether the safety procedures implemented and the protection measures taken are adequate and efficient; notes that the number and diversity of workers exposed to the effects of nanomaterials is expected to increase in the future; calls, therefore, for sufficient time and budgetary resources to be made available for the technology to be assessed; 4. Recognises that current knowledge of the toxicity of nanoparticles is limited and that comprehensive information about what risks different nanoparticles may pose on workers is not available yet, but notes that preliminary results in most published studies indicate that the toxicity of insoluble particles of similar composition increases with decreasing particle diameter and increasing particle surface area; furthermore, notes that those studies reveal a risk of serious health effects arising from ultrafine particles, air pollution and fibres; 5. Emphasises the utmost importance of the safe and responsible use of nanomaterials in the short, medium and long term, as well as of the development of responsible nanotechnology which integrates health and safety considerations with production and application approaches; considers it therefore necessary to formulate adequate thresholds which are scientifically justifiable; 6. Recognises that prevention is of central importance in order to mitigate the risks and to eliminate potentially negative influences; emphasises that, as the scientific base needs to be improved, the precautionary principle has to be the guiding principle, along with the principle of the elimination of risk at source, in order to maintain a high level of protection of health and safety at work as well as of the environment; 7. Draws attention to the fact that different categories of people might be at risk at different stages of the product lifecycle: in the production and handling stages, in packaging, transport and maintenance, during disposal and demolition, and where secondary and end-users, and consumers are concerned; recalls that risk assessment has to be based on normal use and accidents, as well as the fact that the features are inhalation, dermal and other routes of exposure; stresses that the relevant legislation has to take into account the categories of people at risk as well as the risks related to these categories; 8. Underlines the importance of the Commission and Member States ensuring that the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC and its individual Directives, and in particular Directive 98/24/EC on hazardous chemical agents at work, are fully complied with; considers that the key elements of these Directives, with regard to nanomaterials, are the risk assessment, the protection and prevention measures, the information and consultation rights and the right to be trained; 9. Calls on the Commission and Member States to provide additional incentives to foster compliance with the regulatory framework, including for example strengthening labour inspection bodies and other enforcement and professional agencies, where appropriate; also calls on Member States to ensure adequate training for health and safety specialists necessary to prevent known as well as potentially harmful exposures to nanomaterials; 10. Draws attention to the need for prevention and risk reduction measures
