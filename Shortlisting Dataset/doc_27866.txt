Question for written answer E-6137/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) (27 July 2010) Subject: Combating child poverty Children are among the social groups that are most vulnerable to poverty. The spread of poverty and social exclusion as a result of the current deep economic and social crisis is therefore having a particularly severe impact on millions of children. According to the European network Eurochild, 20 % of children and young people in Europe are at risk of poverty. Bearing in mind that this is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, can the Commission say what measures are underway to combat child poverty, and what results they have achieved to date? More specifically, can the Commission provide the following information: 1. What targets have so far been set for reducing child poverty? 2. Is the Commission considering the possibility of setting up an annual assessment panel on child welfare in the EU? 3. What measures will it take to improve the collection of data on child poverty? 4. What measures have been taken to promote the exchange of experience and mutual learning among Member States in relation to policies and practices to combat child poverty? 5. How will it integrate child welfare into the various structural policies?
