serious failings in the measures applied at ports and airports with regard to import controls on food and animals, 1. Calls on the Member States to immediately tighten up their control measures at EU airports with respect to the import of food by tourists from non-EU countries, making, in particular, increased use of sniffer dogs; 2. Calls on the Member States to immediately launch an information campaign to highlight the risks of introducing FMD in imported foodstuffs which may carry the virus; 3. Proposes that any person entering the European Union from a country which has not been FMD-free for three months according to the International Animal Health Code of the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) should: ∙ be allowed to enter the European Union only after signing a document in which the dangers connected with FMD and the possibilities of transmitting the virus are described comprehensively and which should be available in the official languages of the European Union, ∙ confirm by means of their signature that he/she has understood the content of the document, ∙ confirm that he/she has had no contact with agricultural premises with dangerous contacts as regards FMD, ∙ confirm that he/she is not carrying any food which contains animal products, ∙ be subject to specific control and hygiene measures if there is sufficient reason to believe that he/she may pose a risk of transmission; 4. Calls on the Commission to draw up, together with the Member States, a detailed strategy aimed at reducing the risk of introduction of FMD by tourists and to submit either an adequate administrative proposal or a legislative proposal to Parliament and the Council as soon as possible; the strategy should include minimum standards for control measures at the borders of the European Union and at EU airports; the standards should not be weaker than the most stringent standards applied in comparable countries; 5. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
