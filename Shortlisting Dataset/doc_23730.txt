WRITTEN QUESTION E-4995/09 by Iva Zanicchi (PPE) to the Commission (14 October 2009) Subject: Effects of the global financial crisis and support for developing countries The recent financial crisis has triggered a global economic recession whose numerous repercussions have hit developing countries particularly hard, not least by exacerbating the food crisis: the toll of hunger victims has, for the first time in history, risen to 1020 million, and there are at present 100 million more people suffering from malnutrition than there were in 2008. The FAO (the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation) has sounded the alarm, noting that the scourge, which is also spreading to rich countries (where 15 million people are going hungry, the numbers having jumped by 15.4 % within the space of a year), is growing unremittingly at a disquieting rate. The financial crisis has had a very strong impact on the ACP (African, Caribbean, and Pacific) countries, bringing still more complications in terms of environmental challenges and volatile food prices. The Asia-Pacific region, the most populous part of the world, has the highest number of hungry people (642 million), following an increase of 10.5 % compared with 2008. Sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand, has the highest percentage of malnutrition victims, 32 % (approximately 265 million), 11.8 % more than in 2008; in the Caribbean countries too, the hungry have risen in number over the past year. Given that the developing countries, as well as being affected more severely by the global economic crisis, will have to deal with the greatest challenges as regards mitigating, and adapting to, climate change and that a substantial EU contribution will be essential to enable them to cope with these additional requirements, will the Commission take the lead in tackling the task ahead by coordinating donor responses and delivery of the necessary extra resources? Will it commit itself to other innovative solutions aimed at financing development in developing countries so as to cushion the effects of the crisis in the medium term?
