WRITTEN QUESTION E-1805/06 by Margrietus van den Berg (PSE) to the Commission (28 April 2006) Subject: Binding guidelines for testing of medicines abroad European manufacturers of medicines are increasingly conducting their research in eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. It is cheaper and quicker for them to do so. Such European companies as the British GlaxoSmithKline and the French Sanofi-Aventis contract their research out to Indian companies in particular. This enables international pharmaceutical companies to save up to 90 % on the cost of clinical trials. Poor and illiterate people are often used as guinea pigs in the trials. The principle of voluntary and informed consent to medical trials is being undermined. There are good international guidelines for the testing of new medicines, such as the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS code. However, these are not binding. The largest manufacturers of medicines have accepted these guidelines voluntarily, but there is no monitoring of compliance with them. Such monitoring is particularly lacking in cases where trials are contracted out. A compulsory code of conduct and good agreements on monitoring of compliance with it would enable us to clarify the situation and eliminate unethical practices in the testing of new medicines by European companies. Will the Commission make the existing guidelines binding for European companies, including in cases where they contract the work out?
