Supplementary answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (9 October 2008) In its reply of 25 February 2008 to parliamentary Written Question P‑0494/08 the Commission stated that it would ask the French authorities clarifications about their practice on the exemption from the visa handling fee of visa applicants under the age of 25, in order to assess its compatibility with the acquis and in particular with the table of Annex A2 of the Common Consular Instructions as amended by Council Decision 2006/440/EC of 1 June 2006 Council Decision 2006/440/EC of 1 June 2006 amending Annex A2 to the Common Consular Instructions and Annex A4a to the Common Manual on the fees to be charged corresponding to the administrative costs of processing visa applications, OJ L 175, 29.6.2006. . On 24 July 2008 the French authorities informed the Commission that, in conformity with the relevant Community acquis , their consulates have been instructed to end the practice of systematically exempting all applicants under the age of 25 from handling fee without prejudice to the flexibility provided to Member State's authorities by the Common Consular Instructions to waive this fee in individual cases. Indeed, the Member States are encouraged to make use of the flexibility provided by the Schengen acquis to waive or reduce the fee in individual cases in accordance with national law when this measure serves to promote cultural interests as well as interests in the field of foreign policy, development policy, other areas of vital public interest or for humanitarian reasons.
