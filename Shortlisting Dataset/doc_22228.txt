the governments and parliaments of the Member States. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The proposal for a Council regulation provides merely for certain technical amendments to Regulations Nos 6/2002 and 40/94 in order to take account of the proposed accession to the Geneva Act. Since none of them appear controversial, your rapporteur advocates approving the proposal without amendment, provided that proposal to accede to the Geneva Act is approved.
