Question for written answer E-9048/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Robert Goebbels (S&D) (3 November 2010) Subject: Independent experts In its proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council on Short Selling and certain aspects of Credit Default Swaps (COM(2010)0482) the Commission stated that it had asked the ‘independent’ European Securities Markets Expert Group (ESME) for advice on this subject. However, this ‘independent group’ consisted only of representatives of banks, investment funds and other financial institutions, including the stock market. It did not include a single academic, minority shareholder or expert not associated with the financial sector. 1. Why did the Commission limit its consultation to people whose employers have all been involved in short selling and clearly have no reason to root out dubious practices that are profitable for the financial sector? 2. Does the Commission not wish to learn from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, or the near-collapse of Northern Rock, victims of short selling and in particular of naked short selling?
