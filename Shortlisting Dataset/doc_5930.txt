Question for written answer E-7395/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Marian Harkin (ALDE) (17 September 2010) Subject: Eligibility of Irish language for eLearning Awards I wish to ask the Commission why Irish, as a working language of the EU, is not among the 25 languages eligible for use in the eLearning Awards for Europe programme which has just been launched. There are 25 languages eligible for the programme, 22 of which are official languages of the EU, meaning that three of the eligible languages are not official EU languages. Although this is reasonable in view of the countries eligible for the awards, Irish is an EU working language and can be spoken in plenary, and should therefore be one of the languages eligible for use in these awards. I have received queries from educational establishments which wish to enter for these awards using the Irish language, and I wish to ask whether the rules on eligible languages could be changed at this late stage so as to include Irish.
