budget of both FP7 (EUR 50.5 billion) and CIP (EUR 3.6 billion); points to the effectiveness and the possibility of determining quantified targets in terms of the amounts allocated to research and development spending; 2. Welcomes the fact that new financing methods exist and underlines the potential of the JEREMIE initiative and the Risk Sharing Finance Facility of the Commission and the European Investment Bank Group in boosting financing opportunities for innovative enterprises; recommends that regional actors exploit these new opportunities complementarily to Structural Funds financing; stresses in this context the need to effectively coordinate public and private investments; 3. Awaits the Commission’s Strategic Report as referred to in Article 30(2) of the General Regulation; considers that the Report will give a comprehensive overview of the performance of Member States in delivering the objectives for the period 2007 - 2009 and will be a basis for discussion on the future prospects of cohesion policy; 4. Reiterates the need for an integrated multi-level governance approach to specific policies in the EU; stresses that a functional multi-level governance system is a precondition for setting and implementing earmarking objectives efficiently; notes that the responsibility for the implementation of Structural Funds lies with national and regional authorities, while CIP and FP7 are centrally managed by the Commission; is aware of the administrative diversity existing at Member State level and believes it is important to identify the decision-making level which is most effective for citizens; 5. Considers it important to coordinate Community policies that play a role in achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion; believes it is necessary to undertake a closer analysis of their impact on the territory and on cohesion with a view to foster effective synergies and to identify and promote the most suitable means at European level of supporting local and regional investment in innovation; recalls the need to take account of the different social and economic circumstances of the three types of regions (convergence, transition and competitiveness), and the variations in creative and innovative capacity and entrepreneurial spirit; stresses in this context that investment in R&D, as also in innovation, education and resource-efficient technologies, will benefit traditional sectors and rural areas as much as it will high-skill service economies, and will therefore reinforce economic, social and territorial cohesion; 6. Highlights the great potential of cities in pursuing research and innovation; believes that smarter urban policy, based on technological advancements and addressing the fact that 80% of Europe’s population lives in towns, which is also where the greatest social disparities are, would contribute to sustainable economic growth; therefore calls for incorporating the urban dimension in future cohesion policy; Synergies between Structural Funds, FP7 and CIP 7. Acknowledges that, through the earmarking provisions for 2007-2013, cohesion policy is better geared to create synergies with research and innovation policies, and that at the same time the territorial dimension has become increasingly important in FP7 and CIP; calls for consideration to be given to a performance based earmarking mechanism with a stronger thematic focus allowing for appropriate policy responses to the new challenges; 8.
