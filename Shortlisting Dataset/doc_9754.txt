Supplementary answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (15 October 2008) Article 45(2) (d) of Directive 2004/18/EC Directive 2004/18/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, OJ L 134, 30.4.2004. provides for the possibility for Member States to include in their legal system provisions constituting a ground for exclusion of candidates ‘guilty of grave professional misconduct proven by any means which the contracting authorities can demonstrate’. However, Article 45(2) does not contain a definition of ‘has been guilty of grave professional misconduct’. It is therefore for national rules to specify the content and scope of the obligations at issue and the conditions for their fulfilment Therefore, a contracting authority may exclude a candidate on the basis of the facts referred to in Article 45(2) if national law provides for such a cause of exclusion, under conditions specified therein. However, as regards corruption, the Commission would draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the following: Article 45(1)b) provides that any candidate or tenderer who has been the subject of a conviction by final judgment of which the contracting authority is aware, for corruption as defined in Article 3 of the Council Act of 26 May 1997 OJ C 195, 25.6.1997. and Article 3(1) of Council Joint Action 98/742/JHA OJ L 358, 31.12.1998. — which has been replaced by Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA of 22 July 2003 OJ L 192, 31.7.2003. — respectively shall be excluded from participation in a public contract. Those instruments provide that each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that natural persons that are held liable for active corruption within the meaning of these instruments, are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions, including, at least in serious cases, penalties involving deprivation of liberty. Likewise, the same instruments provide that each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that legal persons can be held liable for active corruption committed for their benefit by certain natural persons, acting either individually or as part of an organ of the legal person. Therefore, in the EU, acts of corruption committed by individuals, whether or not committed for the benefit of legal persons, have been clearly recognised as criminal offences in nature. As a consequence, the Commission is of the view that, a Member State which would decide to provide in its legal order for the possibility for contracting authorities to exclude a natural or legal person accused of corruption from public procurement procedures for ‘grave professional misconduct’, should pay particular attention to the following points: defining by law the conditions under which such an exclusion may occur, as required by Article 45(2) subparagraph 2 of Directive 2004/18/EC; providing for effective remedies as required by Directives 89/665/EEC OJ L 395, 30.12.1989. and 92/13/EEC OJ L 76, 23.3.1992. as last modified by Directive 2007/66/EC OJ L 335, 20.12.2007. , and ; providing for procedural guarantees that are consistent with the fundamental rights
