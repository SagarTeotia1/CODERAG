WRITTEN QUESTION E-6396/07 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) and Emmanouil Angelakas (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (20 December 2007) Subject: Marketing of pharmaceuticals over the Internet In recent years, the Internet has been inundated with advertisements offering pharmaceuticals for sale to consumers for the treatment of various ailments at extremely low prices. The producer of these pharmaceuticals is unknown and clearly does not meet the standards laid down by good manufacturing practices. The production plants operate illegally. The pharmaceutical raw materials used are of dubious quality and the products have a reduced active ingredient content, thereby posing serious risks to users' health. These products are taken without a medical prescription, the sole criterion being their low cost. Moreover, the persistence of this phenomenon is damaging the European pharmaceuticals industry, which operates in accordance with the relevant EU regulations and directives. At the same time, tax is lost from legal sales by companies in the Member States. Furthermore, these products constitute a serious infringement of international rules on intellectual property, patents, and the falsification and counterfeiting of approved and certified pharmaceuticals. Will the Commission, therefore, say: 1. whether it possesses any statistical data concerning the volume of counterfeit pharmaceuticals marketed within the EU over the Internet, 2. what measures it will take to inform the public of the risks to which they expose their health when they purchase cheap medicines of dubious quality over the Internet, 3. what measures it will take to trace and close down illegal factories producing such dangerous substances, and 4. whether it will bring a case before the appellate bodies of international organisations competent in matters relating to protection of intellectual property and patent rights (World Trade Organisation, World Intellectual Property Organisation)?
