Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (24 March 2011) The Commission launched the flagship initiative ‘A resource-efficient Europe’ as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy on 26 January 2011 to deliver sustainable growth. It will help make resource efficiency the common denominator for a series of interrelated, long and medium-term policy proposals in the areas of climate change, energy, transport, industry, raw materials, agriculture, fisheries, biodiversity and regional development. Some actions will require considerable investment in technological improvements. Businesses need certainty to invest now. The Commission intends to present this year four interrelated components of the necessary long-term policy framework to ensure the necessary predictability. In March 2011, it outlined what the EU needs to do to create a low-carbon economy by 2050, cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 %, as part of global efforts to fight climate change. It also presented a vision for a low-carbon, resource-efficient, secure and competitive transport system by 2050. In the summer, it will define medium and long-term objectives and the means for achieving them, with the main aim of decoupling economic growth from resource use. This will be followed in the autumn by an analysis of how the EU can create an energy system by 2050 which is low-carbon, resource-efficient, secure and competitive. The question of targets, amongst other things, is currently under consideration as part of the ongoing public consultation on the long-term component foreseen for adoption in the summer 2011 (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/roadmap_re_en.htm). It is, therefore, too early at this stage to reach any conclusions on potential targets or their possible design or nature.
