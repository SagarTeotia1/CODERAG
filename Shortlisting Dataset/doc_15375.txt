Question for written answer E-003715/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Petru Constantin Luhan (PPE) (14 April 2011) Subject: Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Joint Programme was set up in 2008 by 20 EU Member States and three Associated countries. The first interim evaluation of the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme (COM(2010)763 final) concluded that the level of national financial contributions has been a major determining factor in the success of the programme. It also stated that participants have had to deal with the complexities arising from the diversity of national rules, as well as with differing payment schedules, sometimes affecting the running of the projects. Has an assessment been conducted on the fulfilment by participating states of their financial commitments? How will the Commission ensure that those commitments are honoured so that the projects, and hence their final beneficiaries, are not affected?
