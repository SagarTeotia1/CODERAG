1980s, from 8.5x in 1984 to 3.8x in the 1988 returns. In the absence of the correspondence files, it is not possible to say exactly what doubts may have existed over the returns, or how the downwards trend in cover for RMM was regarded, but it would not appear to have been an issue of any great concern to regulators." (Ch.16-3). "There are no DTI correspondence files dealing with Equitable for the period prior to 1991. A group of earlier files was destroyed ... in 1998 while the regulatory return files were still available (1987 and 1988 missing) back to 1981." (Ch.15-46,47,53). 22. Article 10 of the 3LD not respected: under-resourcing and non-respect of PRE Mr. LAKE in H1 claims that the " insurance regulators were seriously under-resourced throughout the 1990s ", contravening Article 23(3) of the 1LD as amended by the 3LD (Article 10). He then goes onto argue that Article 23(3)(b) of the 1LD as amended by the 3LD (Article 10) requires that the powers and means be sufficient to allow the competent authorities to be able to prevent or remedy any irregularities prejudicial to the interests of the policyholders, which was not done in this case. The Baird Report (WE 17) also gives support to the idea that insurance regulators were under-resourced during the crucial years when the ELAS crisis developed . It refers to the breakdown of staff involved in the insurance regulation on 1 January 1999: “...the total number of staff involved in the prudential regulation of approximately 200 insurance companies (…) was less than 135. By way of comparison, there were approximately 135 staff involved in the regulation of 400 authorised UK banks, building societies and UK branches of non-EU institutions” (paragraph 2.23.5). Mr. HOLMES (WE 84) also gives credence to the Baird report when criticizing the lack of means available to regulators during the 1990’s. In addition, he states that “ even allowing for the discretion which Member States possess in deciding upon an appropriate level of regulatory resources, it must be open to doubt whether the UK provided its competent authorities with the means necessary for supervision, the standard explicitly laid down in the Community legislation since November 1992. On the one hand, it must be asked whether in numerical terms sufficient staff were devoted to the task. On the other hand, it must also be asked whether the personnel that were available were appropriately qualified to provide supervision which was effective.” Mr. LAKE, also in H1, argues that Articles 23(1), 23(2) and 23(3) of the 1LD as amended by the 3LD (Article 10) require annual accounts and the periodical returns, together with statistical documents, necessary for the purposes of supervision, which must enable the competent authorities to take any measures that are appropriate and necessary to ensure that the undertaking's business continues to comply with the laws in each Member State, including the home Member State. Mr. LAKE also claims that the UK simply did not implement the legal requirements to enable the authorities to monitor the application of its own law in
