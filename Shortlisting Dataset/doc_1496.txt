Question for written answer E-002140/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President/High Representative) Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (23 February 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Rossella Urru Rossella Urru was kidnapped by a terrorist group during the night of 22-23 October 2011. The 29‑year-old Italian aid worker was, out of compassion and a desire to help, overseeing food supplies at the Saharawi refugee camp in Rabuni. She has now been in the hands of an armed group from south-east Algeria for the past four months. The last news heard about Rossella was in December 2011, when a dissident AQMI (al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) group (Jamat Tawhid Wal Jihad Fi Garbi Afriqqiya) claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. No further news has been received since. — Is the Vice-President/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy aware of this situation? — What action will she take to ensure the EU is involved in the investigation, given the new powers conferred by the Treaty of Lisbon?
