Reply (20 September 2010) As the honourable MEP is aware, in accordance with Art. 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, ‘environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Union policies and activities, in particular with a view to promoting sustainable development’. Furthermore, Directive 2002/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 March 2002 on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at Community airports OJ L 85, 28.3.2002, p. 40 . and Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment OJ L 197, 21.7.2001, p. 30 . set up a uniform level of protection of the environment and of the population living in close proximity to airport sites, which Member States have to respect when taking decisions on the construction or the functioning of airports. It is for the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, to oversee Member States' application of these rules. Provided that Member States respect the above rules, the specific location of airports is an issue pertaining to their competence and the Council is not therefore in a position to comment on this.
