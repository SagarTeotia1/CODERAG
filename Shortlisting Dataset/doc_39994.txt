WRITTEN QUESTION E-6588/07 by Jonathan Evans (PPE-DE) and Charles Tannock (PPE‑DE) to the Council (15 January 2008) Subject: Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS travelling to the United States It has been reported in the media that new proposals from the US Department of Homeland Security may make it more difficult for people with HIV/AIDS to travel to the United States. The proposals, if introduced, would limit the stay of people with HIV/AIDS to 30 days at any one time (as opposed to 90 days under the Visa Waiver Programme for people who are HIV-negative). The proposals will also deny them the right of appeal against refusal of visa/entry and will deny them any opportunity to adjust their status while in the US. To what extent does the Council believe that US restrictions on HIV-positive people entering the US amount to discrimination, directly or indirectly? To what extent does the Council believe that the new proposals infringe the human rights of people already suffering from the dreadful consequences of living with HIV/AIDS? What measures will the Council take to raise this issue with the US authorities?
