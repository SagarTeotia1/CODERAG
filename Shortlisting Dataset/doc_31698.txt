Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (21 September 2005) Council Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 . on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (EIA Directive) as amended by Directive 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 . and Directive 2003/35/EC OJ L 156, 25.6.2003 . provides that Member States must ensure that, before development consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an assessment of their environmental effects. As part of the assessment procedure outlined by the EIA Directive, developers must submit certain information to the competent authorities in Member States, including a description of the likely effects of the project and other contents listed in Article 5 and Annex IV of the directive. This information is sometimes referred to as ‘environmental study’ or ‘environmental statement’. Projects covered by the EIA Directive are listed in Annex I and II of the directive. For Annex I projects an EIA is mandatory, whereas for Annex II projects Member States have to determine (in a procedure called ‘screening’) if they are likely to have significant effects on the environment. If they are, an EIA must be carried out. Waste-water treatment plants fall within Annex I(13) if their capacity is above 150000 population equivalents (p.e.), or else they fall within Annex II(11)(c). Sludge de‑watering plants, provided they can be considered as waste disposal installations, fall either within Annex I(10) where the capacity of the installation exceeds 100 tonnes per day, or in Annex II(11)(b). Whether specific plants require an EIA will depend on their size and on their likely significant effects on the environment. Apart from the impact on water quality (which is comprehensively regulated by the Urban Waste-Water Treatment Directive 91/271/EEC Council Directive 91/271/EEC of 21 May 1991 concerning urban waste-water treatment, OJ L 135, 30.5.1991. and the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC) Directive 2000/60/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000. , possible impacts of waste-water treatment plants include odour (with sludge handling being one of the key sources of possible odour), and noise. The Urban Waste-Water Treatment Directive 91/271/EEC provides for the treatment of waste-water in all settlements above 2000 inhabitants (or the equivalent in waste-water) and establishes effluent quality standards for the treated waste-water to be discharged into the aquatic environment. Moreover, under Directive 85/337/EEC as amended, when an EIA is carried out it must contain a description of the likely significant environmental effects of the proposed project, including the emission of pollutants and the creation of nuisances. Where significant adverse effects are identified, measures to avoid, reduce, and, if possible, remedy them must be proposed in the ‘environmental statement’. There is no specific legislation in the acquis concerning odours originating from sewage sludge treatment. However, according to Article 4 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC OJ L 194, 25.7.1975 , as amended by Council Directive 91/156/EEC of 18 March 1991 ( OJ L 78, 26.3.1991
