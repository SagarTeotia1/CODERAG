Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (31 May 2010) The Commission sent a letter to all Member States on 10 August 2009 requesting information on the implementation of Regulation 1371/2007 OJ L 315, 3.12.2007. . The Commission has not yet received a reply to the abovementioned letter from Ireland. Therefore, it might be presumed that Ireland is not seeking any derogation to the provisions of the regulation. It also has to be noted that, currently, only four Member States have officially notified their exemptions (Greece, Finland, Hungary and Romania). Consequently, the Commission will soon send a second letter to the Member States reminding them of their duties under Article 2.7 of the regulation, providing that ‘Member States shall inform the Commission of exemptions granted’.
