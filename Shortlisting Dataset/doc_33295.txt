WRITTEN QUESTION E-1640/07 by Ashley Mote (ITS) to the Commission (29 March 2007) Subject: Cross-border carousel fraud Has OLAF yet clarified the current level of cross-border ‘carousel’ fraud? If so, what is it? How many ‘missing’ traders have been investigated? How many legitimate traders have been investigated? What is the current estimated annual value of these frauds across all 27 Member States? What is the estimated loss of VAT receipts across all 27 Member States? How is OLAF coordinating effective cross-border action at the European level against this now well-established fraud? Which countries are currently active? Which are at least having discussions with OLAF? Which electronics or other industry sectors, apart from mobile phones, are being used as vehicles for this fraud? Does the Commission agree that the problem of cross-border carousel VAT fraud is getting worse? If so, is that because insufficient action is being taken to deal with it effectively?
