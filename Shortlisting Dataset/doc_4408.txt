WRITTEN QUESTION P-0108/06 by Anne Van Lancker (PSE) to the Commission (18 January 2006) Subject: Compatibility of prior declarations concerning the posting of workers with Community law In various Member States, service-providers who, with a view to providing services within the territory of the Member State concerned, intend to post workers there are required to submit a prior declaration to the appropriate departments in the Member State where the service is to be provided. In Belgium, a system is currently being prepared under which all cross-border employment must be registered in advance, which is to replace the existing requirement to submit a prior declaration of posting — a document containing information about the employer, the employee and the conditions of posting. Anyone who wishes to post workers to Belgium and employ them there will therefore have to have this registered in advance with the competent national authority. Are national rules which require a service-provider to submit a prior declaration of posting of workers or to comply with a prior registration requirement compatible with Community law, particularly the rules in the EC Treaty concerning freedom to provide services (Articles 49 and 50 of the EC Treaty) and associated case-law of the European Court of Justice, and if so, to what extent is this the case?
