Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (22 February 2012) The Honourable Member is invited to consult the Commission webpage http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm which provides an overview — on the basis of the information provided by Member States — on the safety equipment required by Member States. According to this information, roadside warning triangles are required in all Member States, except in Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom. The Commission understood that triangles are used to provide for an advance warning of broken-down vehicles which is not provided for with triangles that stick to vehicles as proposed by the Honourable Member. The Commission does not have plans to propose legislation making warning triangles mandatory at European level. Taking into account the subsidiarity principle, the Commission considers that this is best regulated at national level.
