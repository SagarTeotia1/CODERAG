WRITTEN QUESTION P-0916/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (3 March 2005) Subject: Psyttalia biological treatment plant The treatment of sewage sludge from Psyttalia biological treatment plant continues to pose very serious problems. The competent authorities have proposed various solutions (for example, a drying and aeration unit on the island of Psyttalia), without making clear whether they are temporary or permanent arrangements, whether the sewage sludge will be used or where the residues which will amount to 8% of the original quantities will be channelled, what will become of the heavy metals (177 tonnes of chromium, 13.3 tonnes of nickel, 60 tonnes of copper and 550 tonnes of zinc) derived from the sewage sludge or how much atmospheric pollution will be caused by the dioxins released from the combustion of the sludge in situ. Will the Commission give an exact account of the proposals put forward by the Greek authorities to tackle the problem and say whether there is a clear timetable for executing the necessary work, whether the relevant environmental impact assessments have been approved and whether a co-funding plan has been submitted, and if so, for what amount? In October 2002 the Commission initiated an infringement procedure on the basis of Article 226 of the EC Treaty concerning the treatment of sewage sludge at Psyttalia. Can it say what stage this infringement procedure has reached? Will it appeal to the European Court of Justice if Greece has not complied with the Commission's reasoned opinion by the deadline?
