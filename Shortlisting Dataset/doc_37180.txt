Answer given by Ms Fischer-Boel on behalf of the Commission (2 May 2006) The communication on simplification and better regulation for the common agricultural policy (CAP) COM(2005)509 final. states on page 9 that ‘The Commission is prepared in the context of the current initiative to test the feasibility of an “EU net administrative cost method” to discuss options for assisting national administrations to quantify and reduce administrative costs imposed on farmers by CAP mechanisms’. This point has been explicitly taken up by the conclusions the Council reached in December 2005 as a result of its discussions on the said communication. In No 9 of its conclusions, the Council invites ‘the Commission to explore, in cooperation with Member States, options for establishing measurable targets for the reduction of the administrative burden of EU regulation in the agriculture sector, and invites the Commission to explore how best to integrate the measurement of administrative burdens into its action plan, and on that basis present a roadmap to the Council’. Taking into account these commitments, the Commission is prepared to take concrete steps so that this area can be included in the simplification action plan. In this context, the Commission is planning to assess the administrative cost for farmers of certain CAP-related measures, on the basis of the Community method for assessing administrative costs (see communication from the Commission of 21 October 2005 on an EU methodology for assessing administrative costs imposed by legislation COM(2005)518 final. and the operational manual included in the Commission’s impact assessment guidelines http://www.europe.eu.int/comm/secretariat_general/impact/docs_en.htm ).
