Reconstruction, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, the European Training Foundation, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and the European Food Safety Authority, C. whereas on 12 April 2005 Parliament gave discharge to the Director in respect of the implementation of the Foundation's budget for the 2003 financial year OJ L 196, 27.7.2005, p. 113. and in its resolution containing the comments accompanying the discharge decision OJ L 196, 27.7.2005, p. 114. it inter alia noted that the Court of Auditors had again criticised the Foundation for a failure to properly present in its accounts expenditure related to the Tempus programme and expected to be fully informed in the Foundation's 2004 annual activity report about a solution, agreed with the Commission, regarding the correct presentation in the accounts of this expenditure, 1. Recalls that, under Article 185 of the Financial Regulation, Parliament shall give discharge for the implementation of the budgets of the bodies set up by the Communities and having legal personality which actually receive grants charged to the budget; points out, however, that not all of these bodies are fully, or even partially, funded via grants charged to the budget; emphasises that the discharge decision therefore covers both the budget and the non-budget funding of these bodies; considers it unacceptable that some of the bodies set up by the Union are accountable for the expenditure of income received from sources other than the budget whilst others, which do not receive a subsidy from the budget, are not; affirms the principle that all Community agencies, whether or not they are subsidised, are subject to discharge by Parliament, even when another discharge authority intervenes in accordance with their basic texts; takes the view that there is a need to review all texts that go against this principle; 2.
