WRITTEN QUESTION E-0125/08 by Alexander Alvaro (ALDE) and Marco Cappato (ALDE) to the Commission (22 January 2008) Subject: Transposition of Directive 2006/24/EC on data retention Directive 2006/24/EC OJ L 105, 13.4.2006, p. 54 . of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC stated that Member States had to transpose it no later than 15 September 2007. Member States also had a possibility to postpone the application of the directive to the retention of communications data relating to Internet access, Internet telephony and Internet e-mail until 15 March 2009, by notifying the Council and the Commission by way of a declaration. The Commission has already sent letters of formal notice in November to some Member States which did not transpose the directive in time. Can the Commission illustrate which Member States transposed the directive, which did not, which were sent a letter of formal notice, which replied, with which justifications for the delay, and when will it send out reasoned opinions and to which Member States? Could the Commission illustrate which Member States have used the exception related to the Internet?
