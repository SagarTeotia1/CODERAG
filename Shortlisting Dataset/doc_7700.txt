Question for written answer E-007414/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (27 July 2011) Subject: E.coli outbreak caused by bean sprouts The head of the German disease control centre has announced that locally grown bean sprouts were the cause of the E.coli outbreak which killed 30 people and affected nearly 3 000. The sprouts, from a farm in Lower Saxony, have undergone laboratory testing, and, although the results are not yet available, the epidemiological investigation has produced enough evidence to determine the source. Has the Commission formed its own opinion as to the source of the E.coli outbreak?
