WRITTEN QUESTION P-5295/07 by James Nicholson (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 October 2007) Subject: Healthcare in France for non-French EU citizens Newspapers in the United Kingdom have reported that under new rules expatriates in France are to lose their right to state healthcare once they have lived in the country for more than two years without working. This will impact badly on the thousands of British citizens who retire early to France. Will the Commission seek to establish whether there has been any breach of EC law in this matter and, if so, what action it intends to take to remedy the problem?
