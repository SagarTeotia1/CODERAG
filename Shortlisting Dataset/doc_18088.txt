Reply (15 September 2008) The EU does not have any competence now, nor will it have under the Lisbon Treaty if it comes into force, to deal with prison matters as referred to in this question. These are the responsibility of the Member States. However, the Honourable Member's attention is drawn to the fact that prison issues fall within the competence of the Council of Europe, which has adopted the so-called European Prison Rules and has a special Committee of Directors of Prison Administrations.
