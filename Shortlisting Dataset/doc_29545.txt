WRITTEN QUESTION E-1293/06 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (29 March 2006) Subject: Women's rights in Turkey On 6 March 2005, the Turkish police reacted brutally to a peaceful demonstration by women to mark International Women's Day. In its resolution last year regarding 8 March, the European Parliament strongly condemned this behaviour and asked the Commission to present Parliament with a full report on what happened. Furthermore, Parliament emphasised on 6 July 2005 that the rights of Turkish women should be central to the accession negotiations with Turkey and called on the Commission to press for steps to be taken to ensure that newborn children are registered immediately, in order to prevent forced marriages. 1. When will the Commission be able to present the full report requested on the events of 6 March 2005? 2. In what way has the Commission placed the brutal actions of the Turkish police on 6 March on the agenda for the accession negotiations and discussions with Turkish representatives? Is the Commission satisfied with the criminal investigations carried out by the Turkish authorities or does it consider that more action needs to be taken? 3. What has the Commission done so far to press for the immediate registration of newborn children in Turkey? Did Commissioner Špidla raise this issue during his visit to Turkey on 6 March 2006? 4. Is it already possible for Turkish women's organisations to participate in the EU's Daphne II programme to combat violence against women and are they taking advantage of this opportunity?
