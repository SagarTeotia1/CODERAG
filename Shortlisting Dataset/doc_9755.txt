Article 45(2) subparagraph 2 of Directive 2004/18/EC; providing for effective remedies as required by Directives 89/665/EEC OJ L 395, 30.12.1989. and 92/13/EEC OJ L 76, 23.3.1992. as last modified by Directive 2007/66/EC OJ L 335, 20.12.2007. , and ; providing for procedural guarantees that are consistent with the fundamental rights as recognised and interpreted by the European Court of Justice. Among these fundamental rights, the Commission would like to emphasise in this context the right of the defence which has notably been enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights See on http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/ and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights OJ C 364, 18.12.2000. . As the Court made it clear in Joint Cases C-226/04 and C-228/04, ‘La Cascina’, the effects of bringing administrative or legal proceedings are closely linked to the exercise and safeguard of fundamental rights in relation to judicial protection, respect for which is also guaranteed by the Community legal order. National legislation which paid no heed to the effects of bringing administrative or legal proceedings on the possibility to participate in a procedure for the award of a contract would risk infringing the fundamental rights of the parties concerned. Such an interpretation of Article 45(1)b) and (2)(d) of Directive 2004/18/EC, is consistent with the very objective of this directive taken as a whole (see Recital 2 of Directive 2004/18/EC) which is to ensure respect by contracting authorities of the fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty and of the principles deriving there from such as the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency, mutual recognition and proportionality, in the context of public procurement procedures.
