WRITTEN QUESTION E-2038/10 by Philip Claeys (NI) to the Commission (6 April 2010) Subject: Purpose of unpaid IPA funds — funding for Turkey in 2008 Under Regulation No 718/2007 OJ L 170, 29.6.2007, p. 1 . funds are allocated to candidate countries such as Turkey through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). Funding of EUR 538 million for 2008 was provided for in the multiannual plan (MIPD) and a national programme. According to a report submitted to Parliament (COM(2009)0699), no IPA programmes were carried out in Turkey in 2008 as the framework agreement was not ratified by the Parliament until December 2008. 1. Is it therefore right to conclude that the figure of EUR 538 million for Turkey in 2008 has been definitively lost? If so, how and where was this repaid sum re-included in the EU budget? 2. Can the Commission see any legal grounds for asserting that this figure intended for 2008 could still be paid to Turkey in later years? If so, which? 3. For which sections of the IPA has Turkey since then fulfilled the legally prescribed management conditions, and since what date? 4. What amounts in the IPA for Turkey for 2008 and 2009, if any, were placed in a reserve, who is managing that reserve, and who decides on any release of such funds? What specific decisions on their release have already been taken in the meantime, by whom and when?
