the light of Member State budgets; 6. Emphasises that China is the world leader in terms of installed wind farm capacity, that Chinese and Indian producers are among the top ten wind turbine producers, and that China and Taiwan currently manufacture most of the world’s photovoltaic panels; calls on the Commission and the Member States to take steps to promote the eco‑efficient development and production in the EU of these technologies and of new, innovative technologies needed to achieve ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; 7. Hopes that concrete and measurable targets will swiftly be established for each sector, in order to inspire confidence and cooperation among, and to encourage, private investors and a better use of European funds; stresses that renewable energy, innovation and the development and deployment of breakthrough technologies contribute to the fight against climate change and, at the same time, help convince the EU’s partners worldwide that emissions reductions are feasible without losing competitiveness or putting at risk job creation; considers it essential that Europe and its Member States lead by example in establishing a system for investment in new, energy-efficient and low carbon technologies; calls for the reinforcement of existing financing schemes in order to achieve the roadmap objectives, as well as for discussions to be promptly launched on the financial instruments that need to be deployed, and for the facilitation of better synergies between national and European financing schemes; believes that multisource financing schemes can be an effective tool; emphasises the important role of regional and cohesion policy funding as the main instrument for co-financing regional measures for the transition to a low carbon economy; considers that a significant proportion of financing for the 2014-2020 programming period should be allocated to meeting the objectives of the 2050 roadmap; 8. Draws attention to the fact that the EU and the Member States have not invested sufficiently in measures to reduce CO2 emissions or to increase energy efficiency in the fields of construction and transport; calls on the Commission and Member States to allocate increased funding to measures to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and of centralised urban heating and cooling networks, both in the review of the current Financial Perspective and under future Multiannual Financial Frameworks; 9. Considers that the achievement of these objectives by 2050, without prejudging Member States’ own energy mixes, could lead to a reduction in consumption, increased security and reliability of energy supply and the containment of energy price volatility, thus providing fair and competitive energy prices for consumers and businesses and improving the EU’s competitiveness and employment growth; 10. Recalls existing assessments which indicate that improving energy efficiency and reducing energy use by 20% compared to 2020 projections is not currently on track; calls for rapid action, greater ambition and stronger political commitment to achieve the 2020 targets and to look beyond 2020, thus bringing in appropriate investments; endorses the conclusion in the Commission’s roadmap that energy efficiency policies are key to further reducing carbon emissions; considers therefore that binding targets should not be excluded; stresses that energy
