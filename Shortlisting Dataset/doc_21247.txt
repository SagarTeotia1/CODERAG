in the development of standards and interoperable energy-related Internet technologies and energy-efficient ICT applications, in particular smart grids, the full and timely deployment of smart home systems such as smart meters designed to benefit the consumer, and modernising and developing an interconnected European electricity supergrid and LNG infrastructures; emphasises, with regard to interregional connections, the need to launch an investment plan based notably on the European Energy Infrastructure Package, so as to secure the diversification of energy supply sources; calls on the Commission to propose practical solutions for the efficient integration of large amounts of renewables by promoting market rules that allow for efficient and transparent international power exchange; calls, therefore, for the swift integration and uptake of crossborder electricity markets; recognises the urgent need for a long-term vision, given the many years required to build energy infrastructure with a long lifetime; welcomes the focus on energy infrastructure in the proposed Connecting Europe Facility; 77. Draws attention to the fact that the current 20 % target is based on the contribution made by nuclear power to the energy mix in number of Member States; notes that the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2011 includes a ‘lower-nuclear’ case according to which the projected increase in worldwide CO 2 emissions from the power sector would be substantially higher in the medium term due to an increased use of fossil fuels; reiterates that the decision by some Member States to shut down some existing nuclear reactors must not serve to justify reducing the level of ambition of their current climate policies; points out that, according to the IEA, achieving the 2°C goal would require faster development and deployment of CCS technologies in both coal- and gas-fired power plants; notes, however, that CCS technology is still at the testing and pre-commercial stage, so alternative scenarios also need to be considered, such as high renewables and energy efficiency scenarios; thus calls for increased support for the development and application of breakthrough technologies in order to increase energy efficiency and decouple economic growth from energy consumption; 78. Considers that the achievement of these objectives by 2050, without prejudging Member States’ own energy mixes, could lead to a reduction in consumption, increased security and reliability of energy supply and the containment of energy price volatility, thus providing fair and competitive energy prices for consumers and businesses and improving the EU’s competitiveness and employment growth; Industry 79. Insists that EU support for the ‘green economy’ should recognise the importance of investment by existing industries used to significantly improve the efficiency of resource use and reduce CO 2 emissions and to reach the EU 2020 Strategy targets on green jobs creation; underlines that a greener economy should support competitiveness and innovation in all sectors by focusing on areas where improvements are more economically efficient and more environmentally effective; 80. Calls on the Commission to explore innovative financial instruments for investment in a low-carbon economy; 81. Calls on the Member States and the Commission to support the creation of innovation clusters in order to develop regional and national solutions; Transport 82. Endorses the
