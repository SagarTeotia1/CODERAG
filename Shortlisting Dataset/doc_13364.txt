Question for written answer E-000874/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Teixeira (PPE) (9 February 2011) Subject: Increase in economic aid to Tunisia The partnership between the European Union and Tunisia, part of the European neighbourhood policy, is defined in the Association Agreement signed on 17 July 1995 with the aim of establishing political, economic and social cooperation. Under the terms of this Euro-Mediterranean Agreement, reciprocal respect for the importance of human rights, democracy and the rule of law is an essential condition for the partnership between the European Union and Tunisia. In the context of the EU's relations with Tunisia, the Member States also agreed a package of European economic aid for Tunisia with an estimated value of EUR 240 million for the period from 2011 to 2013. Consideration is currently being given to the possibility of increasing this EU aid in order to tackle challenges such as boosting employment, reforming the economy, making business more competitive and modernising the legal system, once the situation has stabilised following the collapse of the previous regime led by former President Ben Ali. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. What view does it take of a possible decision to increase the European Union's economic aid to Tunisia, bearing in mind the current financial and economic crisis in the European Union and the consequent implementation of strict austerity measures? 2. How does it view the prospect of agreeing an increase in the EU's economic aid to partner countries when an increase in the European Financial Stability Fund, which was created to provide an urgent solution to internal difficulties intrinsic to European integration, is proving to be a difficult and lengthy process that is openly contested by some Member States?
