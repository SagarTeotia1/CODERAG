Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (12 March 2012) As the Commission communication on the Youth Opportunities Initiative COM(2011) 933 of 20 December 2011. states, the Commission will provide the Member States with technical assistance for the use of EU funds to support apprenticeship schemes and entrepreneurship. Such technical assistance is managed directly by the Commission and the target countries will be identified depending on the most urgent needs. In the course of 2012 the Commission will also implement the preparatory action which Parliament has proposed on the ‘Youth Guarantee’, which is a policy concept to ensure that young people are either in a job, education or (re-)training within four months of leaving school. As part of this action support will be provided to a limited number of pilot measures in Member States to establish a ‘Youth Guarantee’ locally. In particular Member States and regions where unemployment among young people is very high, as is the case for Greece, will be encouraged to participate in the action.
