WRITTEN QUESTION E-1879/08 by Karl-Heinz Florenz (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (7 April 2008) Subject: Consultation of the parties concerned in the framework of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) The development of the framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) is promoting global health security. The dangers to health inherent in smoking should not be underplayed. An objective overview is only possible if there are continuous consultations with all parties concerned (NGOs, industry, public institutions, politicians, etc.). This is why I held intensive discussions with the relevant stakeholders when producing my report (the basis for the European Parliament’s resolution on the Green Paper ‘Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke’ of 24 October 2007). I consider the involvement of all sides to be vital in a democratic process. However, Article 5.3 of the framework Convention (FCTC) seems intended to limit the participation of certain groups: ‘In setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law.’ At the second meeting of the signatory states (Conference of the Parties) in July 2007, it was decided to set up a working party to draw up guidelines on Article 5.3. The working party is to present a progress report or draft guidelines by the time of the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties (provisional date: autumn 2008). — Does the Commission consider it necessary, as part of a democratic process, for all participants to be given the opportunity to express their views? — Can the Commission envisage the possible exclusion of any of the branches of industry concerned from further consultations on the framework Convention (FCTC) on the basis of Article 5.3 of the FCTC, in spite of a democratic participatory process which is necessary on principle?
