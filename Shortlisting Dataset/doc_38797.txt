Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (24 June 2011) Cedefop undertakes various European-level research activities on potential labour market imbalances due to changing skill demand and supply and on qualifications developments, assessment of skills and competences and validation of all types of learning, including non-formal and informal, which are also relevant for migrants. However, Cedefop has not carried out any specific research or analysis on the impact of the arrival of refugees from the various upheavals in North Africa. Clearly, we are still only at the beginning of this process, and future trends are difficult to predict. Nonetheless, Cedefop has been working in a number of areas that may provide useful insight into training needs in the medium and long term. In 2012 Cedefop will, according to the draft work programme that will be adopted by its Governing Board at the end of 2011: — analyse how national policies and strategies address the guidance needs of adult immigrants as well as how they support the labour market integration of migrant workers; — publish the results of four years of research on skills mismatches for vulnerable groups, i.e. ageing workers, migrants and ethnic minorities, as well as the unemployed and people experiencing labour market transitions. These results will also be disseminated in a conference bringing together researchers and policy-makers. In line with its Europe 2020 flagship initiative, an Agenda for New Skills and Jobs, the Commission will examine the emerging ‘bottleneck’ occupations and skills gaps which could be filled with well-targeted migration strategies. It will present a Green Paper on economic immigration and employment policy based on a detailed analysis of European labour markets needs as well as an evaluation of national integration policies of economic migrants, hence providing a meaningful contribution to the definition of short and medium term immigration policy.
