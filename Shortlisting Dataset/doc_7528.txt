work to ensure that their lack of experience on the job does not lead to work-related accidents; encourages Member States to exchange good practice in this regard and calls on temporary employment agencies to raise awareness among employers and the young workers themselves; 52. Highlights the role of the social partners in informing and training workers and employers on their rights and obligations in an employment relationship and on the enforcement of existing law in this area and therefore calls on the Commission to promote technical support for social partners and to encourage them to share (ex 434)knowledge and experience in order to improve working conditions; 53. Highlights the valuable role played by the social partners which already achieved some success in reforming labour markets, namely through the conclusion of agreements on parental leave, part time work and fixed-term contracts, as well as telework and lifelong learning; 54. Believes that the Member States must demonstrate a spirit of openness in the dialogue with the social partners on the subject of modernising labour law and adapting it to the challenges of the 21st century, take account of the social partners’ arguments and respond to their concerns; 55. Points to the positive role that collective bargaining at national, sectoral and company level can play in employment relationships and work organisation, increasing the productivity of firms and improving working conditions, thereby encouraging growth in employment and points to the possibility of changing arrangements so as to strengthen the role of collective bargainingand open up such bargaining for solutions close at company level which benefit employees and employers; 56. Calls on the Commission and the Member States under the programme to improve law-making to cooperate constantly with the social partners, and where appropriate other relevant, representative civil society bodies on any legislation in the labour law or social policy fields; with a view to simplifying administrative proceduresfacing small and medium-sized (ex 297)enterprises and new firms in particular, making their financial situation easier to increase their competitiveness in order to create jobs; 57. Calls on the Commission to regulate joint and several liability for general or principal undertakings, in order to deal with abuses in the subcontracting and outsourcing of workers and to set up a transparent and competitive market for all companies on the basis of a level playing field regarding respect for labour standards and working conditions, in particular calls on the Commission and the Member States to clearly establish at European level who is responsible for compliance with labour law and for paying the associated wages, social security contributions and taxes in a chain of subcontractors; 58. Expresses its deep conviction that creating insecure, poorly-paid jobs is not an appropriate response to the relocation trend affecting more and more sectors; considers, on the contrary, that it is investment in research, development, training and life-long learning which will be able to boost those sectors which are currently suffering from a lack of competitiveness; 59. Calls on the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a dispute settlement system, to enable the European agreements between social partners
