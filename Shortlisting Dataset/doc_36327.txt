WRITTEN QUESTION P-1779/04 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE-DE) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Treatment of Greek visitors to Poland Many Greek visitors visiting countries which have recently joined the European Union are expressing their doubts to me concerning their status in relation as compared with visitors who are citizens of the new Member States. Could the Commission say: 1. if visitors of the new Member States do not pay fees, are visitors who come from other Member States given the same status as this first category? 2. What steps does the Commission intend to take to deal with the issue of equal treatment of all visitors? 3. How should visitors react to such cases of contravention of Community law?
