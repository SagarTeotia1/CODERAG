Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (23 June 2008) The advice that the Commission got from scientists for anglerfish, megrims and Nephrops does not provide for any fishing mortality figures, and therefore the Commission is not able to compare their fishing mortality values with the F MSY value for northern hake The scientists however mention an overfished condition in 2005, which was the last year in which they carried out an analytical assessment for anglerfish and megrims in areas VII and VIII. The advice for Nephrops in the same area does not include any analytical figures or any other reference to the stock and therefore the Commission cannot refer to any F value. A reduction in effort for the fleet involved in the fishery of northern hake, in order to achieve a fishing mortality of 0.17, will increase the profitability of the fleet catching hake and other associated species in the medium to long term.
