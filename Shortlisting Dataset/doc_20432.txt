Question for written answer E-010208/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Dominique Vlasto (PPE) (9 November 2011) Subject: European policy on mountain areas The EU has no official definition of ‘mountain area’. As a result, even though these areas make up a third of EU territory in 21 Member States, targeted action at Community level to address their problems is difficult. Mountain areas face various natural handicaps, such as high elevation, which brings about a change in temperature and therefore in the environment, and topography, which reduces their accessibility. These natural phenomena, combined with an over-reliance on the primary and secondary sectors, have left mountain areas economically weak. Although many programmes have some impact on mountain areas, the lack of a specific policy undermines the effectiveness of the aid that the EU allocates to these disadvantaged natural areas, whether under the common agricultural policy or the territorial cohesion policy provided for in the Lisbon Treaty. 1. Does the Commission intend to establish a common definition of mountain areas in the EU, so that a comprehensive approach can be taken to their problems? 2. How could the Commission combine EU measures concerning mountain areas into a single policy in order to increase the effectiveness and visibility of the aid provided?
