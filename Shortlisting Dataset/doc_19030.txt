WRITTEN QUESTION E-3881/07 by Pierre Schapira (PSE) to the Commission (26 July 2007) Subject: Joint EU‑Africa strategy in the context of preparing Lisbon summit The Union is now preparing the Lisbon summit on a ‘joint Africa-EU strategy’. The local authorities are, however, not mentioned in the text adopted by the troika, and are scarcely mentioned in the Commission's text: these are the two basic documents for the preparation of this summit. As the rapporteur for the report on ‘local authorities and development cooperation’ ( A6-0039/2007 ), adopted by Parliament on 15 March 2007, I ask the Commission to add to these documents a specification on the role to be played by local authorities and decentralised cooperation, given that these will be the basic texts for the final declaration and future action plan to be adopted by the Lisbon summit.
