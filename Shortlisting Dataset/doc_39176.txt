Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (22 July 2011) Due to public concern and scientific uncertainty, the Commission has sustained a major research effort to elucidate the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields since 1999. It has spent over EUR 14 million in the Fifth and Sixth EU Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (FP5 1998‑2002); FP6 (2002‑06) both on targeted research projects to increase scientific knowledge and on coordinating research actions that aimed at consolidating the European scientific expertise on electromagnetic fields and health. For example, the well-known Interphone project http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/env_health_projects/electromagnetic_fields/e-interphone.pdf received EUR 3.8 million from the EU; many of the conclusions of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) were based on the outcome of this multi-centre project. The current Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research is funding three projects (EU contribution EUR 9.8 million) investigating the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields: MOBI-KIDS http://www.mbkds.com/ (the largest study in the world focused on risk of development of brain cancer related to mobile phone use in children and adolescents), Seawind http://seawind-fp7.eu/ (study focused on exposure and health risks of wireless technologies) and Arimmora (study aimed at finding a mechanistic explanation to the epidemiological correlation between exposure to extremely low frequency fields and childhood leukaemia) Publications:http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/env_health_projects/env_health_brochure.pdf, http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/eur23460_en.pdf, http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/pdf/fp7_catalogue_eh.pdf . At the end of 2011, the Commission will launch its own independent assessment of the evolving scientific evidence, taking into account the work by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and all relevant scientific evidence available at that time. Based on that assessment, the Commission will consider whether additional research is necessary and whether the exposure limits proposed by Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC Council Recommendation (1999/519/EC) of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0Hz‑300 GHz). are still adequate. In line with the Treaty, Member States are responsible for the protection of the general public from the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields. As a consequence, in the respect of the principles of the internal market provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union, they are free to make all recommendations and take all measures they feel necessary for the protection of the public.
