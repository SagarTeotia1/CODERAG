(Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7), the ICT policy support programme and the European operational programmes for intelligent energy), and whereas tax incentives and appropriate State-support instruments also provide financial backing and encouragement for intelligent energy-efficiency solutions, K. whereas industry and small- and medium-sized undertakings (SMUs) have a key role to play in increasing energy efficiency through the use of ICTs and innovation, 1. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to endeavour to increase awareness, for example through demonstration projects, of the importance of ICTs for improving energy efficiency in the EU economy and as driving forces behind increased productivity and growth and cost reductions that make for competitiveness, sustainable development and the improvement of EU citizens’ quality of life; 2. Suggests to the forthcoming Council Presidencies that they make the topic of ICTs and their importance in combating and adapting to climate change one of the priorities for their terms of office; 3. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to endeavour to harmonise energy efficiency-related criteria, approaches and changes to the law and to adopt an holistic approach, meaning that Member States should not only think of components but of entire systems (e.g. smart buildings), and urges the Commission to consider including in its Impact Assessment Guidelines an evaluation of potential energy savings through the use of ICT-based solutions; 4. Calls on those Member States which have not yet devised a green strategy based on the use of ITs/ICTs which is capable of contributing to a progressive reduction in the EU’s CO2 emissions to do so; 5. Calls on Member States to make further use of ‘green procurement’ in order to encourage the take-up of ICT solutions by their public services, which can set an example in promoting energy-efficient solutions; calls on the public sector, starting with the EU institutions, to make the greatest possible use of ‘paperless office’ policies, document management, e-governance, e-administration, teleworking and video- and teleconferencing; urges the Commission to take the lead by developing an action plan to reduce the energy consumption of EU institutions; 6. Emphasises that more efforts must be made at every level of decision-making to use all available financial tools (such as FP7, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the relevant operational programmes supported by the cohesion policy, and national and regional programmes) for the deployment and take-up of new ICT-based technological solutions which enhance energy efficiency; calls, further, on the Commission to stipulate that at least 5% of Structural Fund resources must be spent on improving the energy efficiency of existing homes; 7. Calls on the Commission to support a systematic approach to intelligent ICT solutions which places particular emphasis on lower emissions in connection with the development of towns and cities, in particular through the development of intelligent buildings, street lighting and transmission and distribution networks and through the real-time organisation of transport; 8. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the use of financial incentives for smart grid technologies; calls, further, on the Member States to encourage the use of
