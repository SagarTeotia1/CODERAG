In the context of the Open Method of Coordination in the field of social protection and social inclusion, all Member States have agreed to focus on reducing child poverty and social exclusion, and have developed measures in one or several of the following policy fields: — Ensuring sufficient resources for the families, by providing financial and in kind support for children and their families and at the same time promoting the labour market participation of parents, through the implementation of active inclusion strategies.
