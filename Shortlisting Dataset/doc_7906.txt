WRITTEN QUESTION P-5165/08 by Katrin Saks (PSE) to the Commission (23 September 2008) Subject: European Globalisation Adjustment Fund Given that the economic slowdown in the EU could increase the number of companies plunged into difficulty by globalisation, does the Commission think it necessary to speed up the review of the eligibility criteria for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund? When will a decision be taken to lower the threshold? In view of the experience in small countries, Estonia included, where the scale of redundancies has ranged from a few hundred to as many as 800 at a time, what sort of thresholds is the Commission envisaging? What kind of measures does the Commission believe to be necessary in order to simplify the application procedures, bearing in mind that the number of applications in 2007 was fairly low?
