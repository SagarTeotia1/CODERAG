ORAL QUESTION H-0352/06 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Panagiotis Beglitis to the Council Subject: Decision by the EU to suspend economic aid to the Palestinian authority On 10 April 2006, the Council of Foreign Ministers decided to freeze economic aid to the Palestinian authority in response to the refusal of the new Hamas Government to accept the terms laid by the international community and the European Union. Given that the EU recognised the democratic outcome of the elections, why is it now electing to punish the Palestinian people for the free democratic expression of their will? Since when has the European Union and Council of Ministers decided to impose economic sanctions on peoples and their democratically elected governments? How compatible is this decision with the EU's efforts to secure the democratisation of the countries of the Middle East? Does the EU not realise that this decision will prompt the Hamas leadership to seek economic aid from other countries, including Iran, with serious implications for the peace process? Why did the Council fail to act as swiftly and decisively in response to Israel's continued refusal to implement the November 2005 agreement concerning access to the Gaza Strip and freedom of movement therein and the terms of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and the EU-Israel Action Plan which are clearly worded and contain undertakings by Israel regarding the Palestinian authority?
