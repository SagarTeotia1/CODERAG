Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (18 September 2006) The Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its answer to his Written Question E‑2410/05 concerning alleged urban planning abuses in Cullera. In its answer, the Commission stated that, according to the information held by the Commission, the area stretching from the Júcar River to the Estany Lagoon in Cullera, where the urban developments are planned, has neither been classified as a Special Protection Area (SPA) — pursuant to Article 4 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC OJ L 103, 25.4.1979 . of 2 April 1979 on the protection of wild birds (the Birds Directive) — by the Spanish authorities nor is it included in the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) inventory for Spain. Therefore, it is not an area covered under EC nature legislation. This new question does not bring to light any elements that may lead the Commission to conclude that Community law is being breached in this specific case. The fact that a non-governmental organisation (NGO) considers that some undesirable effects may affect protected bird species listed in Annex I to the latter directive does not per se provide evidence that a breach of EC law might occur. It must be noted that, with regard to disturbances affecting birds, only the Birds Directive might apply, and its main provision concerning protection outside special protection areas, as is the case here, is the second sentence of Article 4, second paragraph of the directive: ‘Outside these protection areas, Member States shall also strive to avoid pollution or deterioration of habitats’. At this stage, nothing leads the Commission to believe that the competent authorities will not take into account this obligation during the authorisation and implementation of the relevant urban development projects.
