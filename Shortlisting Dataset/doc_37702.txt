Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2008) The Commission has not recently undertaken an analysis specifically focused on the situation in the Greek market. More general analyses show that the existence of differences in prices of individual types of fuels amongst various EU countries can be explained by a number of factors, including differences in local market structures, consumption patterns, supply alternatives and national energy policies. These factors can influence prices faced by local consumers despite the existence of a well-developed and integrated European Internal Market. It should also be recalled that prices in some EU countries are formed against the background of administrative measures setting maximum or minimum prices for specific fuels marketed in a given country. As regards ex-refinery fuel prices, it should be noted that petroleum product prices in Greece were liberalised in 1992 and distribution companies are, in principle, free to import products from refineries outside Greece. Given that prices can be influenced by local market imperfections and anti-competitive behaviour, the Commission closely monitors the situation in EU countries and vigorously pursues identified shortcomings in this regard. In the case of Greece, particularly in connection with fuel distribution channels, the Commission recently launched an infringement procedure for Article 43 of the EC Treaty with respect to the provisions of the Greek legislation related to transportation of goods, in particular transportation of oil products. A letter of formal notice was sent to the Greek Government in February 2008 and a final decision is expected by the end of 2008.
