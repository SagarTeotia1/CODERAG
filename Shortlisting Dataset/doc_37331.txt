WRITTEN QUESTION E-1516/08 by Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (17 March 2008) Subject: Liberalisation of the energy market In Italy, liberalisation of the electricity market was launched by means of Legislative Decree No 79 of 16 March 1999, which is known as the Bersani decree. That decree (by means of which the contents of Community Directive 96/92/EC OJ L 27, 30.01.1997, p. 20. were incorporated into national law as the first stage in the establishment of a single market in energy) signalled the start of the process of liberalising the production, import, export, purchase and sale of electricity. The hoped-for results have, however, largely failed to materialise. 1. Is the Commission not concerned at the fact that prices have not fallen, despite a liberalisation process which was intended to reduce them? 2. What view does the Commission take of the fact that one-third of users who change supplier opt by mistake for an arrangement which is less advantageous than their previous one, and what action is it intending to take in response to that fact? 3. Is the Commission intending to tighten up the requirements concerning the provision of information to consumers and to propose invoicing procedures for all operators? At present, each operator issues a different type of invoice, which makes such invoices difficult for consumers to interpret.
