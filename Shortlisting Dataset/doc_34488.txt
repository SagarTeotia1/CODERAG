WRITTEN QUESTION E-1047/07 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (2 March 2007) Subject: Carbon rating of retail products The retailing group Tesco recently announced (18 January 2007) that it would become the first supermarket chain to assign a carbon rating to its products, and that it would work with Oxford University’s environmental change institute to create an index to measure the carbon required to produce, transport and consume every product it sells. Carbon labels should help raise awareness about the climate impacts of individual products and ensure that consumer preferences are able to affect purchase decisions positively. However, the measurements involved are complex, and there is a severe risk that conflicting and competing schemes will be introduced. The inadequacies of some may reduce confidence in all. Will the Commission take a lead in coordinating efforts to create measurement indices and/or to endorse such indices that provide an accurate assessment of carbon use?
