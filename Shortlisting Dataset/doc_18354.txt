Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (14 April 2008) 1. The Commission closed the infringement case for non-communication against the Netherlands on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive Directive 2002/91/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings, OJ L 1, 4.1.2003. on 17 October 2007 due to notifications on all Articles of this directive by the Netherlands. In-depth analysis of these notifications is ongoing for an assessment whether the Netherlands fully comply with the legal obligations of this directive or not. The Commission may then consider opening an infringement case for non-compliance if there is a need to do so. 2. Until the Commission has fully analysed the abovementioned notifications, it cannot undertake any further legal action.
