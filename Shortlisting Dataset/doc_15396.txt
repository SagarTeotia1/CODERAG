WRITTEN QUESTION E-0358/08 by Ashley Mote (NI) to the Commission (4 February 2008) Subject: Would Commissioners consider their positions if caught lying to MEPs — Mark 2 Since the answer to my Written Question E‑3106/07 about Commissioners caught lying to MEPs was that it is not Commission policy to answer hypothetical questions, may I re-phrase it thus: Are any rules in place to deal with Commissioners caught lying to MEPs? If not, why not? The earlier answer implies that no such rules are in place. Is that the case?
