prosperity, higher exports and increased investment, delivering benefits to businesses and consumers alike. Still, almost 15 years since its coming into existence (on 1 January 1993), the EU's Single Market remains a work in progress. MEPs make clear their vision of a Single Market for the 21st century in an own-initiative report by Jacques TOUBON (EPP-ED, FR). In the report adopted by 534 votes in favour, 119 against and 27 abstentions, the House welcome the Commission’s work on the Single Market Review (SMR), noting that the Review - which aims to review existing mechanisms and to identify gaps - is an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits to be reaped from the effective implementation of the internal market. As MEPs underline, an improvement in the functioning of the Single Market is still necessary. "There is a need", reads the report, "to complete the opening of network industries, such as transport, telecommunications, postal services and energy transport." Procurement rules The report also stresses that public contracts must be awarded in a fair and transparent manner, observing public procurement rules, and that they may also help promote innovation and technological development and help respond to environmental and social concerns, including accessibility for disabled people. The Parliament calls on the Commission to encourage Member States to improve access for SMEs to public procurement contracts and to apply pre-commercial procurement to improve the innovative capacity of the Single Market. The report, authored by Jacques TOUBON (EPP-ED, FR), focuses on a number of areas where room for improvement is visible and reforms necessary. To that effect, the European Parliament: - believes the greater harmonisation may be necessary in certain areas, in particular in retail financial services (including means of payment) and in the functioning of the tax system; - holds the view that tackling climate change and ensuring sustainable development are of paramount importance, and can be achieved only with a balanced energy mix, and that a Single Market policy promoting sustainable and competitive energy is vital to those ends; - regrets that insufficient emphasis was placed on the potential contribution of nuclear power; - urges the Commission to adopt a global strategy concerning intellectual property rights, highlighting the importance of establishing a Community Patent; - underlines the importance of a SM policy promoting sustainable and competitive energy -- regretting, however, "that insufficient emphasis [is] placed on the potential contribution of nuclear power"; - points out that 25% of the goods manufactured in the European Union are still not covered by harmonisation measures. The report calls on Member States, therefore, to make full use of the principle of mutual recognition to ensure the free movement of goods in the interest of consumers and businesses - insists on the pursuit of harmonisation in key areas, in particular retail financial services (including means of payment) and taxation; - urges the Commission to push ahead with its proposals concerning a common consolidated corporate tax base; - stresses the importance of encouraging the free movement of workers within the internal market; - welcomes the Commission's initiatives to identify common principles on Services
