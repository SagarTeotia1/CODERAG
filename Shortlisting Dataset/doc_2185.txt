Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (4 January 2012) The European Union (EU) Basic Safety Standards Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation, OJ 159, 29.6.2011 . require Member States to prepare for nuclear emergency situations and test their intervention plans, including the evacuation of the population close to the accident site, at regular intervals. There are no intervention plans at European level. Evacuation plans need to be established and kept updated for the population living in the areas potentially affected by a radioactive release. In addition to the implementation of countermeasures, the exercises are used to test communication arrangements, both locally as required by Council Directive 89/618/Euratom Council Directive 89/618/Euratom of 27 November 1989 on informing the general public about health protection measures to be applied and steps to be taken in the event of a radiological emergency, OJ L 357, 7.12.1989. and at EU level as required by Council Decision 87/600/Euratom.
