to other waste for which such treatment does not contribute to the abovementioned objectives of Directive 2006/12/EC. Provision 2.2.3 of Decision 2003/33/EC lays down specific technical requirements for the acceptance of gypsum waste in landfills, such as its disposal in cells isolated from biodegradable waste in landfills for non-hazardous waste. Provision 15 of the United Kingdom (UK) Statutory Instrument 2004 No 1375 entitled ‘The Landfill (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2004’ literally transposes point 2.2.3 of Decision 2003/33/EC into national legislation. Therefore, the transposition of the UK legal act is regarded as being in line with the decision. However, if the Honourable Member possesses further information proving otherwise, the Commission would appreciate receiving it for a close follow-up. This would also be applicable in cases where the lack of implementation or inadequate implementation of the provisions of Council Decision 2003/33/EC in other Member States is known and information is available.
