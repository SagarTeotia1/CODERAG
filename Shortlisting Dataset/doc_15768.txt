at Doha committed themselves to a comprehensive strategy for trade-related capacity-building; notes also that this could provide the basis for bilateral and multilateral donors to ensure that market access, trade-related technical assistance, special and differential treatment is well integrated into the all EU's current and future technical assistance/development cooperation programming as a matter of the highest priority; 19. Recalls that Doha was just the start of a process of negotiation comprising both further trade liberalisation and new rule-making that will last until January 2005, and therefore its impact depends on the forthcoming negotiations; 20. Takes the view that, if the problems in the areas of social injustice, development and the environment caused by the untrammelled liberalisation of trade and deregulation are to be resolved, a serious assessment of the Uruguay Round agreements and their implementation must be drawn up, as promised to the developing countries in Marrakech; 21. Calls for the WTO to be extended to include the environment as an essential element in its decision-making; 22. Notes that the Doha Declaration refers to comprehensive negotiations on agriculture aimed at the reduction of all forms of export subsidies, implying an EU commitment to reducing export subsidies provided that export subsidies by others (export credits, abusive use of food aid and non transparent pricing activities of state trading bodies) are also addressed; calls for the launching of new reforms from 2004, beginning with the reduction by 50% of all export subsidies in one year and the abolition of all the other subsidies as soon as possible by the EU and the USA; 23. Regrets the decision taken by the House of Representatives on 6 May 2002 to approve the US Farm Bill and believes that this could destabilise the hard-won agreement which was reached on agriculture at the Doha Ministerial Meeting; believes that this decision should not prevent the EU from respecting the commitment agreed in Doha to reduce with a view to phasing out all forms of export subidies and trade distorting support mechanisms for agriculture and insists that the US also does so; 24. Notes that in some developing countries, government procurement contracts remain one of the only ways to steer economic development by enabling local industry to develop; regrets that the Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) Agreement comprehensively bans any laws, policies or administrative regulations promoting domestic products which runs contrary to the EU's declared intention to help build capacity in the developing countries; notes that this ban includes government incentives to encourage corporations to use domestically made products as a way of creating or protecting local jobs; stresses this has serious ramifications for industrial policies designated to support the development of domestic capacity, secure flow-on benefits from foreign investment supplying both the local and export markets and limit the effects of foreign competition; 25. Takes the view that Community policies, particularly in the areas of trade liberalisation, agriculture, fisheries, the environment and public health, must be revised with a view to taking greater account of their impact on poverty, food security, sustainable development and the links between these phenomena; 26.
