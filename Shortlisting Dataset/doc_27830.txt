Question for written answer E-003555/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Csanád Szegedi (NI) (11 April 2011) Subject: Self-determination for Érmellék One of the historical legacies within the European Union which still gives rise to emotions and tensions between Member States is the failure to resolve the situation of Hungarian minorities. The people in question form Europe’s largest indigenous national minority, which even today has no cultural and regional self-determination. In view of the many European examples of successful regional and cultural autonomy which have been set up, peacefully or otherwise, I would like to ask the Commission the following: 1. Does it agree with the principle of regional and cultural autonomy being granted at European level to a significant number of minorities in well-delineated areas, as is already happening? 2. Would it support cultural and regional self-determination and autonomy for the Hungarians living in Érmellék (Partium), which borders Hungary? 3. Is it aware of the ethnic changes taking place in the areas inhabited by Hungarians as a result of an aggressive settlement policy? What action does it intend to take in response? 4. Does it agree that regional autonomy represents a way of promoting cooperation and cohesion between regions? 5. Does it support a European-level settlement procedure guaranteeing Hungarian minorities living in central and eastern European countries, including those in the region of Érmellék (Partium), the right to self-determination? 6. If so, does it agree that this kind of procedure might reduce the historical tensions between Member States, in line with the principles and spirit of the European Union?
