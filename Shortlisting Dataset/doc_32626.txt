Question for written answer E-012051/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (20 December 2011) Subject: Checks made by the Commission on imported toys The European consumer organisations ANEC (The European consumer voice in standardisation) and BEUC (Bureau européen des unions de consommateurs) have criticised as inadequate tests carried out on toys imported into the EU and said that provisions concerning chemicals in Directive 2009/48/EC will not be fully implemented by 20 July 2013. Their concerns arise from tests carried out in November 2011 by the Stiftung Warentest, an independent German consumer safety foundation, which found that one out of every six toys did not meet safety standards for children’s health. In light of this: — Has the Commission asked Member States to introduce more stringent controls to ensure the directive is fully implemented? — What measures have been adopted in regard to internal-market surveillance? — Has the Commission considered the calls made in Parliament’s resolution of 8 March 2011 on the revision of the General Product Safety Direction and market surveillance? What proposals has it advanced to this end?
