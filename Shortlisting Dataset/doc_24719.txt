Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (7 December 2006) Until now, the Commission has not proposed, adopted or published any separate directive on health services. The College of Commissioners held an orientation debate on 5 September 2006 on health services and agreed to launch a public consultation to better frame any future Community action in this field, also taking into account recent European Court of Justice (ECJ) case law. Following the orientation debate, the Commission finally adopted on 26 September 2006 a Communication Available online: http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_overview/co_operation/mobility/community_framework_en.htm formally opening up the consultation process due to be completed by the end of January 2007. Upon the completion of the consultation phase the Commission will present the appropriate legislative instrument. The Commission’s 2007 Work Programme — presented to Parliament by the President of the Commission in Strasbourg on 14 November 2006 — includes the relevant point as one of the Commission priorities for the first semester.
