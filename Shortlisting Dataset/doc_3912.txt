WRITTEN QUESTION E-5207/08 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (30 September 2008) Subject: New accounting rules for the property sector It is expected that in 2009 the EU will give its blessing to a so-called IFRS accounting rule which will for the first time enable listed property companies to revalue construction projects which are under way and to include these revaluation gains in their balance sheets. Hitherto, only completed projects could be revalued. In boom periods revaluation was a ‘traditional’ practice; in the recent, tighter financial market value adjustments upwards have become rare. Whilst listed property companies naturally expect the new property accounting rules to bring about an upturn, some analysts, managers and investment security experts consider them to be dangerous for the financial market and are warning of negative consequences. Not only will balance sheets drawn up under the new rules scarcely reflect the real value of companies; the additional revaluation gains will make it very hard for the investor to understand which values are shown in the books, and this will bring with it an increase in uncertainty and volatility. Moreover, critics say that the way will be open for unjustified abuse of revaluation; they point out that firms will find it hard to resist additional opportunities to increase their profits, which will lead to inflated evaluations in the medium term resulting in downward adjustments that will bring uncertainty to the market. 1. How far advanced are the plans for the new property accounting rules and to what extent has account been taken, or will account be taken, of the objections made by critics? 2. How can the uncertainty provoked by the planned changes be reconciled with the rules on stabilisation and risk minimisation brought in after the Enron and Worldcom scandals? 3. What means are there of preventing fictitious and premature revaluations being made of projects on as yet unbuilt sites?
