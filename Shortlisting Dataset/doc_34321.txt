European Union and its Member States in promoting legal instruments aimed at controlling all international public and private arms transfers, notably the Arms Trade Treaty, 1. Deplores the current political impasse on the adoption of this Common Position, in the light of the tenth anniversary of the Code; 2. Calls on the Slovenian Presidency to make the adoption of the Common Position a permanent item on the agenda of each General Affairs Council meeting until such time as the issue has been resolved; 3. Urges those EU Member States that are opposed to a legally binding Code to reconsider their position; 4. Believes that the EU's contribution to an internationally binding Arms Trade Treaty will gain in credibility as soon as its own arms control regime becomes legally binding; 5. Is convinced also that, in parallel with the adoption of the Common Position, action should be taken, inter alia , to: a) prevent irresponsible arms transfers by strict application of the Code's criteria to both companies and national armed forces; b) improve and apply brokering controls, and prevent illegal arms trafficking by air and sea; c) ensure prompt investigation of recent allegations of violations of arms embargoes; d) prevent the selling-off to private brokers of arms collected in the course of ESDP and SSR operations and other EU initiatives and their subsequent transfer; e) improve the transparency and quality of data submitted by Member States in the context of the Annual Report on the Code; 6. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
