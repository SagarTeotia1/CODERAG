Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (12 May 2011) 1. According to information gathered systematically and regularly from Member States' authorities, commercial operators in all Member States have managed to replace Libyan crude oil supplies and/or petroleum products by supplies from alternative sources. The replacement is reported as complete, smooth and sustainable over the long term. 2. As the replacement of Libyan crude oil exports and petroleum products has been complete to date, neither the integrity of supplies to EU consumers nor the integrity of refining operations in the EU has come under pressure that would lead to price increases. The fuel price increases observed in the EU in recent weeks are rather due to a general increase of crude oil price in the global market. 3. The Commission does not collect data on the exact configuration and specifications of individual EU refineries.
