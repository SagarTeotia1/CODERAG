Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (23 February 2007) The Commission is aware of the issues presented by ‘Transport en Logistiek Nederland’ (TLN) in its Grey Paper. As far as the administrative burden connected to the digital tachograph is concerned, it has to be seen always in relation to the social and economic costs caused by the fraudulent use of the analogue tachograph. In this respect, the introduction of the digital tachograph has certainly delivered its contribution to road safety and fair competition. As regards the administrative costs, calculated by TLN for the Dutch market, it must be noted that the Member States have all chosen their own methods for financing the digital tachograph system, in particular as regards the issuing of driver cards. Furthermore, the level of the costs also depends on the way the digital tachograph is used. For example, the period of 28 minutes for downloading data from the digital tachograph, as mentioned in the TLN paper, can be reduced considerably if only specific parts of the data are downloaded. A further reduction will be reachable due to the ongoing technical progress and better processing power of the equipment. In other words, many of the problems encountered by transport operators are not linked specifically to the technical setting of the digital tachograph. Some of them can be reduced by making better use of all the technical possibilities offered by the equipment. To a certain extent the modalities for use depend also on the national legislation being more or less demanding. The Commission will continue to analyse the experience with the introduction of the digital tachograph, also in light of the new rules on driving times and rest periods.
