WRITTEN QUESTION E-0252/05 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Council (2 February 2005) Subject: Social Platform involvement in the Troika meeting The Social Platform has informed me that the Luxembourgish Presidency has decided not to invite the social NGOs Troika meeting preceding the informal Employment and Social Affairs Council to be held on 8 and 9 April 2005, contrary to what has been standard practice since the Portuguese Presidency. It is urgent that this decision be reviewed, so as to allow the Social Platform to take part and present its proposals, as the representative of the various most vulnerable groups, with a view to finding the requisite ways of achieving greater social inclusion. What final decision will the Council be adopting with regard to the involvement of the Social Platform?
