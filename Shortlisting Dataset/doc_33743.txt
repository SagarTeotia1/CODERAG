9999/C Q999 E/098 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2412/03 by Charlotte Cederschiöld (PPE-DE) to the Commission (10 July 2003) Subject: Network and information security The European Parliament together with industry have welcomed the Commission proposal for a Regulation establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency. What other steps is the Commission envisaging in order to accelerate the Union's network and information security agenda? Can we expect any initiatives taking a global approach to these issues? Can we expect the dialogue between policy-makers and parties with an interest in the field to continue and even intensify, e.g. within such fora as the Cybercrime Forum?
