Answer given by Mr Bolkestein on behalf of the Commission (21 December 2001) Certain fiscal matters have been subject to harmonisation within the Community. This is the case for valued added tax and for excise duties on tobacco, alcohol and mineral oils. There has been no harmonisation of taxes on forest products. The Member States therefore remain free to levy the taxes they see fit on these products, as long as they respect the general principles of the EC Treaty. Article 90 (ex Article 95) of the EC Treaty prohibits discriminatory taxation by which a Member State gives an advantage to its domestic products as compared to the products of other Member States. However, this article does not prohibit fiscal measures which put a Member State's own products at a disadvantage compared to products of other Member States. In view of this, the Commission has no intention to take measures in respect of the levy on forest products in Greece.
