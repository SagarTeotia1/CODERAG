OJ L 347, 11.12.2006. . These provisions set out a legal framework for the application of VAT rates in the Member States. According to these rules Member States may apply the reduced VAT rates only to the categories of goods and services specified in the annex III to the VAT Directive, which includes television broadcasting and the printed press. Prior to the recent decision by the Italian authorities to impose the standard rate of VAT — 20 % in Italy on all encrypted TV services — i.e on all pay TV services — only those encrypted services delivered by cable or satellite could benefit from the lower rate of VAT, while those delivered by terrestrial did not, as encrypted terrestrial services were not mentioned in the Italian law. This posed a problem of fiscal neutrality. Two solutions were possible to resolve this asymmetry: either to levy a low rate of 10 % on all encrypted TV services or to levy the standard rate on all encrypted TV services. The Italian authorities chose the second option. The Commission had no role in the decision on which rate to apply. To conclude, media policy is an area where Member States have considerable discretion in line with the subsidiarity principle. The Commission is currently developing a monitoring mechanism for media pluralism through a study being undertaken by independent consultants, which will be the subject of further political debate once the work has been concluded and following feedback from stakeholders.
