WRITTEN QUESTION E-2364/05 by Jan Ehler (PPE-DE) to the Commission (1 July 2005) Subject: Renewable energy sources The Commission is planning to submit a regular report — beginning in autumn 2005 — reviewing progress with regard to the development and use of renewable energy sources. 1. For how long, in the Commission's view, will facilities for producing renewables need to continue to receive support? 2. When, in the Commission's view, will production facilities become economic? (Could the Commission give a breakdown according to individual energy sources?) 3. What average specific costs (EUR/MWh) are forecast for Europe as a whole, and broken down by Member State, for support for renewable energy sources? Do these costs reflect regional differences and the availability of individual renewable energy sources? 4. How likely is it, in the Commission's view, that national support schemes could be radically changed following a change of government in the Member States? Is this a reason for harmonising national support schemes? 5. Will the complete opening up of the internal market in July 2007 lead to a need to harmonise national schemes for supporting renewable energy sources?
