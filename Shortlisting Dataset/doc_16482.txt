While the committee generally welcomes the proposal, it regrets that "it was not more ambitious" and that "it does not cover the entry conditions for all third-country nationals wishing to pursue an economic activity in the EU". However, Member States’ reluctance with regard to such a proposal is understandable, it says. Member States rights not affected MEPs in the committee consider it important to make clear that "the content of this directive does not affect the Member States’ right to determine the entry conditions nor the number of migrants they wish to admit to their territory". In addition, "the period of validity of the single permit is to be determined by each Member State," says the report drafted by Patrick GAUBERT (EPP-ED, FR). "The procedure in no way interferes with the Member States’ competence as far as the processing of requests is concerned, only as regards the time limit which needs to be complied with". The directive complements the EU's Blue Card plan The single application procedure is meant to complement the EU's Blue Card plan, which seeks to attract skilled workers. Adopting the two simultaneously would therefore avoid a "twin-speed immigration policy", which favours highly-skilled workers and refuses access to those who are less skilled, the report emphasises. The single procedure The proposal for a Directive seeks to put in place a single application procedure leading to the issuing of a single residence and work permit. The report claims there are several advantages to this, including simplified administration and less bureaucratic procedures. The common set of rights Currently in the EU there are major differences among the Member States regarding the treatment of migrant workers. Equal treatment of third-country nationals in Member States, particularly in areas connected with employment "must be guaranteed", says the committee, and granting these rights "is a minimum requirement".
