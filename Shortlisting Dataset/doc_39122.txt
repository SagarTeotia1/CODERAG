research project on bee decline, in line with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 OJ L 31, 1.2.2002. , to analyse the information received from the Member States. This project entitled ‘Bee mortality and bee surveillance in Europe’ was recently completed and the final report has been published on EFSA's website http://www.efsa.europa.eu/ EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1211903101339.htm . In general, the report considers that the causes of colony losses in Europe are likely to be multifactorial and it highlights the need for better harmonised surveillance on bee mortality in the EU. The Commission will carefully assess the conclusions and the recommendations of the report and will consider which further actions should be undertaken in relation to this topic.
