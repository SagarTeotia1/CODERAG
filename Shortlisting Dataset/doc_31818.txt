Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2011) 1. A 2009 communication on ‘Better access for Rural areas to modern information and communication technologies’ http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/rurdev/employment/ict/com2009_103_en.pdf targeted the deployment of these services in rural areas. The annex to the communication http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/rurdev/employment/ict/sec2009_254_en.pdf provides references to good practice projects (financed by EU funds) that develop ICT services in support of a range of services for rural areas For a more comprehensive list of example see http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/external/networks/fulltext_en.pdf . The examples include services supporting on–line trade and e-commerce, and providing online information enabling the establishment of new and better trade relationships between farmers, food processors, intermediates and retailers, and final clients as well as a range of other services assisting business and life in rural areas. 2. The Commission is supporting the deployment of ICT services and infrastructure in rural areas both through Cohesion and Rural Development Policies. The European Economic Recovery Package included support for the provision of broadband infrastructure to rural areas. About EUR 360 millions have been programmed to provide access to this critical infrastructure to businesses and households located in rural areas in Europe out of 1 billion euro made available within that Package 4. 3. The Commission is aware of the benefits that these services can bring to farmers in the EU. Public administrations can take action to make available relevant data and support the realisation of these services through state funds in compliance with EU state aid rules. The Commission, in addition to the financing access to broadband infrastructure and ICT services for rural areas, it facilitates the exchange of good practices. 4. The Commission is in the process of formulating the proposal for the next CAP policy under the Multi- Annual Financial Framework for 2014‑20. The priorities that will make the new CAP and rural development policies more innovative and in line with the European 2020 objectives for an smart, sustainable and inclusive growth will also provide for support possibilities among which the financing of ICT services and access to broadband infrastructure will feature prominently.
