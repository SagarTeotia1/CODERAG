Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2007) According to the proposal for the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector, producer organisations have the possibility to include crisis management measures in their operational programmes. Furthermore, the proposal for the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector provides that crisis management measures may not comprise more than one third of the expenditure under the operational programme. Since the threshold of one third is a maximum limit and crisis management is voluntary for producer organisations, the Commission considers that there is no reason to fear an excessive use of the operational funds for crisis management. With regard to environmental measures, since the 1996 Reform, the fruit and vegetables regime has been a pioneer in environmental terms. In fact, it was the first common market organisation (CMO) to integrate payments for environmental services into the CMO itself with the additional merit of making these a compulsory element for producer organisations. Nevertheless, after 10 years, it is not enough. Producers still have to make an effort to improve the current situation. Devoting 20 % of the operational funds to environmental measures is a good step to continue the efforts made by the sector to maintain and protect the environment.
