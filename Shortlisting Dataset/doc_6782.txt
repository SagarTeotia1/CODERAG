Joint answer to Written Questions E-0888/03 , E-1186/03 , E-1187/03 , E-1188/03 , E-1189/03 and E-1190/03 given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (15 May 2003) The municipalities of Fiumicino, Livorno, Massa, Carrara, Ancona and Pesaro may present projects for funding from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG) under the fisheries single programming document (SPD), which covers all areas in Italy outside Objective 1 for the period 2000-2006. Initiatives eligible for part-financing under the programme concern not only assistance for the fishing fleet, but also projects relating inter alia to installing artificial reefs to protect aquatic resources, constructing or converting aquaculture installations, equipping fishing ports, constructing and converting installations for processing and marketing fishery products, improving fishing in inshore waters and small-scale coastal fishing, as well as socio-economic measures. Responsibility for managing the SPD rests with the Directorate-General for Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Policy which, in turn, has delegated management of measures not concerning the fishing fleet to the fishery departments of the various regional authorities. As the SPD managing authority, the Ministry sends the Commission an annual progress report by 30 April each year in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 366/2001 Commission Regulation (EC) No 366/2001 of 22 February 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing the measures provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 , OJ L 55, 24.2.2001 . . According to the information obtained via the Ministry and the regions concerned, at 31 December 2002 none of the above municipalities had presented projects as final beneficiaries but, in each of those same municipalities, projects had been presented by other beneficiaries (fishermen, fishing cooperatives and businesses).
