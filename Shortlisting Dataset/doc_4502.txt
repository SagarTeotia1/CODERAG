WRITTEN QUESTION P-1114/09 by Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM) to the Commission (20 February 2009) Subject: Farm waste management Irish farmers were obliged under EC law transposed into national law to commit to substantial capital investment in order to comply with Nitrates Directive 91/676/EC OJ L 375, 31.12.1991, p. 1 . . It is estimated that over 34 000 farmers have spent over EUR 2 billion in the last two years. They were due to be repaid 60 % of this for work completed by the deadline of 31 December 2008. It is estimated that they borrowed over EUR 500 million in bridging finance to carry out the required projects. Now, because of budgetary restraints, the Minister of Agriculture has announced that these payments cannot be made as promised in 2009, but will be phased over two more years until January 2011. This has placed a heavy burden on 17 000 farmers who have not yet been paid. The farmers committed to carrying out these expensive projects because EC law required them to do so. They had to complete them by a fixed date in order to receive a promised grant payment. It appears that the Irish Government is in breach of contract by not honouring their promises. Does the Commission consider that the Irish Government is in breach of Community law by deferring the payments to farmers under the Farm Waste Management Scheme? What recourse do they have under EC law?
