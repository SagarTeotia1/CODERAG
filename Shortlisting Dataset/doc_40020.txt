9999/C Q999 E/031 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0429/04 by John Bowis (PPE-DE) to the Commission (05 February 2004) Subject: The case of rev. Rinaldy Damanik, Indonesia Is the Commission aware that the Rev. Rinaldy Damanik was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for possessing illegal weapons, in what is alleged to be a politically motivated trial? The Palu High Court has since upheld the verdict of the State Court and Rev. Damanik's lawyers are now preparing an appeal to the Supreme Court in Jakarta. As the head of the Crisis Centre in Central Sulawesi, he was responsible for keeping the international community informed about human rights violations against Christian and Muslim communities and providing practical assistance to the many internally displaced persons, including the evacuation of Christians under attack from militants. Will the Commission enquire into his welfare and the process that led to his arrest and trial?
