of entitlements acquired in either country to the other regarding length of service in skilled employment or social security; 10. Calls on the Commission, in designing a European framework for economic migration, to take into account the different policies and experiences existing in the Member States, and stresses that a constant evaluation of the impact of migration policy on other EU policies, including trade policy, should be carried out; 11. Calls on the Commission to create cooperation mechanisms with emigrants' countries to prevent migration having detrimental effects on the economies and societies of the countries of origin and to enhance the positive impact of migration on their economies; 12. Considers that, in the interests of social cohesion, workers from third countries should be guaranteed the terms and conditions of employment and minimum social standards which apply in the receiving country; 13. Stresses that multilateral and bilateral agreements to manage migratory flows should guarantee a status of third-country migrant throughout the European Union, which should confer rights of citizenship and social and political rights; 14. Emphasises the importance of ensuring that the discussions on trade in services, which form an important part of the Doha Development Agenda, and decisions on free movement of services within the EU follow an equally open and consistent approach; 15. Considers it vital that a European economic migration policy should also comprise practical solutions to the problem of the brain drain; 16. Recalls that problems within the EU labour market should be solved not only by economic migration but also by stimulating innovation, new technologies, increasing productivity and by encouraging the employment of older workers in the EU; 17. Favours the possibility of making entry conditions more flexible and effective, with provision for a residence permit for purposes of employment, minimum standards for the admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of working either as employees or as self-employed persons, and residence and work permits for seasonal workers or limited employment; 18. Calls on the Commission to propose specific measures to promote voluntary financial transfers by migrants to their countries of origin.
