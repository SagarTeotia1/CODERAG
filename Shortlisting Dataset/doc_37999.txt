Question for written answer P-003740/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Saïd El Khadraoui (S&D) (14 April 2011) Subject: Ryanair: supplement to cover compensation paid to passengers The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has announced that it will be charging a new supplement of EUR 2 per ticket to cover the costs of compensation to passengers. The regulation on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights (Regulation No 261/2004) lays down that, if a flight is cancelled or subject to a long delay, the airline must pay compensation to passengers under several headings. These include reimbursement of the ticket price and the right to assistance, a meal and overnight accommodation, plus in some cases additional compensation of up to EUR 600. Ryanair considers it unfair that only the airlines have to bear this cost. Regulation No 1028/2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community also includes provisions on ticket pricing. 1. Is the Commission aware of this new charge which Ryanair wishes to introduce? 2. Does this charge comply with the provisions of Regulation No 261/2004 and Regulation No 1008/2008? 3. If this charge is allowed, will the Commission ensure that revenue from this charge is actually used to pay compensation? If so, how will it do this?
