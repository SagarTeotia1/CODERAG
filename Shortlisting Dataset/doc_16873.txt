A). Overall 36 % of the Marie Curie Fellows that participated in the study have obtained permanent positions, and this figure goes up to about 50 % when tenure track positions (position for more than three years) are taken into account. When considering the type of a researcher, 40 % of the early stage researchers (doctoral level fellowships) have either a permanent or a tenure track position, while this figure goes up to 60 % for the experienced researchers (post-doc level up to 10 years of research experience), and 75 % for the senior researchers (defined as researchers with more than 10 years research experience). Furthermore a study will be launched in 2012 to address the issue of researchers' employability.
