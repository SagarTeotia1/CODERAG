The worst affected of the Member States can record 50 000 fires each year. The number of fires has increased in the last 10 years and is extending beyond the Mediterranean regions, turning this into a general problem, which affects the whole of Europe. In 2009, Bulgaria and Sweden were affected by serious forest fires, as well as other European forests during the summer of 2010, e.g. 164 ha of pines were ravaged in the south-west of France, while Portugal, Spain and Greece were also affected. Forest fires are mainly started by human action: 90 % of fires are of human origin. Since the repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92 there has no longer been a specific forest policy on the prevention of fire risks. In the light of this, and following the publication of the Green Paper on 'Forest Protection and Information in the EU: Preparing forests for climate change' on 1 March 2010, is the Commission taking account of prevention measures against forest fires? What progress has been made in terms of concrete measures? Is the Commission preparing further preventive measures in this field?
