Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (25 April 2008) According to Article 6(3) of the Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. , any plan or project not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the site but likely to have a significant effect thereon, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects, shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site's conservation objectives. In the light of the conclusions of the assessment, the competent national authorities shall agree to the plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned and, if appropriate, after having obtained the opinion of the general public. If the assessment shows that significant negative effects on the site are to be expected, then the project can only be authorised in the absence of an alternative solution, if it is justified by imperative reasons of overriding public interest and if appropriate compensatory measures are taken to protect the coherence of the Natura 2000 network. It is the responsibility of the competent authorities in each Member State to assess whether or not the construction of the fence in the Flora Fauna Habitat area ‘Steilhänge der Saar’ falls under the category of projects targeted by Article 6(3), and if so, to make sure that the relevant provisions are being applied.
