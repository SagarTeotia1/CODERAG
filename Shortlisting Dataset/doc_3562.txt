On 23 June 2006, the European Commission announced that it will make a contribution of €105 million to the Temporary International Mechanism for the Palestinians. This Mechanism, developed by the EU at the request of the “ Quartet ” (EU, US, UN and Russia) and endorsed by the European Council, will facilitate the direct delivery of assistance to the Palestinian people to meet basic needs, without the money passing to or through the PA government.
