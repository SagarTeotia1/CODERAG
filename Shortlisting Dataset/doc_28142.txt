WRITTEN QUESTION E-2664/10 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 April 2010) Subject: Defence of a universal postal service and jobs with rights In a recent meeting with union representatives of employees of the Portuguese Post Office (CTT Correios de Portugal), I was informed of the problems which are now making themselves felt almost everywhere in Portugal as a result of the externalisation and subcontracting of services instigated by the company's management — a process which can only damage the interests of both its workers and the public. It is feared that these measures reflect the liberalisation proposals which have been submitted for the postal services sector. 1. Will the Commission review the proposed timetable and procedures for the liberalisation of postal services, in order to take account of the adverse consequences already being felt by the workers and the public? 2. Does the Commission not believe that at a time when unemployment is widespread, employment is increasingly a matter of ill-paid and insecure jobs and poverty and social exclusion are rife, it is necessary as a matter of urgency to put an end to the process of liberalisation, and in particular in the case of postal services?
