WRITTEN QUESTION E-4455/08 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Commission (4 August 2008) Subject: Measuring the effectiveness of Frontex Frontex is one of the most important agencies to have been set up in the last few years. It may make a valuable contribution in the fight against illegal immigration. Does the Commission not also consider it appropriate for formulate rules on the storage of data to permit better evaluation of the results and impact of operations? In particular, would it not also be appropriate to obtain the best possible picture of the real identity of the people who are arrested and expelled, and of the extent to which operations actually contribute to reducing — rather than merely displacing — illegal immigration?
