WRITTEN QUESTION E-3518/04 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (5 January 2005) Subject: Public lending rights What response, if any, has the Commission received from the Irish Government as a reaction to the reasoned opinion issued to Ireland in July 2004 (as announced in IP/04/891) regarding Ireland's apparent failure to fully comply with the Directive on Public Lending Rights - Directive 1992/100/EE OJ L 346, 27.11.1992, p. 61 . 1? Which establishments in Ireland does it believe should not be classified as ‘exempted institutions’ under this Directive? Why has the Commission launched this challenge, given its comment that the ‘exclusive PLR is not infringed by the lending of items without any remuneration by educational establishments and establishments to which members of the public have access in Ireland’ (page 10, 12 September 2002 Commission report on the public lending right in the European Union - COM(2002) 502 final)? Could the Commission provide an overview of the types of institutions that are not included in the list of exempted lending institutions by other Member States and outline the most recent conclusions that it has drawn regarding the impact of this Directive on lending institutions across the EU?
