Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (29 August 2005) The Commission is aware of the very serious human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar. The Commission therefore welcomed the announcement made at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on 26 June 2005 that Burma/Myanmar would not be taking up the chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006. This decision allows the EU to keep up the momentum in EU-ASEAN relations. At the same time, however, it does not in any way reduce the need for urgent and concrete progress in the reconciliation and democratisation process in Burma/Myanmar. The Commission will continue to closely monitor the human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar, while at the same time continuing to provide humanitarian aid and assistance to the population in Burma/Myanmar in sectors such as health, livelihoods and environmental support.
