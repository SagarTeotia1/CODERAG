Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (17 January 2011) The EU pursues the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wines and spirits outside the EU through multilateral negotiations in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and through bilateral agreements. On the multilateral level, the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property rights (TRIPS) includes provisions on ‘geographical indications’, which cover the European Protected Designations of Origin or Protected Geographical Indications. The TRIPS defines a minimum level of protection for Geographical Indications which the WTO Members have to provide in order to avoid misleading the public and to prevent unfair competition. In addition, the TRIPS provides for an enhanced level of protection for wines and spirits. In the framework of the current Doha Round negotiations, the EU is actively pursuing the objective of facilitating the protection of Geographical Indications through a proposal for (1) the extension of the higher level of protection now only granted to Geographical Indications for wines and spirits to Geographical Indications for all products and (2) the creation of a multilateral register facilitating protection of Geographical Indications outside their country of origin. On the bilateral level, the EU objectives are the coverage of all agricultural sectors and the protection at a high level of a maximum number of Geographical Indications. Such objectives are an integral part of the EU's negotiations of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with third countries or regions, or in the absence of comprehensive FTAs, of some stand alone agreements. This approach reflects the importance of an adequate protection of intellectual property rights also in the agricultural sector.
