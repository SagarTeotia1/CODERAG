Question for written answer E-003230/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (7 April 2011) Subject: Fears of record high oil prices Oil prices are rising as military operations in Libya and the spread of unrest to other Middle Eastern countries (Yemen, Syria) are stoking fears about potential risks to oil supplies from the region. In the wake of the recent military operations, oil prices have started going up, having risen by USD 4 in New York to USD 102.99 a barrel and to USD 114 in London. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. What measures will it take, either alone or in cooperation with the U.S. or OPEC, to tackle the problem of rising oil prices? 2. Has it drawn up an action plan in case problems arise in the supply of oil and gas from the region?
