Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2007) The number of farms submitting a single payment scheme (SPS) application in 2005 is as follows: Member State Applications submitted AT 132 244 BE 43 430 DE 386 237 DK 69 474 IE 135 302 IT 662 539 LU 2 006 PT 138 883 SE 84 454 UK 198 078 Total 2005 1 852 647 Final information on the number of farms qualifying for the SPS will only be available late March 2007. However, it is anticipated that the majority of farms having lodged an SPS application will qualify for the SPS. On the basis of Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, OJ L 141, 30.4.2004. , a minimum of 5 % of farmers lodging an SPS claim are to be subject to an on-the-spot check. As a general rule, Article 25(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 stipulates that ‘on-the-spot checks shall be unannounced. However, provided that the purpose of the control is not jeopardised, advance notice may be given, strictly limited to the minimum time period necessary. Such notice shall, except in duly justified cases, not exceed 48 hours’. Statistical information on the number of unannounced on-the-spot checks i.e. breakdown announced and unannounced is not available. The following table indicates the total number of on-the-spot checks i.e. announced and unannounced carried out as communicated to the Commission: Member State Applications submitted Applications checked on the spot Number % AT 132 244 8 131 6.1 % BE 43 430 2 930 6.7 % DE 386 237 21 968 5.7 % DK 69 474 4 150 6.0 % IE 135 302 7 898 5.8 % IT 662 539 38 760 5.9 % LU 2 006 130 6.5 % PT 138 883 7 864 5.7 % SE 84 454 5 247 6.2 % UK 198 078 9 494 4.8 % Total 2005 1 852 647 106 572 5.8 % It should be noted that the figure for the United Kingdom (UK) does not contain the remote sensing controls carried out in Wales. Furthermore, some data may be inconsistent and are under verification in the framework of the clearance of accounts procedure.
