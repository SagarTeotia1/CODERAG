Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (24 October 2008) The Commission follows the evolution of the energy markets very closely and has an ongoing energy dialogue with Russia. However, with respect to the Honourable Member's specific question relating to the activities of consultants and lobbyists in the employ of Gazprom, this matter does not fall within the realm of the Commission's competences insofar as that lobbying activity is not exercised in contacts with the Commission. Should that be the case, the Commission would apply the same rules as to other lobbyists as outlined in its communication on the European Transparency Initiative COM(2008)323 final. .
