Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (5 January 2012) The EU has repeatedly confirmed its readiness to support Tunisia during its process of democratic transition. To this end, in the run up to the Constituent Assembly elections, it provided, inter alia , electoral assistance as well as support to civil society. It also deployed an EU Election Observation Mission during the elections themselves. In total, EUR 9.7 million has been committed for actions to support civil society, non-state actors and the preparation and observation of elections. The EU welcomed the successful conduct of the Constituent Assembly elections. It is ready to work with the new authorities and with civil society to ensure that Tunisia builds on the successes of the transition to date. At the same time, at the end of September 2011 at the first meeting of the EU‑Tunisia Task Force, the EU announced a range of measures in support of reform in Tunisia (for the period 2011 to 2013, the EU has raised the amount indicatively earmarked for Tunisia from EUR 240 million to EUR 400 million) as well as the launch of negotiations on a Privileged Partnership between the EU and Tunisia. The EU will continue to accompany Tunisia during the process of transition. It believes that the best guarantee of a democratic future for Tunisia lies with the Tunisian people through future parliamentary elections, through the development of an open and transparent civil society and through support for the country’s future economic and social development.
