Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (23 November 2010) The Honorable Member mentions that according to a report of 8 September 2010 by Telepolis, information concerning the Indect Project is only allowed to reach the public in filtered form. This new information strategy has apparently been chosen as they are engaged in explaining what the project ‘is not about’ and feel ‘misunderstood’ by reporters and data protectionists. 1. The Commission can not confirm this assumption. No new information policy has been applied to the INDECT project. All relevant information of the INDECT project have been, are and will continue to be made publicly available on the project's website www.indect-project.eu . 2, 3. The Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its answer on the first question. 4. The Commission certainly agrees that transparency is a prerequisite for avoiding misunderstandings. It is for exactly this reason that all relevant documents of the INDECT project are publicly available on the project's website ( 1 ). In order to make project information more user friendly and more complete, INDECT has just revamped and updated its website. 5, 6. The Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to the previous questions on INDECT: E‑1385/10 , E‑1332/10 , E‑2186/10 , E‑3190/10 , E‑3191/10 and E‑1004/10 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . 7. The Commission is holding a wide array of events on the societal dimension of security research, be it through workshops, conferences, publications, information days or by its communication with the European Parliament. For instance, the proceedings of a recent workshop on ‘Societal Security R & D’, held in Brussels on 1 July 2010, can be found on the Europa website http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newsroom/cf/menu.cfm .
