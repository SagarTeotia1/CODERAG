WRITTEN QUESTION E-3320/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (28 June 2007) Subject: EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) The International Trade Committee, in its opinion to the Industry, Research and Energy Committee on a roadmap for renewable energy in Europe, (2007/2090(INI)), ‘calls on the Commission to explore linking the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) with other international schemes in order to create a carbon price signal, incorporating social costs, and to use carbon finance to accelerate action in developing countries’ and ‘stresses that the inclusion of the social costs of carbon emissions within market prices will support the financing of some low carbon technologies by helping to make them more competitive, relative to less environmentally sound technologies’. Is the Commission prepared to explore linking the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) with other international schemes in order to create a carbon price signal? What steps has the Commission taken to this end? Does the Commission consider that the social costs of carbon emissions within market prices will support the financing of some low carbon technologies, helping to make them more competitive?
