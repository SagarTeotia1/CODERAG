been given sufficient attention, at a time when, in the wake of the BSE panic and the reports on dioxin in fisheries products, consumers are now certainly more inclined to opt for environment-friendly products, thus encouraging producers in this direction, given the higher value added now involved. Also relevant here is the promotion and development of methods aimed at yielding products of certifiable quality and at ensuring the traceability of fisheries products, notably in the context of aquaculture. Finally, as far as the international context is concerned the Community must play a leading part in the establishment of transnational arrangements for resource management, since this objective can no longer be postponed. 13 September 2001 OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ENVIRONMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH AND CONSUMER POLICY for the Committee on Fisheries on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on elements of a strategy for the integration of environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy ( COM(2001) 143 – C5‑0343/2001 – 2001/2143(COS)) Draftsman: Laura González Álvarez PROCEDURE The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy appointed Laura González Álvarez draftsman at its meeting of 26 June 2001.

SHORT JUSTIFICATION This communication on the need to integrate environment policy has been published as part of the review of the common fisheries policy (CFP). Integration has been discussed at a whole series of Council meetings, in Cardiff (1998), in Cologne and Helsinki (1999) and in Feira (2000), and finally produced a result in Göteborg (Spring 2001) as part of an overall approach based on sustainable development in which synergy is to be sought between economic, social and environmental policies. In its preparations for the Göteborg Council, Parliament had also expressed the view that the Cardiff process is a fundamental part of the strategy for sustainable development and that this strategy should become the motor for future actions aimed at integrating the environmental dimension. Let us briefly recall some of the Göteborg Council conclusions on managing natural resources more responsibly: - 'the review of the common fisheries policy in 2002 should, based on a broad political debate, address the overall fishing pressure by adapting the EU fishing effort to the level of available resources, taking into account the
