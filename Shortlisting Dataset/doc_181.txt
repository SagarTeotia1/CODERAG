2002/C 205 E/044 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3544/01 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Council (8 January 2002) Subject: List of Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia I have received, from internal sources in the Somali autonomous regions of Puntland, a list of names of people thought to be members of the Al-Ittihad and Al-Islah fundamentalist organisations, which the US and other Western governments consider as terrorist organisations. It is reasonable to deduce from this list that there is a connection with the Somali Transitional National Government (TNG). This document and the freezing of bank accounts of the Al-Baraakat Somali economic and financial network clearly demonstrate the need to shed light on the situation in Somalia and any links there may be between the Transitional National Government and the most extreme Islamic groups in Somalia. Although there has been no reaction yet at institutional level, the reports published in the international press confirm the seriousness and accuracy of the allegations made. Given that the media worldwide claim that Somalia could be one of the next targets of the anti-terrorist campaign, will the Council specify: — whether it is in a position, through the Member States' secret services, to check the accuracy of the claims made in the document and to reply to my question and to those of the general public as a matter of urgency? — whether it is already aware of this situation and, if so, what measures it has taken? — whether the governments engaged in the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan have assessed the dangerous nature of the situation in Somalia? — whether it is considering the possibility of providing support for the Somali movements opposed to the present government, who for a long time have been active in fighting terrorism in their country and in seeking to set up a government of national unity with a view to establishing a federal state?
