2002/C 205 E/043 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3543/01 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (8 January 2002) Subject: Privacy and electronic mail Users of computer services are being offered an increasing number of on-line opportunities. One of the latest, offered by a company specialising in the registration of domain names, consists in providing a personalised electronic mailbox for anyone registering a domain with a given name (namely, www.forename.surname). Without wishing to criticise the imagination which goes into devising more and more opportunities for gifts, I have doubts about the legality of registering a name on the internet, unbeknown to the person concerned, and with anyone being able to gain access to that person's mailbox. Will the Commission therefore state: 1. whether, in its view, such offers constitute an infringement of the right to privacy? 2. whether there are rules which apply to the electronic mail sector? 3. if not, what it intends to do in order to protect the right to privacy in this specific area?
