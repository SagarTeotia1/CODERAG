WRITTEN QUESTION E-1869/04 by Baroness Sarah Ludford (ALDE) to the Commission (2 September 2004) Subject: Cost of free movement Increasing numbers of EU citizens are living in another EU Member State, either taking advantage of their free movement rights in their own right or as the partner of someone who has. They often find that public bodies demand translations of key identity documents, such as passports or birth certificates, in order for them to receive some form of registration or authorisation (e.g. a social security number or a driving licence). What steps is the Commission taking to facilitate ease of recognition of ‘foreign’ EU documents with a view to reducing the cost of translation and to determine who (provider or citizen) bears the cost?
