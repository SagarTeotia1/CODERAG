2004/C 51 E/174 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1904/03 by Alexandros Alavanos (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (2 June 2003) Subject: Increase in Greek public debt According to official figures the Greek public debt rose by EUR 7,3 billion to EUR 173,1 billion in the first quarter of 2003, already exceeding the ceiling figure of EUR 171,05 billion for the end of 2003. Can the Commission explain the reasons for this sharp increase in the Greek Government's debt? Was it caused by state guarantees to various organisations (which organisations and how much) or by fresh loans? What measures are being envisaged by the Commission in cooperation with the Greek Government?
