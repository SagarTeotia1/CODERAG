affordable, in the form of generic drugs, long-term treatment requires lengthy and intensive medical follow-up which health structures in developing countries are incapable of providing; whereas resistance to available drugs increases in such conditions, since they are not used correctly; whereas new impetus should therefore be given to research into new forms of tri- and quadri-therapies and new molecules for treatment and prevention, M. whereas malaria chiefly affects the less-favoured populations of the South, living in tropical and humid zones, and as a result the prevention and treatment of this disease have not been the subject of intensive research by pharmaceutical laboratories; whereas the zone susceptible to the disease is tending to spread northwards with more intensive migration and climate change; whereas affordable drugs are becoming more and more ineffective as organisms are becoming increasingly resistant, whilst the most recent drugs remain too expensive and, as a result, research geared to effective prevention (in particular, by testing new vaccines) and new forms of treatment needs to be stepped up and, at the same time, the cost of new anti-malaria drugs needs to be reduced, N. whereas AIDS currently represents the main problem, since there is no preventive treatment and drugs are too expensive for the majority of populations in the developing countries owing to their price; whereas the first priority is therefore to allow access to these drugs by reducing their cost, without forgetting however that prevention, medical follow-up and research are also vital, O. whereas prevention of HIV/AIDS concerns not only issues linked to the situation as regards health policy or general living conditions but, in particular, social, cultural and religious issues, cultural practices and specifically the relationship between the sexes, P. noting that women are particularly affected by communicable diseases in terms both of infection and of the subsequent economic burden and underlining the importance of involving women in health programmes because of their specific role in basic health care and health education; whereas women should be consulted to ensure that they are fully integrated in the planning and implementation of health programmes, Q. whereas medical screening, diagnosis, the administration of treatment and follow-up of diseases require an adequate health structure and, consequently, diseases can be treated only if health structures (medical centres, specific equipment, qualified staff, etc.) are appropriate, R. whereas the effective prevention and treatment of communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB, must be regarded as indispensable for the world community - and thus considered a 'global public good'. Achieving and safeguarding this global public good cannot be left to market forces alone, but necessitates cooperation with the public sector as well as with civil society, on a national as well as global level, 1. Welcomes the Commission's innovative and comprehensive policy framework and the EU Programme for Action on accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis as they constitute coherent initiatives that extend beyond traditional strategies in addressing health and development in the context of poverty reduction in the developing countries; calls on the Commission to put in place a mechanism to ensure effective coordination
