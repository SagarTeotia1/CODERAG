Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (3 October 2006) The Honourable Member refers to the large presence of goats that are causing the deterioration of vegetation in the site of Community importance ‘Puig d'Alradó — Puig de s'Alcadena’, which was proposed by the Spanish authorities pursuant to Council Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. of 21 May 1992 on the protection of natural habitats and fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive). The Commission is not aware of the situation described. However, it should be noted that the management of sites is the responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member States, who are legally obliged, following the provisions of Article 6(2) of the Habitats Directive, to take the appropriate steps to avoid the deterioration of natural habitats. The Commission does not interfere in the management model developed by Member State authorities. The Commission has not been informed of any measure undertaken in this particular site for managing the population of goats.
