Answer given by Mrs Grybauskaite on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2004) The Court of Auditors is the external auditor of the Commission. It does not investigate cases of corruption and fraud nor does it present estimates for any amounts lost to the Commission due to such cases. The Commission itself has presented since 1990 an annual report on the protection of the communities’ financial interests against fraud to the Parliament and the Council. The figures presented in these reports refer to fraud and irregularities based on communications received from the Member States and cases investigated by the European Anti‑Fraud Office (OLAF) See also the figures published in the activity reports of OLAF on http://europa.eu.int/comm/anti_fraud/reports/index_en.html#olaf (since 1999) and can be consulted on http://europa.eu.int/comm/anti_fraud/reports/index_en.html#ec. The Commission would also refer to the complementary evaluation of the activities of OLAF SEC(2004)1370. which was sent to Parliament and the Council on 28 October 2004 and which contains a chapter on the financial impact of the operational activity of OLAF on the Community budget (Annex 2).
