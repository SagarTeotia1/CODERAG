strengthening labour inspection bodies and other enforcement and professional agencies, where appropriate; also calls on Member States to ensure adequate training for health and safety specialists necessary to prevent known as well as potentially harmful exposures to nanomaterials; 10. Draws attention to the need for prevention and risk reduction measures to be undertaken even when the dangers of particular substances used are still unknown; invites the Bilbao Agency Risk Observatory and the Member States to step up their efforts in awareness-raising and the exchange of good practice; 11. Invites the Commission, in the context of the implementation of Directive 89/391/EEC, to consider the need for an adequate instrument to deal with the exposure of nanoparticles in the workplace as soon as further research on the ‘knowledge gaps’, in particular with regard to hazards and exposure risks, are resolved, allowing a comprehensive understanding of the properties and risks of those materials; 12. Considers that the placing of such substances on the market has to take into account the free movement of products, which can lead to secondary and end-use being in another country; considers therefore that requirements regarding customer information and the labelling of products have to be clarified, and urges the Member States to ensure compliance with existing provisions on labelling and information in relation to nanomaterials, in the necessary languages, so as to ensure that workers are provided with transparent information and that a precautionary approach can be applied; 13. Furthermore points out that, in individual cases, provisions on worker protection and safety concerning nanomaterials should be available in several languages; 14. Emphasises that a clear assignment of liability to producers and employers arising from nanotechnology and from the use of nanomaterials is necessary; 15. Underlines the need for rapid improvement of the scientific knowledge and its uptake, in particular the research underpinning risk assessment and measurement, effective risk prevention and protection measures, in accordance with existing Community occupational health and safety legislation; considers it of the utmost importance that possible health and safety at work implications are addressed at the same time as research into new applications is being undertaken; moreover considers it vital that a substantial part of the RTD budgets for nanotechnologies is earmarked to occupational health and safety, consumer protection and environmental considerations; 16. Calls on the Commission and Member States to pay special attention to the social dimension of the development of nanotechnology, including to the accompanying social-science research; underlines the fact that nanotechnology should be judged in terms of its usefulness and its effect on humans and the environment; furthermore considers that the active participation of the social partners concerned has to be ensured from the earliest possible stage.
