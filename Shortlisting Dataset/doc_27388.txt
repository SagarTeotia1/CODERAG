WRITTEN QUESTION E-3610/04 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (11 January 2005) Subject: Technical standards for heavy goods vehicles In November 2003, the daughter of one of my constituents was killed when the vehicle in which she was travelling was hit by a wheel that had been shed by a heavy goods vehicle travelling on the other side of the motorway. Had the HGV in question been fitted with plastic indicators which can help identify wheel-nut looseness, the accident might not have occurred. UK police forces report that, during a sample period, February-April 1997, they investigated 92 incidents involving total detachment of wheels. Will the Commission consider recommending the fitting of wheel-nut looseness indicators to HGVs or propose making such devices mandatory in future legislation?
