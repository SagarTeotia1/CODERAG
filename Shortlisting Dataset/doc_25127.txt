ORAL QUESTION H-0099/04 for Question Time at the part-session in March I 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Juan Ferrández Lezaun to the Commission Subject: Overall assessment of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan and the Ebro delta The Spanish Government has submitted its application for Community funding for the Ebro diversion project as part of the Spanish Hydrological Plan. The Commission has indicated that an overall assessment of the project will be carried out towards the middle of this year. It has also acknowledged the importance of an integrated plan for the Ebro delta (PIDE) being drawn up prior to implementation of the transfer project to evaluate and take account of the project's repercussions on the ecosystem of the delta, and thereby prevent any deterioration in line with the requirements laid down by the Water Framework Directive. Can the Commission say when it expects to receive the integrated plan for the Ebro delta approved by the Spanish Government? Will the Commission carry out the overall assessment of the project without this integrated plan?
