WRITTEN QUESTION P-3604/07 by Johannes Blokland (IND/DEM) to the Commission (10 July 2007) Subject: EU communications policy Since 29 June 2007 the Commission has been using EUTube to distribute its audiovisual communications material. Forty-six films are currently available. One of them, entitled Film lovers will love this! (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koRlFnBlDH0), is intended to show EU support for the European film industry. 1. Why has the Commission chosen only this content to illustrate EU support for the European film industry? 2. The EU claims to be not only an economic community but a community of values. In the Commission’s view, what European values does this film promote? 3. Does the Commission think that this film informs the public of the EU’s priorities and will increase public involvement in the EU? 4. Is the Commission aware that this film may strengthen the view that the EU is getting involved in areas where it should not be getting involved? 5. In its review of the audiovisual services directive the European Parliament stressed the need to protect underage children with regard to explicitly sexual audiovisual productions on television and on the Internet. Does the Commission support this opinion? If so, how does this film relate to this view? 6. Is the Commission aware that a large number of EU citizens regard such an EU communication as offensive? Is the Commission prepared to take account of this view in its future communications? 7. On the basis of the considerations set out above, is the Commission prepared to remove this film from EUTube?
