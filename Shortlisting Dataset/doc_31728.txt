Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2012) Since the beginning of the unrest and even before, the High Representative/Vice-President has made her views on events in Yemen known through a series of public statements (19 in total). All can be found on the website of the European External Action Service http://eeas.europa.eu/ . In addition, the EU’s position has been expressed in six sets of Foreign Affairs Council conclusions, most recently in December 2011. Beyond this, the HR/VP has conveyed her position directly both in a conversation with President Saleh in spring and in her two meetings with Foreign Minister Al Qirbi. In addition, the EU’s views and positions are expressed to the Yemeni authorities by the EU Delegation in Sana’a, which has remained open throughout the unrest and which continues to be actively and closely involved in the efforts to ensure a peaceful transfer of power in Yemen. In so doing, it is in close contact with all different parties in Yemen, as well as with the leading international and regional actors. The HR/VP continues to closely monitor the situation with as the overarching concern the wellbeing of the Yemeni population.
