occasion a WFP-contracted truck loaded with WFP food was attacked by armed bandits, F. whereas increasing incidence of banditry in Eastern Chad is forcing humanitarian agencies to reduce staff and movements in key towns, further restricting their ability to provide much needed humanitarian assistance, G. whereas on 15 October 2007 the Council adopted a joint action on the operation EUFOR CHAD/CAR designed to contribute to protecting civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel by helping to improve security in the area of operations and to contribute to protecting UN personnel, facilities, installations and equipment and to ensuring the security and freedom of movement of its staff and UN associated personnel, H. whereas the deployment of EUFOR CHAD/CAR troops is being delayed due to lack of ground and air transport equipment, I. whereas any domestic instability in Chad - together with the insecurity of the border region of eastern Chad, Darfur and the Central African Republic - will also have a negative effect and impact on the EUFOR CHAD/CAR operation once it is deployed, J. whereas international concerns over the conflict have heightened since the UFDD threatened to attack the French or any other foreign force deployed in the EUFOR CHAD/CAR mission, K. whereas grave conflict-related violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law continue in eastern Chad; whereas women and girls in the region are particularly vulnerable to such abuses, continuing facing rape and other sexual violence at the hands of armed groups, 1. Calls for the immediate deployment of the EUFOR CHAD/CAR in the areas of recent violence and unrest in Chad; underlines that the countries of the EU and the UN have a responsibility to protect civilians, refugees and internally displaced persons in this region; stresses that these forces must have and use all means necessary, and in full compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law, to protect civilians at risk; 2. Regrets that the EUFOR CHAD/CAR mission still lacks vital equipment to enable troops to carry out their duties, such as helicopters and medical supplies; calls therefore on the EU and its Member States to take urgent steps to honour the political decision made and to provide this mission with more troops and appropriate financial, logistical and air support; underscores that the credibility of the European Security and Defence Policy is at stake if it cannot mobilise sufficient troops and equipment to make this mission operational; 3. Underlines the importance of guaranteeing the diversity of the composition of EUFOR CHAD/CAR, in order to make sure it is perceived as being neutral by local actors; 4. Stresses that the international community and all parties to the present conflict have a responsibility to protect civilians, to allow delivery of aid and to respect humanitarian space and the safety of humanitarian workers; demands therefore that conditions be immediately created for adequate response to the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in eastern Chad; calls on the Chadian authorities to fully cooperate with EUFOR CHAD/CAR
