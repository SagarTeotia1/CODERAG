Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (31 August 2011) The EU is aware of the recent ordinations of prelates to which the Honourable Member refers. At the EU‑China human rights dialogue on 16 June 2011, the EU raised the issue of freedom of religion concerning Christians, and urged China to relax its policy of close supervision of religious organisations. The Chinese authorities indicated in response that all churches needed to be registered in order to enjoy lawful rights. The EU has not considered suspending economic agreements concluded with the People’s Republic of China in response to violations of freedom of religion.
