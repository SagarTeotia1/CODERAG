to avoid any measures which work against reinforced cooperation such as those on foreign repair stations, anti-trust exemptions and air carrier citizenship mentioned in House Resolution 915; Transatlantic Economic Council Meeting and the reinforcement of the TEC 20. Underlines that a closer transatlantic partnership with a view to the completion of a transatlantic market by 2015, based on the principle of a social market economy, is a vital instrument for shaping globalisation and for dealing with global economic and social crises; 21. Requests the Commission to set out a detailed road map of existing obstacles to the attainment of that target; recalls the study which the European Parliament authorised and financed in its 2007 budget; wonders why neither of these documents has so far been released by the Commission despite repeated requests by the European Parliament to do so; sets 15 November 2009 as the final date for their publication; 22. Considers that transatlantic cooperation on energy efficiency and technology (including 'green energy') and on energy regulatory areas can be dealt with within the TEC; insists that transatlantic cooperation on energy security should constitute one of the central issues to be addressed regularly within the Transatlantic Political Council (TPC), whose creation was proposed by the European Parliament in its Resolution of 26 March 2009; 23. Believes that transatlantic economic cooperation must be made more accountable, transparent and predictable and that schedules of meetings, agendas, road-maps and progress reports should be regularly published and immediately posted on a website; proposes to hold a annual debate on the progress made on issues discussed within the TEC, as well as its structure; The role of the TLD in the TEC 24. Reiterates its call upon the leadership of the EU and the US, as well as the co-chairs of the TEC, to take account of the crucial role of legislators for the success of the TEC; urges them to involve the representatives of the TLD fully and directly in the TEC, as legislators share with their respective executive branches responsibility for the enactment and oversight of many of the TEC decisions; 25. Believes that it is essential to ensure that the most appropriate members of Congress and the European Parliament are brought into the Legislators' Dialogue and the TEC process, in order to prevent legislation with an unintended impact on transatlantic trade and investment; hopes that the new agreement could upgrade the current TLD into a transatlantic inter-parliamentary assembly, following recommendations made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 26 March 2009; TEC and the economic and financial crises 26. Underlines the role of the TEC in promoting and ensuring a coordinated US-EU regulatory response to the crises, in particular regarding alternative investment funds, financial market infrastructure (especially regarding Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives markets), capital requirements, tax havens and cross-border insolvency resolution; calls on the TEC to examine the coordination of the remuneration policies of financial institutions; 27.
