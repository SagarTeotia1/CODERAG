within those countries, notably where income gaps within and among countries remain wide and there is an increasing number of people living in poverty, B. whereas no country has developed successfully by turning its back on international trade and long-term capital flows, but whereas it is equally true that no country has developed simply by opening itself up to foreign trade and investment without protecting the vulnerable sectors of its economy; whereas the successful cases have combined the opportunities offered by world markets with a domestic investment and institution-building strategy which stimulates the spirits of domestic entrepreneurs, C. bearing in mind that the key to successful development models, East-Asian in particular, is a coherent strategy of raising the opportunities for private investment through a range of policies that included credit subsidies, credit to large business groups at negative real interest rates, and tax incentives, educational policies, establishment of public enterprises, export inducements, duty-free access to inputs and capital goods, and actual government coordination of investment plans, D. stressing that today's rich countries had once embarked on economic growth behind protective barriers, that only once their capacity and infrastructure had been developed had they introduced low trade barriers, and that the absence of a robust positive relationship between open trade policies and economic growth may come as a surprise in view of the widespread claim that trade liberalisation promotes higher growth, E. noting that market economies rely on a wide array of non-market institutions with regulatory, stabilising and legitimising functions, and that the quality of a country's public institutions, measures to combat corruption and better regulation are all critically determinant of a country's long-term development, F. whereas the WTO Doha Development Agenda Trust Fund is a central instrument designed to fund trade-related technical assistance and capacity-building to help countries to participate in trade negotiations in the WTO, implement their outcomes and realise their wealth-creating potential for the benefit of their populations; whereas the EU and the Member States have pledged contributions to this Fund of about EUR 14 million which amounts to 63 % of the total contributions to the Fund for 2002, G. whereas it is essential that Community agricultural, commercial and development cooperation policies should be coherent if any one of these policies is to prove effective, and whereas that process must be guided by the ultimate objectives of food security and the eradication of poverty, H. whereas the Commission has presented a request for the Council to authorise it to negotiate economic partnership agreements with ACP countries and regions; whereas such recommendation for a Council Decision will be the subject of a resolution and a report of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I. whereas the illegal global trade in natural resources such as diamonds, vanadium, cobalt, titanium, gas, oil, timber and gold in many cases fuels corruption, undermines the rule of law, encourages unsustainable environmental exploitation, prolongs conflict and deprives citizens of much needed funds for development, J. whereas illegal trading prolongs and sustains conflicts; regrets that the products involved in this illegal trade have as their ultimate end
