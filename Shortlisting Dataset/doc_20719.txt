Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2011) Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the major global currencies have been subject to significant volatility. From the start of 2011 to 25 July 2011, the euro appreciated by some 7.6 % against the US dollar. However, the appreciation in real effective terms (i.e. against all main trading partners, trade weighted and adjusted for inflation differentials) has been more muted (about 3.2 %). A strong currency does not represent a problem per se, as long as it is not overvalued with respect to economic fundamentals. Indeed, the nominal appreciation of the euro against the US dollar in the first half of 2011 served to mitigate ‘imported inflation’ (due to higher energy and commodity prices), permitting euro area consumers to lose less purchasing power than a weaker euro would imply. In real effective terms, the exchange rate level of the euro remains in fact close to its long-term average. Neither does the effective euro exchange rate deviate much from model-based calculations at equilibrium exchange rates. Going forward from a global perspective, it will be important that countries avoid artificially undervalued exchange rates and ensure progress towards more market-determined exchange rate systems, enhancing exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying economic fundamentals and refraining from competitive devaluation, as agreed in the G20 Seoul Summit held in November 2010.
