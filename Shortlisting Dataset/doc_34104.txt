Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (2 October 2007) Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the Single European Sky (SES) O L 96, 31.3.2004. , requires each Member State to establish a National Supervisory Authority (Article 4). Such a supervisory body is required to be independent from the air navigation service providers through adequate ‘separation’ (Article 4 paragraph 2). As stated by the Honourable Member, in the opinion of the Commission, Greece has not satisfied the requirements of the SES legislation and infringement proceedings have been brought against it. Concerning the specific questions: 1. The Commission has been informed that the process for the establishment of the Greek National Supervisory Authority is ongoing. To date, the Commission understands that the process is still awaiting governmental approval and consequently neither notification of the creation of the National Supervisory Authority nor of the certification of the air traffic service providers by the Authority have been received. 2. Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 of Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the provision of air navigation services in the Single European Sky (the Service Provision Regulation) (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 96, 31.3.2004. requires all air navigation service providers to be certified by their National Supervisory Authority by 20 December 2006, with the possibility of a six month derogation to 20 June 2007. Without certification, the service provider would no longer legally be able to provide its services. 3. Under the SES legislation, the responsibility for ensuring a safe system lies with the air navigation service provider and the role of the National Supervisory Authority is to ensure proper compliance. As the Greek Civil Aviation Authority continues to take responsibility for the safety oversight for the air traffic service provision over their territory, consequently, in the short term, the lack of certification is not expected to have a significant effect on safety. However, in the longer term, non-compliance with the Community safety requirements and the non-participation of the Greek National Supervisory Authority in the ‘peer review process’ (Commission Regulation (EC) No 2096/2005 Article 9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2096/2005 of 20 December 2005 laying down common requirements for the provision of air navigation services (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 335, 21.12.2005. could have safety implications. Similarly, the responsibility for taking the measures required under the Interoperability Regulation Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 of Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management network (the interoperability Regulation) (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 96, 31.3.2004. rests with the service provider, with the role of the Authority being to provide oversight and ensure compliance. Whilst the initial impact is likely to be minor, it could increasingly become a problem with time.
