Question for written answer E-012113/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Zigmantas Balčytis (S&D) (3 January 2012) Subject: Introduction of alien species by ships The Baltic Sea is currently one of the most sensitive seas in the world with intensive shipping activity. At any given moment, more than 2 000 ships are operating in the Baltic. Maritime transport is extremely important for the entire Baltic Sea Region. The increased use of the Baltic Sea by shipping and the resulting rise in the number of invasive species pose a threat to the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea. Most harmful and contagious waterborne organisms enter the marine environment via ships. The organisms that have been transported to the Baltic Sea in ballast water and ballast sediments can further upset the balance of the endangered natural ecosystems. One of the key projects under Pillar 1 of the Baltic Sea Strategy deals with ‘restricting the introduction of new species by ships’. Can the Commission state what has been done to date to prevent harmful and contagious waterborne organisms entering the marine environment in the ballast water of ships? What progress has been made in the ports on installing ballast water reception facilities? Has a monitoring system been introduced which could help solve the problem of the dissemination of invasive species? Which countries are involved in the implementation of this project? How much funding will be required and how much funding is available for the implementation of this project?
