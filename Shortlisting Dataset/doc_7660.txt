of competitiveness strategies in the industrial and service sectors and promote good practice as regards the entrepreneurial environment and entrepreneurship, including corporate social responsibility and equal opportunities for men and women; 16. Recognises that technological capacity and business innovation need to be boosted as a matter of urgency and, to that end, schemes devised to provide direct support for research activities carried out in consortia, involving companies and research units or university teams, thus enabling skills and technologies to be transferred more rapidly; 17. Stresses the importance of cooperation between the Member States with a view to increasing investment in R&D; recalls that the objectives of the Lisbon strategy are minimum objectives which the Member States should commit themselves to upholding; 18. Calls for greater attention to focus on industrial change and restructuring, and notes with satisfaction the creation of a fund intended to form part of a global policy of assistance with managing such change; 19. Points to the need to monitor company relocations in the EU Member States and maintains that policy as regards granting Community funds needs to be changed with a view to safeguarding employment and regional development, but recognises that undertakings and workers will have to constantly adapt in order to create growth and employment; refers to the “flexicurity” model, with a high level of flexibility among workers and a high level of social security, supported by an active labour market policy. Calls for better checks and better traceability of the utilisation of European funds so as to ensure they are used for their proper purpose and not to finance relocation either within or outside the European Union; 20. Calls for the rights of workers to be protected when manufacturing companies are restructured and hence for the availability of information to be fully guaranteed, for workers’ representative bodies, especially European Works Councils, to wield decisive influence throughout the process, including the right of veto, and for criteria to be laid down to determine what compensation should be paid to workers if a company fails to honour its commitments; 21. Maintains that no Community aid should be granted to companies which, after receiving such support in a Member State, transfer their manufacturing operations to another country without completely fulfilling the agreements entered into with the Member State concerned.
