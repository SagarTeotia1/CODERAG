before 15 January 2002. The agreement with Guinea-Bissau is one of the oldest the EU has concluded with a third country with the first protocol dating back to 1980. If accepted, the new protocol would be the ninth one in a row. The implementation of the previous protocol, which expired on 15 June 2001, was characterised by the suspension of fishing activities between June 1998 and April 1999 due to the outbreak of an armed conflict in Guinea-Bissau that did not allow for the safe carrying out of fishing activities by EU vessels. In its report on the issue the European Parliament backed the Council's proposal to suspend the fishing agreement ( A4-0178/99 , draftsman José Girao Pereira). When peace returned the EU decided to allocate this amount to Guinea-Bissau for the restoration of facilities supporting the fishing sector in the country. Parliament again endorsed this approach ( A5-0367/2000 , draftsman Arlindo Cunha), allowing Guinea-Bissau to use 6 500 000 €, a sum equivalent to the unpaid part of the financial compensation, exclusively for support for local fisheries activities. Content of the proposal The table below shows the key figures of the Commission's proposal compared to the previous two protocols (protocol 7 and 8).
