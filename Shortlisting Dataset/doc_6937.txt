WRITTEN QUESTION E-3083/07 by Vural Öger (PSE) to the Commission (20 June 2007) Subject: Moroccan plan for autonomy for the Sahara region On 11 April 2007, Morocco submitted its plan for autonomy for the Sahara region to the UN Secretary-General. In its resolution of 30 April 2007 (S/RES/1754), the Security Council welcomed the ‘serious and credible Moroccan efforts to move the process forward towards resolution’. From my own point of view — and that of the international community, in particular Great Britain, the US, France and Spain — this plan seems to form a really good basis for negotiations with a view to resolving the 32‑year‑old conflict. Furthermore, the document is a unique example of a centralised state starting a process of democratic decentralisation by granting extensive autonomy. What is the Commission’s opinion of this initiative by Morocco, and what steps does it intend to take to ensure that this new opportunity to resolve the conflict is successful?
