Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (5 February 2007) The Honourable Member’s question refers, on the one hand, to Iberdrola’s possible takeover of Scottish Power and, on the other hand, to possible state aid provided to Iberdrola in the form of goodwill write-offs. The Honourable Member asks what role the Commission is playing in this takeover. He also asks whether the Commission will be taking steps to ensure that any possible takeover is delayed until the related tax investigation is concluded. As regards the Commission’s role in this takeover, and further to the notification of concentration provided as a consequence of the operation’s Community dimension under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings OJ L 24, 29.1.2004. , the Commission should give its opinion by 16 February 2007, in accordance with Article 10 of the same regulation. As regards the takeover itself, it will not be delayed until the investigation into possible state aid is concluded. Although the Commission is bound to take state aid into account in its concentration decisions, the strict timeframe of these procedures does not allow for the type of suspension suggested by the Honourable Member. It is true that the Commission must avoid inconsistencies in the way different Community provisions are implemented See the judgments of the Court of Justice of 15 June 1993 in Case C‑225/91 Matra v Commission [1993] ECR I‑3203, paragraph 41, and of 27 January 2000 in Case C‑164/98 P DIR International Film and others v Commission , [2000] ECR I‑447, paragraphs 21 and 30. . This obligation is particularly relevant in cases where the provisions in question share the objective of undistorted competition in the common market See paragraph 42 of the abovementioned judgment in Matra v Commission , and the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 18 September 1995 in Case T-49/93 SIDE v Commission [1995] ECR II‑2501, paragraph 72. . Preventive monitoring of concentrations and state aid monitoring nevertheless remain independent procedures See paragraphs 114 and 115 of the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 31 January 2001 in Case T‑156/98 RJB Mining v Commission [2001] ECR II‑337. . In this case, the Commission has yet to give its opinion on the compatibility, from a state aid point of view, of the Spanish goodwill write-off provisions; they do not, however, appear to be contrary to the Fourth Accounting Directive. That said, on 22 March 2006 the Commission did ask Spain to remove its existing tax incentives for export scheme (Case E22/2004) http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/state_aid/register/ii/by_range_e2004.html . Spain accepted the appropriate measures proposed by the Commission, thereby terminating the procedure. The Commission had no grounds in this case for requiring received aid to be recovered. Should the Commission investigate Iberdrola’s takeover of Scottish Power for purposes of merger control, it should, in order to assess whether the operation is compatible with the common market, take into account any state aid when determining the financial strength of the merged entity See the abovementioned judgment in RJB Mining v
