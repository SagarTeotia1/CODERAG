WRITTEN QUESTION E-2694/07 by Carmen Fraga Estévez (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (24 May 2007) Subject: ICCAT recommendation on sharks In the management recommendations made in the ICCAT scientific committee's 2006‑07 report with regard to sharks, it is once again stressed that the 5 % fin/body weight ratio for sharks needs to be better defined in line with the type of fins which are to be considered in this ratio, and likewise, the different kinds of processing of fins and bodies according to fleets. The conversion factors need to be adjusted to the different species and/or the various fleets, so that the ICCAT recommendations can be properly complied with. Can the Commission state the reason for not proceeding to a correct evaluation of the 5 % fin/body weight ratio for sharks in order to bring current legislation into line with the real situation regarding species and fishing grounds?
