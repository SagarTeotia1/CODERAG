Question for written answer E-001897/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (16 February 2012) Subject: Nuclear fusion: promotion of FAST within FP8 In the context of EU and international policies, research into nuclear fusion in Italy constitutes an area of excellence. The construction of ITER, the first fusion power station of a size comparable to that of a conventional power station, which began in 2007 at the Cadarache site in France, marks a decisive step towards demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of generating energy using controlled thermonuclear fusion. The scientific proposal relating to the FAST (Fusion Advanced Studies Torus) experiment carried out in Italy will accompany ITER during its operational phase, and FAST is therefore considered to be an ITER satellite. FAST can be regarded as a type of wind tunnel for aerodynamic testing. It will enable the testing of advanced materials, innovative techniques and operating procedures before they are used in ITER, which will be able to meet its objectives more quickly and more safely. Considering that: — FAST will have a significant economic impact on industry and on the development of new technologies, as indicated by a review of the European programme carried out by an international panel in 2008 (and by the Agreement on the Establishment of the ITER International Fusion Energy Organisation); — the activities are carried out within the framework of the EURATOM fusion programme, under Council Directive 2009/71/Euratom of 25 June 2009, can the Commission say how it intends to promote initiatives to integrate and share FAST within the new Framework Programme 2014-2018 (FP8) on the funding of existing experimental facilities or those that are under construction? Can it also say whether it intends to establish guidelines to support nuclear fusion as one of the options for ensuring a large-scale, sustainable, safe and practically inexhaustible source of energy that does not produce harmful or greenhouse gas emissions?
