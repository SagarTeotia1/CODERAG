WRITTEN QUESTION E-1205/05 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (5 April 2005) Subject: Turkish settlers in Cyprus The Government of the Republic of Cyprus alleges that the Government of Turkey is continuing to make concerted efforts to transfer settlers to the northern part of the island and claims (4 February 2005) that ‘latest reports show that, only in the last year, 40000 additional Turkish settlers have been transferred to Cyprus.’ Can the Commission confirm the accuracy of this figure? If it cannot, what is its own estimate of the number of such settlers who have been moved to the island in the last year? If the figures suggested are exaggerated, what representations have been made to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus in order to point out that such propaganda can do little to facilitate efforts to resolve differences between all the parties concerned? If the figures are correct, or even if considerable settlement is continuing to take place, what representations have been made to the Government of Turkey about the situation? What responses to the various representations has the Commission received?
