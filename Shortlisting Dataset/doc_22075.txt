Augustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA (EPP-ED, ES) Report on designation of Europol as the Central Office for combating euro counterfeiting Doc.: A6-0079/2005 Procedure : Consultation Vote : 12.04.2005 Vote Worried by the fact that the euro is plagued by widespread counterfeiting, six Member States launched last year an initiative to designate Europol as the EU's central office to deal with this crime. At present each Member State has its own national office to prevent the production of false euros. In a consultation report adopted by Parliament, MEPs consider that the cooperation of Member States to fight this type of crime should be strengthened and not replaced by Europol. This body should not become the central office to prevent euro counterfeiting alone because its statute has legal and operational restrictions. MEPs agreed that Europol should centralise all the information to investigate and prevent the production of false euros but always " in close cooperation with the national central offices of the Member States " . Two main reasons were raised by the rapporteur Augustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA (EPP-ED, ES): Europol is unable today to forward information directly to Member States (it has to do it through the national liaison office for each MS), something which would slow down the supply of information; and it is unable to forward personal data to a third State unless an agreement to that effect has been concluded beforehand.
