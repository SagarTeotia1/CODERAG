WRITTEN QUESTION E-0404/06 by Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE) to the Commission (7 February 2006) Subject: Anti-dumping investigation into safety footwear The complaint and the notice of initiation regarding this proceeding merely indicates ‘footwear having a protective toecap’ as the product concerned, and lists 49 Combined Nomenclature codes as an indication of what is covered. For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, it is important to focus the proceeding on actual safety and protective footwear as defined by the European Standardisation Committee. Such a definition includes, in particular, clear-cut requirements for the toecaps to be considered to fulfil a protective function. How does the Commission intend to deal with the fact that without reference to any such workable standard definition, the current explanation regarding the product concerned is in fact unclear to the point of being legally invalid?
