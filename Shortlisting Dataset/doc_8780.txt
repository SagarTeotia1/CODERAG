the utmost importance to speeding up the payment of sums due by the Commission, currently subject to frequently unacceptable delays; calls on the Commission to take steps to ensure that the target it has set (payment in 60 days for 95% of invoices by 2002 - see Action 10) can be achieved as quickly as possible; requests also that the creditors concerned should be entitled to interest on late payments and that the audit reports should pay special attention to late payments; welcomes the creation of a register of received invoices in the Commission but regrets that this had not been in existence until now; 11. Calls on the Commission to inform the European Parliament on a regular basis about the progress made regarding payment deadlines; Activity-based management 12. Strongly endorses the introduction of a system of activity-based management, an integral part of which is the inclusion in the planning and programming process for subsequent years of an evaluation of the management systems of the Commission's directorates-general by the new Internal Audit Service; 13. Notes with interest that an annual activity report for each directorate-general (see Action 13) will be published for the first time in January 2001 and expects that this will provide a useful supplement to the information traditionally provided in the revenue and expenditure account and financial statement provided for in Article 275 of the EC Treaty; reiterates its demand that this report should include a detailed financial statement, including a precise payment error rate as well as annual targets for reducing this rate; Externalisation strategy 14. Notes the Commission's argument that it should focus on the responsibilities conferred on it under the provisions of the Treaties; notes the criteria adopted by the Commission to guide decisions on externalising activities; stresses in particular, in view of the cases brought to light during the 1996 discharge, that a preponderant role should be given to criteria such as cost-effectiveness, as well as the Commission's capacity to fulfil its responsibilities for budget implementation and its powers of control over external activities; 15. Takes note of the Commission communication of 26 July 2000 entitled "Matching the Commisison's activities with its human resources - the means to achieve our objectives" ( SEC(2000) 2000 ) the list of activities and tasks for which the Commission is considering whether externalisation would be feasible and appropriate; opposes the externalisation of activities related to checks and monitoring; wishes to reserve its final position on externalisation pending the forthcoming Commission communication which, inter alia, will focus on the regulatory framework for the implementing agencies; Management performance 16. Welcomes the measures designed to improve management standards and develop a culture of accountability, the lack of which was severely criticised by the Committee of Independent Experts: - merit-based appointments to senior management posts (A1 and A2) - a requirement laid down in the Staff Regulations that applies to all posts (see Action 21); - introduction of a probationary period for officials in the abovementioned grades and individual performance appraisal (see Action 22); 17. Calls on the Commission to draw up the
