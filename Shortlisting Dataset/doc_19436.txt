WFD. In 2001, a so called Common Implementation Strategy was initiated by the Commission and Member States' Water Directors. This process brings together Member States, stakeholders and Commission experts on all aspects of the implementation of the directive to support its implementation. To date, 24 Guidance documents have resulted from such process, including ‘Guidance document No 20 : Exemptions to the environmental objectives’ http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/facts_figures/guidance_docs_en.htm .
