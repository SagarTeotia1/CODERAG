WRITTEN QUESTION E-5846/07 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (27 November 2007) Subject: Serious accidents concerning tractor drivers In Cyprus, numerous serious accidents have taken place over the last few years involving overturned tractors. Such accidents have resulted in death or serious injury of the drivers. The Commission's directive, relating to the need to have a protective metallic surround so as to protect the drivers of tractors, appears not to be followed as far as Cyprus farmers are concerned and it appears that such directive is not being implemented by the Cyprus authorities. Is the Commission aware of this state of affairs? Will the Commission advise the Cyprus authorities to proceed urgently with implementation of the said directive so as to prevent further loss of human lives?
