of the driving forces of innovation and constitutes a significant competitive advantage for the Union; stresses that high-quality vocational education and training contribute fundamentally to sustainable development and to the creation of a functioning single market, and should be constantly adapted to the needs and developments in the European labour market through an extensive dialogue among all interested parties; 67. Points out that in the new digital economy, creativity and ICTs are building a new business culture that can facilitate cooperation and exchanges of good practice among Member States with a view to improving the quality of VET, and that it is therefore time to put VET at the centre of the agenda, especially in order to face the challenges posed by the 2020 strategy, such as the EU headline target of 40 % of 30- to 34-year-olds completing tertiary or equivalent education; 68. Calls on the Member States to establish and implement quality assurance systems at national level and develop a competence framework for teachers and trainers; 69. Calls on the Commission to provide information regarding the expected changes on labour markets within the EU, and on the Member States to incorporate this information in their educational strategies and programmes; 70. Calls on the Member States to encourage synergies at local level between the social partners, local professional associations, universities, school management bodies and educational units in order, through scientific studies and systematic consultations, to draw up a medium-term plan for future skill requirements and to calculate the number of pupils needed per area, which would increase the effectiveness of vocational training in effecting a direct and durable transition to the labour market; 71. Encourages the Commission to develop and update regularly a chart giving a region-by-region picture of training qualifications and demand; 72. Notes that vocational education and training are focused on key competences, including entrepreneurship, which must be fostered from the onset of children's education; considers that this process must continue alongside work-based learning; 73. Calls for support at national and European level by creating a common basis of action regarding vocational education and training, with a view to delivering the aims of efficiency, labour mobility and job creation within the European Union; 74. Calls on the Member States to actively involve private higher education institutions, as well as public institutions such as universities, in the upgrading and expansion of vocational skill development, especially for the MINT professions (mathematics, informatics, natural sciences, and technology); 75. Calls for a specific EU initiative to attract girls to the MINT professions and to combat the stereotypes that still dominate these professions; stresses that the media and education play key roles in combating such stereotypes; 76. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the full transposition, implementation and enforcement of EU legislation by supporting training programmes aimed at ensuring that stakeholders acquire an adequate understanding of the legislation in force and of their corresponding rights and responsibilities; 77. Calls on the Member States to support innovative activities and doctoral and post-doctoral programmes that will underpin competitiveness and sustainable economic growth;
