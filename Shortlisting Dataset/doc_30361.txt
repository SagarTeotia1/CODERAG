WRITTEN QUESTION E-3798/08 by Corien Wortmann-Kool (PPE-DE) to the Council (8 July 2008) Subject: Innovation fund for inland navigation In its conclusions of June 2006 the Council called on the Commission to present a proposal for a European innovation fund for inland navigation. The European Parliament subsequently stated in a resolution that this innovation fund should be financed one third by the industry via the reserve fund, one third by the EU and one third by the Member States. The innovation fund is one of the pillars of the Naiades action programme and of great importance as regards encouraging and facilitating development and investment in inland navigation. It was no coincidence that the announcement of the fund was greeted very favourably at the time. This creates obligations. Cooperation with, and involvement of, the Council are essential. Despite all efforts, sadly, there is as yet no innovation fund in existence. 1. Does the Council recognise the importance of a European innovation fund for inland navigation? 2. What reasons does the Council see for the slow progress in setting up a European innovation fund? 3. What measures is the Council taking to facilitate the rapid establishment of a European innovation fund? 4. Is the Council prepared to make efforts to ensure that the innovation fund has been established by the end of the year?
