Question for written answer E-6027/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Syed Kamall (ECR) (26 July 2010) Subject: EU guidelines on fire risk assessments I have been contacted by a constituent who would like to know if there are any EU guidelines on fire risk assessments for council housing in Member States. If so, could the Commission inform me where these guidelines can be found?
