Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (31 May 2007) The Commission decided to send a letter of formal notice, the first step of the pre-litigation procedure under Article 226 of the EC Treaty, to Ireland on 4 April 2006. At that time concerns existed as to the availability of caller location information for emergency calls made from mobile networks using the Single European Emergency Number 112 in Ireland (proceeding number 2006/2113). Following the explanations given by the Irish authorities in their response to the Commission's letter of formal notice and following further scrutiny by the Commission services, the Commission concluded that caller location information for mobile calls is provided on individual request of the emergency authorities (‘pull’ solution), and consequently decided on 12 October 2006 to close the case. The Commission also noted that Ireland announced its intentions to introduce an automatic forwarding of caller location information (‘push’ solution) as recommended by the Commission in its Recommendation 2003/558/EC Commission Recommendation of 25 July 2003 on the processing of caller location information in electronic communication networks for the purpose of location-enhanced emergency call services (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2003) 2657), OJ L 189, 29.07.2003 . in the course of 2007.
