Question for written answer P-8846/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Dimitar Stoyanov (NI) (26 October 2010) Subject: Violation of the customs arrangements for the import of goods into the EU According to the company Cosmos Energy Ltd, vessels are being illegally supplied with fuel, on which no excise duty is being levied, at a mooring station located at km 503 on the River Danube. The bunker fuel is being imported into the EU on Ukrainian vessels owned by the English firm F&M Agency. That fuel is being declared as in transit, and therefore not subject to the payment of customs duties. It is being transferred from a Ukrainian vessel in transit to Romanian tankers moored at km 503 on the Danube, which then supply passing commercial vessels with fuel. This type of refuelling is significantly cheaper, as the fuel is not subject to excise duty, and the passing commercial vessels therefore buy their fuel primarily from the Romanian tankers. The activities carried on by F&M Agency’s vessels infringe Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty. Bunker fuel is subject to excise duty and, under Article 2 of that directive, is subject to that duty from the point it is imported into the Community and placed on the market in the corresponding Member State. The bunker fuel is being placed on the market in Romania, but it is not being declared. This unfair trading practice is also a threat to the ecological balance of the Danube region, since there is a high risk of spillage during ship‑to‑ship refuelling at mooring stations. In the light of the above, can the Commission state: 1. whether it does not consider this unfair trading practice to violate the customs union; 2. whether it does not consider the fact that the bunker fuel is not subject to excise duty to constitute unfair competition between Cosmos Energy Ltd and F&M Agency; 3. what preventive measures it will take to safeguard biodiversity on the River Danube?
