public non-commercial use without authorisation of the right holder through compulsory licensing; reiterates also that developing countries should be encouraged to seek EC technical assistance to collaborate with appropriate manufacturers to realise cheaper and wider access to medication and treatment for those in need; 46. Recognises that the basic laws of demand and supply if applied to countries characterised by limited purchasing power will not be favourable to attracting the R&D effort of pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs against communicable diseases; proposes therefore that the Sixth Framework Programme devote considerable funding to research into diseases of the poor, and that cooperative projects with research or public institutes or private-public partnerships intended to benefit poverty-stricken countries, should be given priority; 47. Requests the Commission to take the initiative for a proposal for neglected diseases (such as trypanosomiasis, filariasis, bilharzia and ebola); considers that this proposal should provide incentive for the development of drugs and vaccines destined to combat poverty-related diseases for which there is a limited market; 48. Emphasises in particular the need to guarantee over the long term increased and reliable financing for R&D relating to "forgotten diseases" through a public commitment in the form of an international treaty; 49. Regrets that countries that have made use of the safeguard clause in the TRIPS Agreement have come under pressure to withdraw their legislation in this area; considers, on the contrary, that the Commission and the Member States should defend in the appropriate fora the right of developing countries to use all the safeguard clauses provided by TRIPS (compulsory licensing, parallel importation, generic production of essential pharmaceutical products, "Bolar” provisions) in the circumstances specified in the agreement and, if necessary, to request adaptation of the TRIPS rules in the WHO; 50. Stresses that an appropriate increase in human resources, with expertise in social and human development, pharmaceutical policies and procurement, health, education and gender, be made available to the Commission, including the EC Delegations abroad, for the Programme for Action to be properly implemented and monitored; 51. Calls on the EU to support the development of substantial, sustained and efficient global financing mechanisms to enhance and extend existing funding to improve health in developing countries; considers that the EU should develop appropriate instruments to allow substantial contributions to emerging global health financing mechanisms and that allocations to a global fund should be additional to existing aid efforts and be framed in the context of health as a global public good; 52. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the WTO, WHO, UNAIDS, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the African Union, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and relevant NGOs (OXFAM, Médecins sans frontières).
