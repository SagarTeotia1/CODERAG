Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (22 September 2008) The study quoted by the Honourable Member was carried out by a consortium led by the European Trade Union Confederation and the Social Development Agency with the financial support of the Commission (Environment Directorate-General). It should be considered as providing support for social dialogue with an eye to the challenge of climate change, and can be consulted at http://www.etuc.org/a/3676 The study concludes that there is broadly an overall positive impact on employment. The findings on the latter are broadly consistent with those estimated by the Commission on the basis of general equilibrium models under its proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % up to 2020 COM(2008)30 final of 23 January 2008. , allowing for the differences in target and timescale (40 % by 2030 against 20 % by 2020). The Commission is aware of the risk of negative impacts on employment for certain sectors and is of the opinion that these negative impacts will have to be prevented. As far as the repercussions on and opportunities for employment are concerned, climate change is regarded as one of the new social realities justifying policy change in the renewed Social Agenda COM(2008)412 final of 2 July 2008. , which stresses the potential of social dialogue. Furthermore, by way of follow-up to its Green Paper on adaptation to climate change Adapting to climate change in Europe: Options for EU action, COM(2007)354 final. the Commission is drafting a white paper on this issue which will pay special attention to the social and employment impact.
