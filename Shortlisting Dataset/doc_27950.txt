WRITTEN QUESTION P-0836/06 by Françoise Grossetête (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (24 February 2006) Subject: Cohesion policy and urban areas — measures to take account of satellite towns The European Commission is seeking to develop a cohesion and urban policy with a view to fostering growth and employment in the regions. Very often these policies focus on cities, neglecting urban areas situated on the outskirts of cities, so-called satellite towns, even though they play a key role in economic and social development as a whole, in particular by providing industrial and commercial sites and housing for new arrivals. How does the European Commission plan to take account of satellite towns in the programmes it wishes to implement (cohesion and urban policy, ERDF, involvement of satellite towns in European projects, Urbact, etc.)?
