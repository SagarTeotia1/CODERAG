Reply (2 March 2009) The Council has on a number of occasions condemned the anti-Israeli statements made by Iran's leaders, which are unacceptable and damaging. The EU has asked Iran to refrain from threats against any other State in the international community. As regards the crisis between Iran and the international community over the nature of Iran's nuclear programme, the Council is fully behind the démarche by SG/HR Javier Solana and six States (Germany, China, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Russia) to find a diplomatic solution. The Council will not spare any effort to achieve a peaceful, negotiated solution. It is, however, up to Iran to restore confidence as to the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme by fulfilling the international obligations laid down in Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747, 1803 and 1835, which call on Iran to suspend its uranium-enrichment activities. Following the meeting in Geneva on 19 July 2008 between SG/HR Solana and nuclear negotiator Saïd Jalili, the Council has been developing persistent efforts to get a clear and positive response from Iran to the international community's proposal to embark on a pre-negotiation phase of a maximum of six weeks, prior to the formal opening of negotiations. During this preparatory phase Iran would not increase the number of its centrifuges and the Six and the EU would not adopt new sanctions (‘double freeze’). The Iranian regime must now choose between the path of cooperation and the prospect of growing isolation.
