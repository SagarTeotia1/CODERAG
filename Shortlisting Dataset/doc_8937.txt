Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (27 February 2012) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑010848/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB . The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (hereafter referred to as ‘the Convention’) applies to the EU within the limits of its competences attested by the Declaration of Competence in Annex II of Council Decision 2010/48/EC of 26 November 2009 concluding the Convention. This Declaration lists the Community acts by which the Member States under the EU Treaties have transferred competences to the Union in areas covered by the Convention. Social protection of persons with disabilities, including the provision of disability-related allowances, is foremost a matter falling within the competence of the Member States. In this area, the Commission has no competence to make an assessment of compatibility of a national law or of national measures with the UN Convention.
