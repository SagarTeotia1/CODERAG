Question for written answer E-3803/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (1 June 2010) Subject: Social and environmental standards for the free trade agreement between Colombia and the European Union On 18 May 2010, Parliament adopted Franziska Keller's report on EU policy coherence for development and the ‘official development assistance plus concept’ (ODA‑plus). In paragraph 70 of the aforementioned report, Parliament ‘asks the Commission to include legally binding social and environmental standards systematically in trade agreements negotiated by the European Union, in order to promote the objective of trade working for development’. Can the Commission say whether it believes that social standards, working conditions and progress made in these areas were examined during talks leading to the free trade agreement between Colombia and the European Union?
