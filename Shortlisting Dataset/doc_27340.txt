Question for written answer E-4958/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jan Březina (PPE) (7 July 2010) Subject: Discrimination against combined heat and power At the meeting of the Climate Change working group of the Council in May 2010 the European Commission proposed that, in the context of laying down the method of free allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Article 10c of Directive 2009/29/EC OJ L 140, 5.6.2009 , p. 63. , combined heat and power installations be excluded from the scope of Article 10c. In the light of this, the Commission is requested to answer the following questions. In making this proposal is the European Commission not going beyond the scope of the Directive, which does not exclude combined heat and power generation from the field of application of Article 10c? Does the European Commission not consider this approach to constitute discrimination against combined heat and power generation? How does the Commission explain this approach in the light of the fact that elsewhere in European law (for example, in Directive 2004/8/EC OJ L 52, 21.2.2004 , pp. 50–60. ), combined heat and power generation is designated as a priority in view of its benefits, particularly with regard to primary energy savings, elimination of energy losses on the grid, and emissions reductions?
