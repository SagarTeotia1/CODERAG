Question for written answer E-000334/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Marina Yannakoudakis (ECR) (19 January 2012) Subject: Commission funding for various EU orchestras Can the Commission confirm how much it cumulatively spends annually on the various EU orchestras, inter alia the European Union Youth Orchestra, the European Union Baroque Orchestra, the European Union Chamber Orchestra, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the European Opera Centre Trust and the European Jazz Orchestra? Please include grants from DG Education and Culture as well as any fees, travelling expenses and other payments made to these orchestras for Commission-sponsored performances or events in EU Member States or third countries. Can the Commission also justify the seemingly unnecessary duplication of funding for both the European Union Chamber Orchestra and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe?
