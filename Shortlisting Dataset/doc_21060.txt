WRITTEN QUESTION E-4963/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (11 October 2007) Subject: India FTA and weapons to Burma In January, the Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee promised to give a ‘favourable response’ to the Burmese military junta's request for military equipment and in April 2007 it was reported that Indian and Burmese security forces were ‘conducting joint military operations’ along the 1643 km Indo-Burmese border to neutralise insurgent groups. India has not reported on any arms transfers to Burma to the UN. Burma's military cooperation with the Indian Government in dealing with these groups has been reportedly linked with the Indian Government's offer to supply a variety of military hardware, such as tanks, aircraft, artillery guns, radar, small arms and advanced light helicopters. Is the Commission aware of India's recent trading relationship with the Burmese military junta and their recent military cooperation? What pressure has the Commission brought to bear upon India to cease the trading of weapons to Burma, notably within the context of the EU's negotiations with India over the free trade agreement? Will the Commission call on India to immediately suspend the supply to Burma of all direct and indirect transfers of military and security equipment, munitions and expertise, including transfers claimed to be ‘non-lethal’? Does the Commission consider that the need for India and Burma to cooperate militarily over the 1643 km Indo-Burmese border indicates a possible threat, if not to international, to regional peace and security? Is the Commission supporting a comprehensive international arms embargo against Burma and will it be actively seeking India's support for such an embargo?
