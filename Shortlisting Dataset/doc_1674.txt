Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (6 March 2007) The Commission is dedicated to eliminating inequalities and promoting gender equality throughout the European Union. The principal method for doing so is anti-discrimination legislation, ensuring a uniform level of protection against discrimination. The Commission, being aware of gender-related differences of treatment in several areas of everyday life, took action and launched a process leading to the adoption of Council Directive 2004/113/EC. This directive implements the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the area of access to and supply of goods and services OJ L 373, 21,12.2004. . It prohibits direct and indirect discrimination based on sex as well as sexual harassment in this area. Member States are required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive by 21 December 2007 at the latest. Having regard to Article 10 of the EC Treaty, a Member State must refrain from taking any measures liable seriously to compromise the result prescribed by the directive. It is for the national court to assess whether that is the case considering, in particular, the effects in practice of applying the incompatible provisions and of their duration in time.
