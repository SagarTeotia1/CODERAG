Question for written answer E-010239/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Aldo Patriciello (PPE) (10 November 2011) Subject: Protection of Bank of Ireland securities' investors Debt restructuring, which is regulated by Article 182(a) of the Italian ‘bankruptcy law’ (Royal Decree No 267 of 16 March 1942), is a process that allows a public body or privately-owned company in financial distress or facing insolvency to renegotiate debt. However, the debt restructuring carried out by the Bank of Ireland is of a questionable nature, involving not only investments by managing directors of companies and banks, but also those of many savers. By providing incomplete information, the Irish credit institution was able to speculate on investments in its securities by proposing an opportunist provision which, if the offer was approved, allowed bonds to be exchanged for new bonds guaranteed by the State or, if refused, resulted in a haircut that discounted invested capital to one ten thousandth of its value, thereby causing some 200 Italian investors to lose, involuntarily, their right to subscribe to the swap. To make matters even worse, there is uncertainty over whether the right of individual investors, of whom there are around 200 in Italy, to be bondholders as the prospectus for the bonds clearly stated that retail or individual savers could not purchase the bonds, making investment of the securities in Italy impossible therefore, except with registered stockbrokers. In light of the above, how could the Commission have allowed the Bank of Ireland, which has often been labelled the most speculative bank in Ireland, to carry out debt restructuring without any kind of obligation being imposed to inform investors who, without being given a choice, have seen their investments vanish? Does the Commission not feel that, under an ethical principle of justice, it should take steps to protect ‘duped’ investors? Or, alternatively, is it contemplating any disciplinary action against the Bank of Ireland for acting in a morally unjust way, as well as in regard to the Italian credit institutions that sold these securities to Italian investors?
