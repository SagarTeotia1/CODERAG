WRITTEN QUESTION P-3599/10 by Lena Ek (ALDE) to the Commission (14 May 2010) Subject: Link between the Europe 2020 Strategy, the Budget Review and the SET-Plan The Budget Review now seems unlikely to be completed before the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is proposed in 2011, because Commission President Barroso wants prior agreement on the Europe 2020 Strategy — scheduled for the June European Council. There is a risk that the Europe 2020 Strategy may replace the Budget Review in the context of decisions on future spending priorities. The importance of settling budgetary details, which have thus far not been included in the Europe 2020 Strategy, is highlighted by the case of the low-carbon Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan), which needs EUR 31 billion in extra public money for the 2010‑20 period. In order to agree on the necessary large new commitments of both EU and national public money, the EU institutions will need to establish mechanisms for blending resources/coordinating expenditure, and for advancing sums ahead of the 2014‑20 MFF period. Given that the SET-Plan is supposed to run from 2010 to 2020, can the Commission please explain when final decisions will be taken to ensure that it is financed? Moreover, how is this decision linked to the pending Budget Review? Can the Commission also clarify whether there are proposals to advance funds for the 2010‑14 period through the European Investment Bank (EIB), making a deficit allocation under the 2014‑20 MFF in order to ensure that the EIB is repaid?
