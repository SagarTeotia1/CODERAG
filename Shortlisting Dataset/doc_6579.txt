{ "context": [ [ "Poa pratensis", [ "Poa pratensis, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass, smooth meadow-grass, or common meadow-grass, is a perennial species of grass native to practically all of Europe, northern Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco.", " Although the species is spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the U.S., it is not native to North America.", " Early European colonists brought seed of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses.", " \"Poa pratensis\" forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil.", " It is also used for making lawns in parks and gardens and is common in cool moist climates like the northeastern United States.", " When found on native grasslands in North America, however, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape." ] ], [ "Andropogon", [ "Andropogon (common names: beard grass, bluestem grass, broomsedge) is a widespread genus of plants in the grass family, native to much of Asia, Africa, and the Americas as well as southern Europe and various oceanic islands." ] ], [ "Centaurea cyanus", [ "Centaurea cyanus, commonly known as cornflower or bachelor's button, is an annual flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to Europe.", " In the past it often grew as a weed in cornfields (in the broad sense of the word \"corn\", referring to grains, such as wheat, barley, rye, or oats), hence its name.", " It is now endangered in its native habitat by agricultural intensification, particularly over-use of herbicides, destroying its habitat.", " It is also, however, through introduction as an ornamental plant in gardens and a seed contaminant in crop seeds, now naturalised in many other parts of the world, including North America and parts of Australia." ] ], [ "Exploitation colonialism", [ "Exploitation colonialism is the national economic policy of conquering a country to exploit its natural resources and its native population.", " The practice of exploitation colonialism contrasts with settler colonialism, the policy of conquering a country to establish a branch of the metropole (Motherland), and for the exploitation of its natural resources and native population.", " A colonialist power pursues settler colonialism to relieve the pressures of over-population upon the economy and the national territory of the motherland, and to extend its territory and culture by reproducing its society in other parts of the world.", " A reason for which a country might practice exploitation colonialism is the immediate financial gain produced by the low-cost extraction of raw materials by means of a native people, usually administered by a colonial government." ] ], [ "Brassica elongata", [ "Brassica elongata, the elongated mustard or long-stalked rape, is a species of the mustard plant that is native to parts of Central Europe, Eastern Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, the Caucasus, Morocco and parts of Central Asia.", " Through plant invasion this species has become naturalized in many other parts of the world.", " Some of these naturalized regions include South Africa, North Western Europe, Australia and North America.", "
