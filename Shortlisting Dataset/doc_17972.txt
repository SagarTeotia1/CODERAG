WRITTEN QUESTION E-3510/06 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (26 July 2006) Subject: Financial framework for the RURIS programme (2000‑06) The RURIS programme in Portugal, falling under the Community support framework for 2000‑06, consisted of rural development measures, with particular referendum to the former CAP accompanying measures (early retirement, compensatory payments to less-favoured regions, agri-environmental measures) and to other measures such as afforestation of agriculture land, with national co‑financing. Can the Commission state: 1. what were the total annual amounts allocated to the RURIS programme in Portugal over the period 2000‑06; 2. what the breakdown was between national and EU contributions and what the distribution was between the four interventions or measures (early retirement, compensatory payments to less-favoured regions, agri-environmental measures and afforestation of agriculture land) — in other words, what the financial frameworks approved in 1999 were for the rural development plan RURIS 2000‑06, including the alterations which were proposed by the Portuguese Government after that date and were approved by the Commission; 3. what the execution rate was for the RURIS programme, broken down by year and priority; 4. what the indicative amount approved by the Commission is for the new financial framework for 2007‑13?
