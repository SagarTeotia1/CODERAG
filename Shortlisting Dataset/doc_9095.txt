virtually standard practice in the case of initiatives originating in either the Council or Member States on which Parliament simply needs to be consulted. Sometimes, even, no sooner does the procedure for consulting Parliament get under way than agreements are reached within the Council (in particular as 'A' items). It is in no way in the interests of Parliament, as a democratic institution representing Europe's citizens, to go along with what is basically a mug's game. 3. Rejection – making a political point Parliament recently adopted, by a very large majority, a recommendation calling on the Council to replace the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention) by a Council decision based on Article 34(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union. As a result of such a decision: - Europol would be taken out of the ordinary intergovernmental cooperation framework and incorporated into the Community system; - all implementing measures would be adopted by the Council acting by a qualified majority; - Parliament's rights would be guaranteed, with the possibility of bringing actions before the Court of Justice; - Europol could be funded, at least in part, from the EU budget, the very fact of which would strengthen democratic oversight over its activities. To date, no action is known to have been taken by the Council on Parliament's recommendation. In your rapporteur's view, it is not in the interests of Parliament, which has been no more than a legislative pygmy in such matters to date, to behave like a political pygmy too. In view of all these factors, your rapporteur proposes that, regardless of substance, the Europol initiative submitted to us be rejected by Parliament.
