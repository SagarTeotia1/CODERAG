that they need to act in an economically sound way and that the EU needs economic champions to compete globally; 28. Stresses, however, that there is widespread concern about market dominance by bigger actors, who are often perceived to impose unfair terms on weaker suppliers and retailers, for instance through unjustified mechanisms of selective distribution, geographical segmentation, price control, delisting without notice, and other restrictive practices, thereby distorting competition; underlines that the entire retail supply chain is affected by such practices; denounces practices that misuse power imbalance between economic actors and affect true freedom of contract; stresses that raising all actors’ awareness of their contractual rights, especially SMEs, would contribute to preventing these practices; 29. Recognises that franchising is a good formula for independent retailers to survive in a highly competitive environment; notes with concern that the contracts for retailers to be part of a franchise are becoming more and more rigorous; 30. Emphasises that private labels should be developed in such a way as to deliver improved consumer choice, notably in terms of transparency, quality of information and diversity, and to provide clear opportunities for SMEs to innovate and expand; 31. Considers that ‘parasitic copying’, which can result, inter alia, from the retailer’s dual role as the customer and competitor of brand manufacturers, is an unacceptable practice that should be addressed without delay; welcomes the fact that the Commission is conducting an analysis to further clarify the legal frameworks and practices relating to trade secrets and ‘parasitic copying’ within the 27 EU Member States; 32. Recognises the need for more balanced relations and transparency in the retail supply chain; stresses the need to move from confrontation to dialogue based on facts, in order to restore confidence and enable fairer negotiations and a level playing field for all, thus enabling all economic actors in supply chains to benefit from the added-value of their products and reap the full benefits from the Single Market; 33. Urges the Commission and Member States to fully and coherently enforce competition law and, where applicable at national level, unfair competition and anti-trust law; 34. Stresses that, to ensure proper implementation of competition rules and prevent abuse of a dominant position, it is first and foremost necessary to strengthen the local competition watchdog authorities and ensure continuous and uninterrupted lines of communication and cooperation between them and the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition; 35. Supports the good work of the Experts Platform on B2B contractual practices of the High Level Forum for a Better Functioning Food Supply Chain, in particular to define, list and assess what constitutes a manifestly unfair commercial practice, based on data and concrete examples; calls for strong support of initiatives for dialogue between parties on this issue; is concerned that the European Parliament is not formally involved in the work of the Platform and the High Level Forum; considers that the Parliament should urgently address this matter and should actively participate in the Forum’s work; 36. Supports the need expressed by stakeholders to take a broader and horizontal approach, extending the scope beyond the agro-food
