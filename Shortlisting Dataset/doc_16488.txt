Seventh Research Framework Programme MEPs propose to use the EUR 500 million of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) which was held back until the mid-term review of the Seventh Research Framework Programme. According to the rapporteur, this amount could be supplemented with other funds in cooperation with the European Investment Bank. Selection criteria for projects When it comes to selecting storage sites, "binding and strict criteria should be set for long-term safety", says the Industry Committee. It cites the example of "storage under the seabed, which can, in the event of an accident, endanger marine ecosystems". This could have implications for the UK, which would have the option of storing large quantities of CO² under the North Sea. The report also strongly recommends that the 12 demonstration projects have a minimum output of 180 Mega Watts, and that the facilities be sited over a maximum geographical spread across the EU.

The report calls upon the Council to examine the question of the language options of the website of its Presidencies, in order to ensure that the entire population of the EU has easy access to information. Context In 2004, the petitioner, an association for the defence of the German language, wrote to the Dutch and the Luxembourg governments to ask them to offer the internet presentations they were to provide when holding the Presidency not only in English and French but also in German. Both the Dutch and the Luxembourg governments rejected the complainant's request. On 22 January 2005, the complainant wrote to the Council and, in its reply of 4 March 2005, the Council pointed out that the Member State holding the Presidency was solely responsible for the information published on its website. The Ombudsman was not satisfied with the Council reply, and, therefore, made a proposal for a friendly solution inviting the Council to consider the complainant's request that the Presidencies' websites should be made available in German.
