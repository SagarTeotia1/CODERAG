Question for written answer P-006204/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Edit Herczog (S&D) (27 June 2011) Subject: Product fee legislation on waste and repealing certain directives On 8 June 2011 the Hungarian Parliament debated draft law No T/3387 on the environmental product fee, which was submitted as a representatives’ own motion. The draft was submitted prior to adoption of the second National Waste Management Plan, the transposition of the Waste Framework Directive. In addition, the submitters were not familiar either with the legislation governing implementation of this directive or with the draft legislation governing implementation of the draft law. The product fee legislation promotes implementation of the requirements set down in Directive 2008/98/EC on waste and repealing certain Directives (hereinafter: the Waste Framework Directive), Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators, Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste electrical and electronic equipment, Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on end-of-life vehicles and Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste. The basic principle shared by these directives is that of producer responsibility, on the basis of which producers must be given the opportunity to choose whether they wish to fulfil their environmental commitments in the event of products produced by them becoming waste individually or jointly. It appears from the provisions that Hungary legally prevents producers from formulating joint, independent regulations on the use of waste. Before the law was enacted, the EU Waste Framework Directive was not codified in Hungarian law. As a result, the objectives and range of instruments of the proposal cannot be identified with the EU’s objectives and range of instruments. What measures will the Commission take to ensure that the principle of producer responsibility is implemented in Hungary?
