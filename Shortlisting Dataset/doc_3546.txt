Question for written answer E-4738/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) (25 June 2010) Subject: Violation of the national general collective bargaining agreement in Greece In accordance with Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which have the same legal value as the Treaties. Article 28 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (on the right of collective bargaining and action) provides for and safeguards: — the right of workers and employers or their respective organisations, in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices, to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate level, and — the corresponding obligation on the part of the Member States to refrain from interfering in the system of free negotiation, and to respect the results of free negotiations as set out in collective bargaining agreements. Can the Commission answer the following questions: Are the permanent measures taken in Greece to implement the international financial support mechanism, to which the EU is also contributing, compatible with Community legislation on respect for free collective bargaining and collective agreements? Does the Commission agree that these measures impinge on and violate the national system of collective bargaining that has been in force for decades and that provides a safeguard for the right of all workers without distinction to benefit from the national general collective bargaining agreement in order to decide on minimum wage levels and working conditions through free collective negotiation, since the new measures introduce: 1. The possibility of a derogation from the minimum protected levels laid down in the national general collective bargaining agreement in relation to the wages paid to young people up to the age of 25 in every sector of employment, and 2. Local employment agreements which may lay down less favourable rules than those stipulated in both the corresponding collective agreements and the national general collective bargaining agreement?
