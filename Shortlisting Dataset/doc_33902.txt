Question for written answer E-010553/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE) (20 December 2010) Subject: Agricultural production compromised by effects of weather conditions ‘Freezing rain’ is a rare meteorological phenomenon arising when rain or sleet fall in conditions where the ground temperature is below freezing point and the rainfall thus forms a layer of ice on the ground surface. This occurred in Romania at the beginning of December 2010, causing considerable damage. Can the Commission state what measures it will consider, in the context of the future of the CAP, to support farmers in the face of weather conditions that affect agriculture and farming activities?
