Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (21 September 2005) The Commission has carried out a review on the healthcare system in Bulgaria in November 2004 and a review on the social care system in July 2005 which also included healthcare aspects. The reviews incorporated questions concerning the availability of medicinal products, generally and more specifically the distribution and provision of those products to/for vulnerable groups. A number of recommendations have been made to the Bulgarian Government for improving the situation. Amongst others, they were directed to the restrictions of reimbursement or non-availability of certain medicinal products for certain groups of patients. The Commission will follow up the implementation of the recommendations during its current monitoring process under the Europe agreement which includes a continuous dialogue with the Bulgarian Government, the professional healthcare organisations and the relevant non-governmental organisations.
