WRITTEN QUESTION E-0771/09 by Georgios Georgiou (IND/DEM) to the Commission (11 February 2009) Subject: Protection of young people from pornography The three types of criminal activity with the greatest profits worldwide are the arms business, drugs trafficking and pornography. With the massive development of the Internet, young people with basic Internet skills are able to open webpages and access free photographs and videos of women being tortured by men, thereby reproducing the model of supposed male ‘superiority’; they are encouraged to do likewise. So far, neither the European Union nor the Council of Europe has taken effective measures to eradicate this phenomenon. Which measures does the Commission intend to take (and when) to eradicate this phenomenon?
