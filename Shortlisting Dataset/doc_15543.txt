General remarks Your draftsman wishes to give a qualified appraisal of the favourable trend of appropriations relating to the Lisbon strategy as reflected in the changes in the chapters of the PDB. Under the multiannual financial arrangements for 2007-2013, the appropriations in the PDB have been arranged in 7 titles, two of which can be seen to be partly inspired by the logic underpinning the Lisbon strategy. The growth in the funding allocated to them is comparable to an overall budget increase of +4.6%. For example: - The commitments under the heading of Competitiveness for growth and employment increase by +11.5% to € 8796.1 million and include the expenditure relating to the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (+53.6%), trans-European networks (+18%) and the seventh framework research programme (+3.4%). - The commitments under the heading of Cohesion for growth and employment, which correspond to the structural funds, increase for their part by + 14.8 % to € 45,486.6 million. These appropriations are divided up between a number of fields of activity, viz. economic and financial affairs, enterprise, environment, information society, energy and transport, most of which do not come under the direct responsibility of ECON but do contribute to implementation of the Lisbon strategy. This overall favourable trend of commitments must of course be reflected in the headings with a direct bearing on the European economy. While the relative growth of appropriations is moving in the right direction, their growth in absolute terms for the headings making an effective contribution to the expenditure relating to competitiveness, support for SMEs and aid for innovation remains nevertheless modest on account of the initial amounts involved. 2.
