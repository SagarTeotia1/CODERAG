it intends to amend the Commission proposal substantially; 4. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and the Commission. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The proposed amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas is closely linked to the Visa Information System (VIS) to be established by the VIS Regulation. Once the VIS becomes operational, it will retrieve the relevant application file for a visa from the visa sticker number. Therefore, a unique visa sticker number is a precondition for the proper functioning of the VIS. Since the current provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 and the additional technical specifications have not led to a unique visa numbering in the Member States, the wording of the Annex of Regulation No 1683/95 needs to be changed in order to ensure a harmonised visa sticker number before the VIS enters into force. This being the objective of the proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 the Rapporteur suggests approving the Commission proposal without amendments.
