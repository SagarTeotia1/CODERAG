WRITTEN QUESTION E-1131/09 by Anne Laperrouze (ALDE) and Jean Marie Beaupuy (ALDE) to the Council (24 February 2009) Subject: The Solidarity Fund Since the French regions of Aquitaine, Midi-Pyrenees and Languedoc-Roussillon suffered severe damage during the Klaus storm at the end of January 2009, the legitimacy of the Solidarity Fund's existence is no longer in question. In May 2005 the European Parliament adopted the Berend report ( P6_TA(2006)0218 ) on the revision of the Solidarity Fund with a view to extending its reach and improving its performance. At present the matter remains at a standstill, pending the Council's first reading. Yet it is imperative that it soon be brought to a positive conclusion, as the revision will lead, amongst other things, to faster and more effective implementation of the Solidarity Fund, and, by a lowering of the damage threshold from 0.6 % of the gross national income to 0.5 %, the fund will be able to come to the aid of a greater number of European victims of major disasters. Not having received a satisfactory response to the Regional Development Committee's oral question of 17 November 2008 ( O-0092/2008 — B6-0472/2008 ), we ask again: — what is really preventing the prompt adoption of this revision? — what is the estimated time-scale? European citizens expect the European Union to come decisively to their aid, not only by providing emergency aid, but also by completing the revision of the Solidarity Fund. To them that would be solid proof that the European Union has what it takes to be at their side when times are hard.
