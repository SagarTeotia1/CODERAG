WRITTEN QUESTION E-4342/08 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Council (29 July 2008) Subject: Measures in response to the problem of increasing oil prices At the recent meeting of the EU Council of Finance Ministers (8-9 July 2008), one of the basic issues under discussion was the increase in the price of oil. The Council decided that the appropriate response was to publish weekly data concerning oil stocks. This measure alone can obviously not help to solve the problem of increasing oil prices. In view of this, how and when does the Council intend to ensure that radical and effective measures are taken in response to the problem?
