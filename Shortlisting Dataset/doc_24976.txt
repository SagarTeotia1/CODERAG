Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (27 July 2011) The EU is aware of accusations of xenophobic behaviour in South Africa. Within the framework of the South Africa — EU Strategic Partnership, an in-depth political dialogue on migration matters, as well as an informal dialogue on human rights has been established, allowing for open and frank discussions encompassing the themes related to xenophobic violence in the country. The South African government has taken steps to tackle xenophobic violence. In the summer and autumn of 2009, South Africa experienced an upsurge of strikes and violent protests in townships and informal settlements over a lack of basic services and xenophobic attacks. Predicted outbursts of xenophobic violence following the 2010 World Cup did not materialize due to swift and decisive action undertaken by the police. The EU will continue to engage South African authorities on this issue which remains their responsibility.
