WRITTEN QUESTION P-2658/04 by Cem Özdemir (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (21 October 2004) Subject: Forest fires in the Tunceli region of Turkey Reports are reaching us from Turkey of forest fires in the Munzur National Park in the Tunceli region of that country. The information comes from eyewitnesses and a press release issued from Tunceli by the Turkish MP Hasan Göyüldar. According to these eyewitness reports, the forest fires were the result of armed clashes. At all events, fires have also deliberately been started by the security forces because militant groups use the forests as hideaways. There are also reports that the security forces have prevented local inhabitants from putting out the fires. A priceless natural heritage area, home to many plants and animals, is in danger. Is the Commission aware of these events and the background to them? How can these events be reconciled with existing agreements and the objectives of European-Turkish cooperation? What action does the Commission plan to take?
