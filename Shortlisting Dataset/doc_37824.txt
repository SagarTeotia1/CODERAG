WRITTEN QUESTION E-5521/09 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Commission (13 November 2009) Subject: European projects in the western Balkans In a special report on the effectiveness of European projects in the western Balkans (‘Special Report No 12/2009 — The effectiveness of the Commission’s projects in the area of Justice and Home Affairs for the western Balkans’) the Court of Auditors gives a few examples of ineffective allocation and use of equipment funded by the EU. For instance, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia some of the EU‑financed motorcycles supplied to the border police in the summer of 2005 were hardly used for the first 18 months because the government had not provided the police with the necessary protective gear as agreed. Some pieces of equipment were still missing in 2007. The government launched the complementary equipment tender in September 2008 and the contract was due to be signed during the first quarter of 2009 (page 15). Has that contract now been signed and is the police in possession of the extra protective equipment, so that the motorcycles can finally be put into use? How much was the total cost price of the motorcycles and the cost price of purchasing them in the country of their intended use? How will the Commission be ensuring that this state of affairs is avoided in future?
