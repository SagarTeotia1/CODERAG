Answer given by Baroness Ashton on behalf of the Commission (5 November 2009) The EU does not have a trade agreement with Myanmar (Burma). The Commission has been authorised by the Council to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. However, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar (Burma) are not included in any agreement, as they are Least Developed Countries. The EC remains open to include Myanmar (Burma) if the country improves its human rights record and democratic credentials.
