Question for written answer E-000633/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (27 January 2012) Subject: Oil spills: rules for prevention and protection against environmental disasters On 17 December 2011 off the coast of Livorno, a Grimaldo Lines cargo ship lost 34 tonnes of catalysts containing heavy metals used for the processing of oil. Still today, no fewer than 198 containers of dangerous substances remain dispersed off the Tuscan coast, with risks not yet well identified.The 2 300 tonnes of fuel oil held in the hull of the Costa Concordia, which ran aground on 13 January 2012 off the island of Giglio, pose a threat to a protected natural marine area of international interest. Such events once again demonstrate the importance of intervention by the European Union to ensure the protection of the marine environment. Current European regulations require harmonisation and uniform application by all Member States, particularly in terms of safety, deterrence and response capabilities in the face of oil spill emergencies, the improvement of checks by public authorities, the strengthening of disaster response capabilities and greater international cooperation. Can the Commission report on the harmonisation process and on the extension of the scope of the main Community directives on environmental responsibility, in particular of Directive 2003/105/EC on control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, Directive 2004/35/EC on the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, Directive 2005/35/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/23/EC) on ship-source pollution, Directive 2008/56/EC on marine strategy and Directive 2008/99/EC on the protection of the environment through criminal law?
