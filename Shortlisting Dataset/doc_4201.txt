Question for written answer E-009701/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (26 October 2011) Subject: EU action to defend religious freedom of Coptic Christians Across the world, Coptic Christians are protesting ever more loudly against the killings which continue to take place in Egypt and which over recent days have claimed dozens of lives. In contrast, the European institutions are almost completely silent on the subject. Does the Commission not intend to take concrete and decisive steps to remind the Egyptian Government of its duty to protect the Coptic Christian minority, prevent any acts of violence from being perpetrated against its members and ensure that they are able fully to exercise their right to religious freedom?
