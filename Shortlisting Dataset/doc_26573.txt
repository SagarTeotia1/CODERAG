Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (24 September 2009) The Commission is informed of what happened on 10 July 2009 in Candelaria when five members of an organisation called ‘Movimiento contra las Altas Tarifas de Energia Eléctrica’ were arrested by the Mexican federal police. The Commission is aware of the Human Rights situation in Mexico, which is a priority issue in its relations with the country. It is closely monitoring the situation, notably through its Delegation in the country. It is committed to work with the Mexican authorities to support their efforts to carry out proper investigations and to implement measures aimed at resolving such cases of intimidation of Human Rights defenders. Human Rights were on the agenda of the EU‑Mexico Joint Council meeting held in May 2009 in Prague. During this ministerial meeting, both parties restated their interest in improving the protection of human rights in particular through the exchange of experiences, based on the principle of reciprocity. Through its cooperation programmes, the Commission is funding some Human Rights projects in the country. Regarding the proposal made of ‘inquiries or request’, the Commission favours the idea of a regular and structured dialogue on Human Rights with the Mexican authorities. The EU is currently negotiating with the latter the modalities to initiate such a dialogue, as decided by the Council of Ministers in November 2008. The Commission attaches great importance to this new mechanism which is an essential component of the EU‑Mexico Strategic Partnership with Mexico.
