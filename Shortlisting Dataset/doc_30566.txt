9999/C Q999 E/059 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1294/04 by Nelly Maes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (19 April 2004) Subject: Bulgaria and the Civil Society Development project/BG 0104.03 The answers given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission on 25 February 2004 to written questions E-3972/03 , E-3973/03 and E-4011/03 to E-4014/03 OJ C give rise to the following further questions concerning the Commission's work in Bulgaria on the project 'Civil Society Development'/BG 0104.03. According to the project form, the steering group for the programme should have started work in December 2001 but actually did so only in September 2003. Why did the official responsible within the EU delegation decide that the steering group should start work so late? Why was the second subsidy stage of component II (regional competitions for local NGOs) not carried out? How can the Commission maintain that the Bulgarian authorities bear sole responsibility for the delays and for the components of this project which were not implemented, when the final decisions on all matters were taken by the EU delegation? What measures will the EU delegation in Sofia take to prevent such delays and the omission of components in the implementation of future EU programmes to strengthen civil society development in Bulgaria? What is the view of the EU delegation in Bulgaria concerning the criticism from the civil society sector that, in competitions for EU financing of civil society development in the country (outside Sofia) in the past 4-5 years, the EU has cooperated only with a small number of NGOs - and always with the same ones? What is the political impact of such favouritism on the further democratisation of the country?
