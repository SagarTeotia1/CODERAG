Security Council Resolution 1769(2007), which authorises the deployment of an AU/UN force of 26 000 soldiers in Darfur, which will help to pacify the whole region in combination with the deployment of a UN police force and the planned ESDP operation in the eastern part of Chad and the northern part of CAR, D. supporting the efforts of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to find a negotiated solution to the conflict in Darfur by promoting contacts between the Sudanese authorities and the various rebel groups, E. welcoming the signing in N’Djamena on 13 August 2007 by all the Chadian political parties of an agreement aimed at reinforcing the democratic process in Chad, F. noting the efforts by the Libyan leadership to find a solution to the internal conflict in Chad with the groups which did not sign the previous agreement, 1. Calls upon the Council, the Commission and the UN to coordinate their efforts in order to create the conditions that would enable the different parties to the conflict in the broader region of Darfur/Eastern Chad/Northern CAR to find a political solution which would put an end to insecurity and the subsequent humanitarian disaster, thus facilitating the return of the refugees and internally displaced persons to their villages of origin; 2. Gives its approval for the launch of an ESDP operation in the eastern part of Chad and the northern part of CAR, which will last for one year, but makes its consent conditional on the fulfilment of the following conditions: (a) the mission of the European force (EUFOR) has to be to support humanitarian activities and to create the conditions for a secure environment for the work of the UN police force, the return of the internally displaced persons and the continuation of the dialogue between the political forces in the region, (b) while it is anticipated that French forces will make up the bulk of the EU contingent, it is extremely important that EUFOR is seen to be impartial and not as an extension of France’s military capabilities in the region, (c) at the same time, and in order to avoid becoming itself a target, EUFOR must remain neutral with regard to the complex political situation in the region by refusing to become involved in fights between governmental authorities and rebel groups, (d) EUFOR has to work as a deterrent, which means that it must have a robust mandate under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and clear rules of engagement allowing the use of force when necessary, especially in the event of attacks on civilians, camps and villages, humanitarian workers or UN police officers, as well as in self-defence, (e) in order to deter any potential aggressor, EUFOR must have the necessary number of troops and must be equipped appropriately. It must be able to secure its supply lines and conduct long-range patrols with armoured vehicles, helicopters (including transport and attack helicopters) and reconnaissance planes; (f) EUFOR must be considered as a ‘bridging force’ with a temporary mandate. A clear exit strategy must therefore be defined before the deployment
