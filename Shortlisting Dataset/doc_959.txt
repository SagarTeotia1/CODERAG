accomplishment of their regulatory and supervision duties which are here summarized for easier comprehension in three groups according to severity. Again, a reference to the time-frame related to the application of the First (1LD) or Third (3LD) Life Directives (i.e. before/after July 1994) should be taken into account to correctly assess the report's findings. a) Lack of knowledge and/or weak monitoring " The scrutiny reports on Equitable's regulatory returns from the mid to late 1980s were relatively brief, terse documents, normally running to a page or a page and a half. They were prepared by GAD ... The scrutiny reports would record a few headline figures, the amount of new business written, the movement in mathematical reserves and the cover for the required minimum margin (RMM) of assets over liabilities." (Ch.16-1.) The Society's cover for the RMM was clearly a key index ... dropping through the mid to late 1980s, from 8.5x in 1984 to 3.8x in the 1988 returns. In the absence of the correspondence files, it is not possible to say exactly what doubts may have existed over the returns, or how the downwards trend in cover for RMM was regarded, but it would not appear to have been an issue of any great concern to regulators." (Ch.16-3) "There are no DTI correspondence files dealing with Equitable for the period prior to 1991. A group of earlier files was destroyed ... in 1998 while the regulatory return files were still available (1987 and 1988 missing) back to 1981." (Ch.15-46, 47 and 53) "The scrutiny of the 1989 returns was completed on 5 December 1990. The report was only a page ." (Ch.16-14) Pickford (GAD actuary) observed that in 1991 “our remit was mostly concerned with solvency, rather than bonus declarations . Asset share techniques were only just being developed at this time. We did not monitor a company's bonus smoothing process, therefore, focusing instead on compliance with the regulations, especially on the valuation of liabilities and solvency margins ... as a result the system as a whole was open to exploitation by un-regulated decisions on bonus mix ." (Ch.16-53) Lord Penrose comments having discussed " the formulation of the bonus notice in the context of PRE. ... but no-one at GAD or DTI appears to have taken note of the change in format at the time. Neither organisation made it their practice to look at bonus statements. Indeed, the Society's approach to bonuses, which I understand was unique, was not mentioned by the regulators until March 1993." (Ch.16-57) "Line supervisors and senior line supervisors were not equipped by qualification or experience to form an independent view on the significance of such issues." (Ch.16-81) In the analysis of the 1991 returns it went unnoticed that "there appeared to be “little or no margin” in the valuation rates used in 1991. In order to pay the bonuses declared in 1989 and 1991 the company needed to earn 11¼% per annum. In fact the company earned +3% over the two years instead of the required 23%." (Ch.16-83) "GAD was not expected to “give
