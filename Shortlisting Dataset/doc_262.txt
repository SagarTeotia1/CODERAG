WRITTEN QUESTION E-0325/05 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (3 February 2005) Subject: Living conditions of refugees at the EU's eastern border On 5 January 2005, Chechen refugees from Vinin refugee camp near the town of Kalvar in Poland informed the international community about the inhumane conditions in which they are expected to live. Some 150 people, including a number of cancer patients, are living in the camp. Three or four families have to share a single room. The quality of the food provided is abysmal (it is literally rotten). Doctors visit only occasionally. Diseases are controlled only by means of painkillers and not with the aid of any other medicine. Health care is totally inadequate. The refugees have no money to pay for medical treatment themselves. No child care is provided and children do not go to school. 1. Is the Commission aware of the above situation and of similar ones at other refugee camps in the Member States along the EU's eastern border? 2. Will the Commission contact the appropriate authority in Poland to demand that the inhumane conditions in which these refugees are living be remedied? 3. What has the Commission done to guarantee humane living conditions for refugees?
