Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2011) 1. The programme for territorial development (POVT) for the current programming period 2007‑13, provides for a contribution from the Cohesion Fund to financing the high-speed rail link between Porto and Vigo. According to the latest information available, the Portuguese authorities have decided to postpone the project until the next programming period. The Commission is still waiting for a formal proposal from the Portuguese authorities in this respect. However, rail infrastructure is also eligible for financing under the European Regional Development Fund programme for the North region in Portugal in the current period. Priority 4 (‘Improving the urban system’) includes the promotion of rail infrastructure with the aim of promoting the regional connectivity of the urban system and in particular the ‘promotion of a number of actions/projects that contribute to improving structural connectivity, mobility, security and capillary of the road/rail networks for inter-urban connections’. As the Honourable Member is aware, under the subsidiarity principle, all cohesion policy programmes are administered under shared management and therefore the Member States are responsible for the implementation of the programmes, including setting the objectives and the selection of operations. The Commission would therefore suggest that the Honourable Member contacts directly the Portuguese authorities in charge of managing the programmes concerned, namely: Gabinete de Gestão do Programa Operacional ‘Regional do Norte’ 2007‑13 Rua Rainha D.

It is too early to speculate on funding possibilities for the next programming period after 2013.
