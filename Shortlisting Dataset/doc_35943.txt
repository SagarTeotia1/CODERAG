Question for written answer E-007637/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (2 August 2011) Subject: The aetiology of the recent E. coli outbreak in Germany, and the long-term medical implications of overuse of antibiotics in farming It is reported that the virulent 0104:H4 strain of the bacterium E. coli was implicated in the recent food poisoning outbreak in Northern Germany which resulted in a number of fatalities and hundreds of hospitalisations. It has also been reported that there is concern among scientists that the strain appears to have developed resistance to most antibiotics. Can the Commission confirm the veracity of these reports, and has it any information from either the German Government or the German scientists involved in the initial investigation which would suggest that the vegetables at the centre of the outbreak had been sprayed with water that had been contaminated by sewage or animal slurry after flooding of the local river systems? Can the Commission also indicate whether it has funded any microbiological research to establish the extent to which bacteria, including E. coli, are becoming resistant to antibiotics as a result of their widespread overuse in farming, particularly in the USA, where it is routine to use antibiotics as an aid to weight-gain in farm animals? Finally, can the Commission indicate whether any of the antibiotics used in US farming are currently illegal in the EU, and, if so, whether it has attempted to prohibit the importation of animal products from the USA, or any other country, on this basis within the last two years? If the Commission has failed to seek the prohibition of such imports, does it believe that it is being constrained by WTO regulations?
