WRITTEN QUESTION E-3227/06 by José Ribeiro e Castro (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (14 July 2006) Subject: Cuba — International Red Cross Committee inspections Between 1960 and 2006 only a single visit to Cuba's prisons has been authorised for the International Red Cross Committee (IRCC). The last time the IRCC was able to carry out such an inspection was in 1989, at a time when the international community was exerting strong pressure on the Cuban regime over human rights issues. Despite the absence of any IRCC inspection in the last 17 years, not to mention the lack over the last 18 years of any visit or inspection by a representative of the UN Commission for Human Rights, Cuba has been admitted to the recently created UN Council for Human Rights. Between 1960 and 1989, the Cuban Government systematically rejected all requests from the IRCC to visit its prisons. After the 1989 visit, which identified the existence of 257 political prisoners, the same intolerance persisted on Cuba's part. Can the Commission state: — whether it is aware of these circumstances and what its opinion is on the matter; — whether it is willing to call on the Cuban authorities to accept an urgent visit by the IRCC to Cuba's prisons; — whether it is willing to contact the IRCC and support it in any inspection that takes place?
