Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (5 May 2010) 1. The biophysical criteria have been developed by an expert panel, in the leadership of the Commission's DG Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy. The panel consisted of the top soil, climate and land evaluation specialists whose expertise and reputation guaranteed a scientifically justified proposal. Moreover, their work was peer-reviewed. To answer the Honourable Member's question, the expert panel was not staffed by an expert or an institution from Portugal. Nevertheless, the Commission is opened to receive and consider any additional information from national authorities that would complement the proposed criteria, their thresholds or the methods of their measuring. 2. The Commission published the scientific booklet on the website of DG JRC; it can be accessed at the following website: http://agrienv.jrc.ec.europa.eu/activities/Common%20Criteria%20Fact%20sheets.pdf. This booklet contains a detailed description of scientific methods used for each criterion, and justification of choice of criteria and methods, including an exhaustive list of references. 3. Member States test the biophysical criteria according to the Guidelines which are available at the following website: http://agrienv.jrc.ec.europa.eu/activities/Guidlines%20090430.pdf. The Commission has received reports with simulations from a majority of Member States, and these reports are being analyzed and technical consultations are being held. Portugal delivered its report on 22 January 2010. At the moment, the Commission carries out an analysis of the simulations. This includes discussions with Portuguese authorities in order to clarify technical questions.
