WRITTEN QUESTION E-1761/05 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (19 May 2005) Subject: EU-US agreement on rice imports Considerable concern is being aroused by the agreement between the EU and the US on new rules governing tariffs on imports of husked rice from the US. Well-informed entrepreneurs and operators in the sector have expressed open disagreement and deep perplexity concerning the terms of the agreement, arguing that it has been negotiated from a position of weakness (a view also expressed by the professional associations in the Italian province of Vercelli), as regards both the reduction of tariffs and the reference quantity ( 431678 tonnes, to be increased by 6000 for the next marketing year). It is felt that the primary interests of European agriculture should not be subordinated to those of the US. Can the Commission state whether appropriate measures have been agreed with the other countries affected with a view to supporting rice cultivation in the EU?
