Question for written answer E-005411/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 George Sabin Cutaş (S&D) (7 June 2011) Subject: Reform of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) The Commission recently proposed a raft of measures for the reform of the generalised system of trade preferences, recommending that the number of countries eligible for this special treatment should be reduced from 176 to 80. It also supports an adjustment and consolidation of the Generalised System of Preferences scheme (GSP +), under which trade preferences are granted where there is respect for democracy, human rights and workers’ rights, and for international environmental standards. The European press has reported that Brazil, which is one of the countries that will no longer enjoy trade preferences owing to the growth in its GDP, has expressed its disagreement with the GSP reform, claiming that the Commission’s proposal will lead to a loss of jobs in the shoe industry, which grew in the past thanks to the trade preferences granted to Brazil. What is the Commission's response to the criticisms made not only by Brazil, but also by other countries that benefitted from trade preferences and which, following the new reform, will no longer be eligible for the GSP? Has the Commission considered a plan B to help States that will no longer be granted trade preferences?
