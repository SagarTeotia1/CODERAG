Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (1 July 2011) The 2050 Low Carbon Economy Roadmap (COM(2011)112 final) indicates that a 25 % emissions reduction by 2020 is part of a long term cost-effective pathway. It further clarifies that if the EU delivers on its current policies, including its commitment to reach 20 % renewables and achieve 20 % energy efficiency by 2020, this would enable the EU to outperform the current 20 % emission reduction target and achieve a 25 % reduction by 2020. The Commission indicated both in the 2050 Low Carbon Economy Roadmap as well as in the proposal for a directive on energy efficiency (COM(2011)370 final) that in the implementation of the 20 % efficiency target, it will have to monitor the impact of new measures on the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in order to maintain the incentives in the ETS for rewarding low carbon investments and preparing the ETS sectors for the innovations needed in the future. In this respect appropriate measures need to be considered, including recalibrating the ETS by setting aside a corresponding number of allowances from the part to be auctioned during the period 2013 to 2020, should a corresponding political decision be taken. This would also ensure that the contribution to the energy efficiency target would be made in a cost efficient manner in both, the ETS and non-ETS sectors.
