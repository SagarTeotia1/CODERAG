WRITTEN QUESTION E-1526/04 by Ria Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Automatic external defibrillators The automatic external defibrillator (AED) is a small device which is used to administer an electric shock as quickly as possible in order to restore a normal heart rhythm in victims of sudden cardiac arrest. In Europe, more than 300000 people die of acute cardiac arrest every year. The mean survival rate for acute cardiac arrest victims is under 5 %. If an AED is used, this figure can rise to 70 %. In the Netherlands, the Health Council stated in its report of 21 January 2002, ‘Toepassing van de Automatische Uitwendige Defibrillator (AED) in Nederland’ (The use of AEDs in the Netherlands), that the AED was a technological advance which, even in the hands of an untrained user, was so safe that it was desirable to cease to classify AED defibrillation as a procedure reserved for trained personnel. Accordingly, people other than doctors and nurses may use the device, and many municipalities, businesses, sports clubs, etc., in the Netherlands are now equipped with AEDs. 1. Is the Commission aware of the above report by the Netherlands Health Council? 2. Would it be worthwhile if other EU Member States likewise allowed AEDs to be used by people other than doctors and nurses and promoted the availability of AEDs? 3. Will the Commission take steps to ensure that AEDs are also available in the buildings of the European institutions in Brussels (and Luxembourg and Strasbourg)?
