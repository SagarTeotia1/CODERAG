Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2010) The Commission is aware of the report referred to, which is being made available to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency. Pandemrix was authorised by the Commission in 2009 to fight against pandemic influenza H1N1. Following initial information published by the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare on 25 August 2010, on 27 August 2010 the European Commission asked the Committee for an opinion on whether additional measures were necessary to ensure the safe use of Pandemrix Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency. . The Committee was asked if the marketing authorisation should be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn, and if provisional measures were necessary. Based on the data available, the Committee considered that Pandemrix’s benefit-risk balance remained positive and that no provisional measures were necessary at the time. The Committee further requested that several in-depth studies be carried out by the producer with a view to adopting an opinion by July 2011. In addition, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention is financing an independent retrospective study on associations of Pandemrix vaccination and narcolepsy in 9 countries. The results of this study are expected in May 2011 and will be made available to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency. The Committee is looking into the benefit-risk balance of Pandemrix at its February 2011 meeting taking into account the latest information from Finland. Should the Committee adopt an opinion on this centrally authorised vaccine, the Commission will act on this basis.
