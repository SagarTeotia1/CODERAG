WRITTEN QUESTION E-4518/09 by Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) to the Commission (25 September 2009) Subject: Import of products of non-animal origin from non-EU countries There have recently been cases on the southern Italian fruit and vegetable market in which the checks to be carried out on given products, in particular cherries, have been circumvented so as to prevent non-EU companies from being barred or their products from being withdrawn. Until last season cherries from Turkey used to enter southern Italy via the port of Bari, where they would undergo the standard sampling procedures performed by the Port Medical Office and the customs agency. In summer 2008, however, some Turkish goods were found to be tainted with mildew. What happens in such a case is that the first ten cargoes to be shipped by the same firm in the following year have to be tested at the time of their import. To elude checks of this kind, the companies concerned have this year been shipping their products by land; once they have been cleared through customs in Austria or Slovenia, the products find their way back into southern Italy, where they can seriously harm EU consumers. 1. Does the Commission believe that the rules currently in force, Articles 3 and 15 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, can be considered sufficient, given the ease with which it is possible to circumvent the system for importing products of non-animal origin from non-EU countries? 2. As far as Turkish accession to the EU is concerned, what practical measures are being taken, in the light of the facts described above, to bring the Turkish fruit and vegetable market into line with European standards?
