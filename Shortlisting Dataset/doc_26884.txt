Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (31 October 2006) The Commission has strongly condemned all terrorist attacks recently committed in India. As agreed in the EU‑India Joint Action Plan adopted in September 2005, both sides are committed to reinforcing bilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism. The last round of bilateral consultations on counter-terrorism took place in December 2005 and it is expected that the next round of talks will take place before the end of 2006, after the recent visit of the EU Coordinator on Terrorism, Gijs De Vries, to India.
