WRITTEN QUESTION E-1451/09 by Marco Cappato (ALDE) and Marco Pannella (ALDE) to the Commission (6 March 2009) Subject: Italian prison conditions and a European Prisons Charter Recent figures published by DAP (the Italian Prisons Service) show that fully 51 % of prisoners in Italy are awaiting trial. The Campania region has the largest number at 4 351, and the region's Poggioreale prison holds the national and European record for overcrowding, with 2 544 prisoners, 2 200 of whom are awaiting trial. In addition to the problem of overcrowding Poggioreale is short of prison wardens, resulting in a minimum movement system, with the prisoners almost always locked in their cells. In September 2008 a delegation from the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a Council of Europe body, made a brief visit to Poggioreale to interview some of the newly arrived prisoners awaiting trial. The CPT report, however, has yet to be published on the organisation's website. Given the above, could the Commission clarify: 1. Whether it intends to urge the Committee for the Prevention of Torture to carry out inspections in those Member State prisons where grim conditions have been reported that violate the fundamental human rights of prisoners, such as at the Poggioreale prison in Naples? 2. What initiatives it has taken in order to promote the adoption of a framework decision on prisoners' rights? 3. What is the current state of play regarding a European Prisons Charter covering all the Council of Europe's member countries (Council of Europe Recommendations 1656 and 1747) and what efforts has the Commission made heretofore in order to encourage the drawing up of such a charter?
