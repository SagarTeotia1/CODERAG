Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (28 May 2010) 1. The Commission does not envisage any such measures at EU level. 2. The Commission is not aware of the criteria used by the Romanian authorities to determine the term ‘unhealthy food products’ . There are no harmonised EU provisions for such a tax, and it naturally follows that similarly there are currently no provisions regarding what should or should not be deemed as unhealthy for the purposes of such a tax. 3. However, Member States are free to apply national taxes on such products so long as those taxes do not give rise to formalities connected with the crossing of frontiers between Member States (Article 2(3) of Directive 2008/118/EEC Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, OJ L 9, 14.1.2009. ). In addition any Member State implementing such a tax is obliged to ensure that the effects are compatible with all provisions of European law, including the rules on the free movement of goods and ensuring non-discrimination in taxation that are designed to prevent distortions in the market (Articles 34-36 and 110, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). The Commission is working closely with Member States and with stakeholders for the reformulation of food products to improve easy access to healthier products. Of particular note are the commitments of the members of the Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and health http://ec.europa.eu/health/nutrition_physical_activity/platform/index_en.htm .
