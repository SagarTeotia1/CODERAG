WRITTEN QUESTION E-2664/06 by Richard Seeber (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 June 2006) Subject: Cross-border enforcement of speeding fines in Europe Since 1990, a mutual enforcement agreement has existed between Germany and Austria regarding fines for traffic offences (Austrian Federal Law Gazette 1990/526). Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA OJ L 76, 22.3.2005, p. 16 . on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties has been in existence since 24 February 2005 and should be transposed into national law by 2007 at the latest. Currently, Germany does not enforce speeding fines imposed on the basis of radar speed check photographs, citing grounds of public order. In Austria, only the number plate of the vehicle is recorded and, under paragraph 103(2) of the Austrian law on motor vehicles, the owner of the vehicle is required to provide information as to the driver of the vehicle, and the German authorities consider that this requirement to provide information contravenes the principles of a fair hearing enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), in particular the right not to incriminate oneself. Under Austrian law, administrative fines are dealt with by the Independent Administrative Senate, which is defined as an administrative authority not bound by instructions from outside bodies and which fulfils the requirements of a court under the ECHR. 1. Does the framework decision replace the enforcement agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Austria? If so, does it do so entirely or are only certain individual provisions replaced? 2. Is the Austrian Independent Administrative Senate a ‘court having jurisdiction … in criminal matters’ in the meaning of Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA of 24 February 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties? 3. In the Commission’s view, does paragraph 103(2) of the Austrian law on motor vehicles (on ascertaining the identity of the driver) conform to the ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union?
