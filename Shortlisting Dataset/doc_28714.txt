WRITTEN QUESTION E-2798/10 by Lorenzo Fontana (EFD) to the Commission (23 April 2010) Subject: Freedom of religion in Vietnam and the situation of the monks of Bat Nha Last September, 379 Buddhist monks and nuns who were followers of Thich Nhat Hanh were driven out of Bat Nha monastery, in the Vietnamese province of Lam Dong, by a violent crowd. According to information gleaned from various sources, it appears that the incident was probably sparked by certain statements by Thich Nhat Hanh which displeased the local authorities. In 2010, Vietnam will assume the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The ASEAN Charter, which entered into force in 2008, places particular emphasis on respect for democratic values, human rights, the promotion of peace, regional identity and fundamental freedoms. The opening of negotiations on 2 March 2010 between the European Union Trade Commissioner, Karel De Gucht, and Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung was a clear sign of the EU's increasingly close relations with Vietnam. In view of the foregoing, 1. Since it is difficult to obtain information about the abovementioned incident because of the restrictions imposed by censorship, does the Commission intend to ask the Vietnamese Government for information about the current situation of the Buddhist monks and nuns who were subjected to violence? 2. If it transpires that the Government bears any responsibility for outbreaks of religious intolerance of this kind, does the Commission intend to draw the attention of the local authorities, through the EU Delegation in Vietnam, to the need to ensure that religious freedom is upheld?
