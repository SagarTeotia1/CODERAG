Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2011) As indicated in the Commission reply to parliamentary Question E 5191/2011, in the framework of the 2011 annual programme for the External Borders Fund (EBF), Greece had requested a co-financing of EUR 4.9 million for the construction of a 10.5 km long fence at the land border with Turkey in the Evros region. In the context of the discussions with the Greek authorities on the proposed EBF annual programme, the Commission informed Greece that it would not support the construction of the fence with EU funding as, in its view, this action would not provide in itself a solution to irregular migration in the region. At the same time, the Commission confirmed its readiness to co-finance other more effective measures within the comprehensive strategy that the Greek authorities are planning to establish in order to ensure an integrated border management system along the entire 200 km land border with Turkey. The Commission also encouraged the development of actions within the EBF annual programme aimed at addressing other priorities for the effective management of external borders, such as the recommendations of the Schengen evaluation committee as reflected in the National Action Plan ‘Greece-Schengen’, the implementation of the Greek Action Plan on Asylum and Migration and the completion of the national components of the SIS II and VIS.
