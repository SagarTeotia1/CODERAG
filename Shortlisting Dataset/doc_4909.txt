Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (27 February 2008) In autumn 2006, the EU‑25 Member States submitted their integrated strategic reports for 2006‑08, providing for the first time in one document an analysis of the current situation, the definition of a limited number of key priorities and an outline of strategies across the three strands of the open method of coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion, i.e. social inclusion, pension reform, and healthcare and long-term care The 2006-08 national strategic reports, including that of Bulgaria, is available on: http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/strategy_reports_en.htm . Bulgaria, then an acceding country, was not obliged to submit a national strategic report but nevertheless chose to do so. The Commission and the Council presented their joint assessment of the Member States’ strategic reports, which reflected Bulgaria’s contribution, as part of the 2007 joint report on social protection and social inclusion See: http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/joint_reports_en.htm . In addition, Bulgaria was also subject to a separate country–specific assessment Available in BG and EN, see footnote 3. . With a view to concentrating efforts at both national and European levels and recognising that the OMC deals with structural, long-term issues, the Commission and Member States agreed that reporting in 2007 would be on voluntary basis. Bulgaria belongs to the majority of Member States which chose not to deliver any update Received updates are available on: http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/spsi/strategy_reports_en.htm . During this period, the Commission and Member States agreed to work on selected themes. The 2008 joint report, whose draft was adopted by the Commission on 30 January 2008, concentrates on the selected themes, including child poverty and health inequalities.
