Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (19 April 2002) The Commission is aware of the seriously polluted state of Lough Sheelin. It is one of a number of Irish lakes suffering from eutrophication (i.e. nutrient enrichment, principally due to the substance phosphorus). On 28 July 2000, the Commission notified a Reasoned Opinion to Ireland Procedure A 1990/5220. with regard to the Community's Dangerous Substances Directive Council Directive 76/464/EEC of 4 May 1976 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community, OJ L 129, 18.5.1976 . , which provides for pollution reduction programmes for phosphorus. It cited Lough Sheelin as an example of a water body where there had been a failure to achieve phosphorus reduction. Since then, the Irish authorities have adopted further measures, including agricultural bye-laws. It may also be mentioned that, in 2001, the Commission submitted a case against Ireland before the European Court of Justice Case C-396/01. for inadequate implementation of the Community's Nitrates Directive Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources, OJ L 375, 31.12.1991 . , which requires measures to manage animal manures to the extent that they contribute to problems of nitrate pollution. Since then, there are indications that Ireland is contemplating a country-wide application of this Directive. By requiring tighter controls on the use of manures, such an application should have benefits for lakes such as Lough Sheelin.
