WRITTEN QUESTION E-4928/09 by Kriton Arsenis (S-D) to the Commission (13 October 2009) Subject: Continued pollution of the Gulf of Corinth by mineral waste Recent findings by the Greek Marine Research Centre concerning the Gulf of Corinth reveal an accumulation of dangerous pollutants, in particular sulphur, lead, fluorine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soil and in marine sediment. This is ascribed to an alumina and aluminium plant which has been operating there for many years. In its previous reply ( E-5948/08 ) the Commission indicated that it would investigate measures taken under Directive 2008/1/EC OJ L 24, 29.1.2008, p. 8 . concerning integrated pollution prevention and control and under the Directive on the management of waste from extractive industries in respect of this plant and, if necessary, would initiate infringement proceedings. From the Commission's findings, what measures have been taken in implementation of the above directives and, in general, for the protection of surface and groundwater in the Gulf of Corinth?
