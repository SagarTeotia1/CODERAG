BUDG Future settlement of the institutional aspects of Regulatory Agencies At its meeting of 15-16 July, the Committee on Budgets will vote on its opinion to the AFCO own initiative report on a strategy for the future settlement of the institutional aspects of Regulatory Agencies. The resulting resolution will constitute the first response of Parliament to the C ommission´s communication "European Agencies - The way forward", which intends to re-launch a debate on the role of decentralised agencies and their place in the governance of the EU. There are currently 29 decentralised agencies employ ing some 3 800 staff, with a Community contribution of around € 559 million. Because of the need for a common approach, t he Commission has now invited Parliament and Council to join it in a dialogue on the place of agencies in European governance proposing the establishment of an inter-institutional working group which would allow the key issues facing agencies to be set out as ground rules to apply to all. 20080709CAN33892
