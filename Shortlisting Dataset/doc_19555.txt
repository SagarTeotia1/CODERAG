Question for written answer E-000604/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (3 February 2011) Subject: Antimicrobial resistance According to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Protection and Control (ECDPC), Portugal is one of the European countries with higher antimicrobial resistance rates and one of the nine countries where the rates show a continuing upward trend. As far as Portugal itself is concerned, the Director-General of Health has said that he is worried about the extent of antimicrobial resistance. The Directorate-General for Health also points out that thousands of patients in Europe contract multiresistant infections, a fact which poses a serious public health problem. Does the Commission have figures on the rates of resistance in the Member States? Is there any strategy in place to reduce the complications in terms of public health?
