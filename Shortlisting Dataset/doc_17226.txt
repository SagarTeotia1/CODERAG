Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (17 November 2009) The issues raised by the Honourable Member should be addressed in the River Basin Management Plans developed under the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which Member States are requested to develop by 22 December 2009 and which must be reported to the Commission by 22 March 2010. The River Basin Management Plans, are required to include a map of the monitoring networks as well as the results of the monitoring programmes (in accordance with paragraph 4 of part A of Annex VII WFD), as well as information on the ecological status of the lakes mentioned. The Commission will check the complaince of these reports with the requirements of the directive, and then publish an implementation report in accordance with Article 18.2 of the WFD by 22 December 2012. In the case of a failure of a Member State to submit reports by the deadline, the Commission will also take the necessary steps to ensure compliance as soon as possible. As regards Article 8 of Directive 2000/60/EC, Member States were obliged to establish monitoring networks and report them to the Commission by 22 March 2007. The Commission opened a Case N° 2007/2490 against Greece in 2007 for failing to report monitoring networks, but has recently received information, which is currently being assessed for compliance. Member States are expected to report the results of the monitoring in their River Basin Management Plans. It will not be possible to determine compliance until the river basin management plans are submitted and assessed. As regards Article 5, the Commission issued a first implementation report in March 2007 Communication (COM(2007)128 final) ‘Towards Sustainable Water Management in the European Union’ and Commission Staff Working Document (SEC(2007)362 final): ‘First report on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC’. on the implementation of Articles 3 and 5 and on the transposition of the directive. At that stage no substantial Article 5 report had been received from Greece, and the Commission therefore opened an infringement CaseN° 2005/2317, which was subsequently closed in 2008 after receipt of the report.
