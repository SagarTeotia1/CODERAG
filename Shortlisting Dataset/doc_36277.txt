Question for written answer E-002298/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (14 March 2011) Subject: Concerning Directive 2005/71/EC and brain drain from the Euro-Mediterranean higher education and research area Recital 5 of Council Directive 2005/71/EC of 12 October 2005 on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research states that ‘implementation of this directive should not encourage a brain drain from emerging or developing countries. Back-up measures to support researchers’ reintegration into their countries of origin as well as the movement of researchers should be taken in partnership with the countries of origin with a view to establishing a comprehensive migration policy'. In view of the popular revolts which have recently taken place in several partner countries of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), largely instigated by young people who are not only educated but in most cases have completed higher education, the EuroMed Permanent University Forum (EPUF), a Belgian-registered NGO which brings together over 130 higher education and research bodies in 28 UfM countries, has noted that on returning to their countries of origin students often find there is no adequate structural framework within which they can develop their intellectual activities. What complementary measures has the EU carried out or considered implementing for the creation of such essential structures in third countries, in order to prevent brain drain in UfM partner countries and encourage stability in the region? Has the Commission studied the influence which could potentially be exerted by the EU at institutional and structural level in non-Community UfM partner countries, with special reference to higher education and research and their attendant structures?
