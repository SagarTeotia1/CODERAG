WRITTEN QUESTION E-1582/07 by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE) to the Commission (26 March 2007) Subject: Driving bans in Europe The proliferation of driving bans is an obstacle to an efficient transport market which functions optimally. In a previous answer to my question about this (P‑1767/06), the Commission stated that it had not changed its mind about the added value of a measure to establish a transparent system of driving restrictions. The proposal had only been withdrawn because the Council did not regard it as a priority. The Commission also stated that it would monitor the situation in the road transport market vigilantly and would not fail to take action in the future. In connection with the Lisbon Agenda too, the emphasis is on efficient and effective logistics in the EU. This does not accord with existing practice, which is marked by a proliferation of driving bans. Planning, organisation and delivery schedules constantly have to be revised. A striking consequence of this is that more trucks are needed, which does not benefit the environment. The proliferation is undesirable from the social point of view, too. International drivers are confronted with long compulsory waiting times, often at borders, which puts enormous pressure on the parking capacity available there and on associated facilities. At a meeting of Parliament's Committee on Transport on 23 January this year, Germany's Minister of Transport, Mr Tiefensee, unmistakably held out the prospect that the debate about driving bans could be reopened. 1. Has the Commission taken advantage of this opportunity to reopen the debate on the proliferation of driving bans? If not, why not? 2. In view of the above facts, will the Commission (again) set about drafting a proposal on ‘harmonised rules for restrictions on driving bans’? If not, why not?
