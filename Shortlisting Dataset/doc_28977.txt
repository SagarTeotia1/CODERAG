ORAL QUESTION H-0693/05 for Question Time at the part-session in September II 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jonas Sjöstedt to the Commission Subject: Fisheries agreement with Morocco Since the mid-1980s, the EU has had a fisheries agreement with Morocco, including Western Sahara which has one of the world's richest fishing grounds. The United Nations, among others, defines Western Sahara as the last colony in Africa. The exploitation of Western Sahara's natural resources by Moroccan and other foreign companies can, therefore, be seen as illegal. On 28 July 2005, the EU signed a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, which will also cover the territory of Western Sahara. This differs, for example, from the USA, which has excluded from its free trade agreement with Morocco all products originating from Western Sahara. In the light of this situation, and if the Commission shares the view that Western Sahara is the last colony in Africa, is it justifiable to include Western Sahara in the agreement with Morocco?
