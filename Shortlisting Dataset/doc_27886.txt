ORAL QUESTION H-0253/06 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Zbigniew Kuźmiuk to the Commission Subject: Situation of the soft fruit market in Poland The third soft fruit harvest since Poland joined the European Union is now approaching. Despite the fact that, from the very outset, Polish Members of the European Parliament have been drawing attention to the very difficult situation in the soft fruit market, the Commission has not so far proposed any measures to improve the situation. On 11 May 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables, in which it urged the Commission to provide greater support for producers' organisations and introduce import restrictions in the soft fruit market. The Commission did not take these measures in 2005 and there are no indications that it will do so in 2006. In the light of the above, is the soft fruit market in Poland heading for a crisis for the third time?
