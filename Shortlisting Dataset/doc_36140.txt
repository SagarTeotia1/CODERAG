WRITTEN QUESTION E-2666/07 by Karl von Wogau (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (24 May 2007) Subject: Language requirements in cross-border trade in ready-mix concrete In the Franco-German border region on the Upper Rhine, ready-mix concrete is transported between the two Member States. When ready-mix concrete is transported from Germany to France, there has to be a delivery note in French. Loads transported from France to Germany are often accompanied only by a French delivery note. This unequal treatment, which involves greater administrative effort with correspondingly higher costs for German firms, is seen by German concrete manufacturers as a disadvantage in cross-border competition. Is the European Commission aware of this state of affairs? Does the Commission also see this as a competitive disadvantage for German suppliers in cross‑border trade?
