protection laws. The OFT, which is also responsible for consumer protection, appears to have used this regulation successfully to seek an injunction against companies in Belgium and in the Netherlands which were found to be sending out unsolicited and misleading offers to British consumers. Although a positive step in the right direction, this case did not concern misleading business directories. Other than this case there is little evidence that Regulation 2006/2004 OJ L 364, 9.12.2004, , p.1-11. has been sufficiently used by national authorities to seek a remedy, such as an injunction, for complaints which owe their origin in other Member States. This is appears to be due to the cost of bringing action, to the complexity and the length of procedures and to the limited scope of the injunction. The need to strengthen national authorities The report urges Member States to ensure that businesses who are victims of misleading advertising have a clearly identifiable national authority with which they can make a complaint and seek a remedy. Currently, this is often not the case since national consumer protection authorities often do not cater for complaints from businesses, limiting themselves to complaints from consumers. The report also calls on the European Commission to develop best-practice guidelines for national enforcement agencies which may be followed when cases of misleading advertising are brought to their attention. Misleading business-directories based in third countries Finally, the report calls on the Commission to pursue international co-operation with third countries and with the competent international organisations so that misleading business directories based in third countries do not cause prejudice to businesses based in the European Union. 7.10.2008 OPINION of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for the Committee on Petitions on the Misleading Directory Companies Report (Petition 45/2006) ( 2008/2126(INI) ) Draftswoman: Diana Wallis SUGGESTIONS The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection calls on the Committee on Petitions, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: - having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the provisions thereof establishing the internal market and guaranteeing undertakings the freedom to provide services in other Member States, - having regard to the Presidency Conclusions of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union, which state that individuals and businesses should not be prevented or discouraged from exercising their rights by the incompatibility or complexity of legal and administrative systems in the Member States, - having regard to the 393 petitions on misleading directory companies from 24 Member States and 19 third countries received by its Committee on Petitions, A. whereas the dubious activities of the European City Guides company (ECG) and other, similar companies stretch back over a number of decades (with the companies concerned relocating over time in order to continue their activities and avoid penalties), and whereas many businesses have been affected, B whereas the activities of ECG have been the subject of legal and administrative
