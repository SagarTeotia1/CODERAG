Question for written answer E-5511/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Laurence J.A.J. Stassen (NI) (14 July 2010) Subject: Data roaming charges As from 1 July 2010, mobile telephony service providers are required to cut customers off if they exceed an automatically established limit of EUR 50 in data roaming charges, unless the customer has issued an instruction to the contrary. In spite of this measure, customers are still paying high charges for data roaming. 1. Can the Commission explain how the maximum rates for data roaming were established and why these specific amounts — EUR 0.80 per megabyte from 1 July 2010 and EUR 0.50 from July 2011 — were taken as the ceiling? 2. Does the Commission agree that the high rates which many service providers charge for data roaming are due to the costs that providers charge to one another and then pass on to the consumer? If not, why not? 3. How will the Commission ensure that the disparities between roaming and domestic charges are soon completely eliminated?
