P5_TA(2003)0530 Defence of privileges and immunities of Mr Cappato A5-0433/2003 European Parliament decision on the request for the defence of privileges and immunities made by Marco Cappato (2003/2142(IMM)) The European Parliament, − having regard to a request for the defence of privileges and immunities in connection with a seizure of documents and other items made by an investigating judge of a French Tribunal de Grande Instance in connection with criminal proceedings brought against third parties, submitted by Marco Cappato on 11 June 2003 and announced in plenary sitting on 3 July 2003, − having regard to Articles 9 and 10 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities of 8 April 1965, and to Article 4(2) of the Act concerning the Election of Representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage of 20 September 1976, − having regard to the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 12 May 1964 and 10 July 1986 See Case 101/63: Wagner v. Fohrmann and Krier [1964] ECR, English special edition, 195 and Case 149/85: Wybot v Faure [1986] ECR 2391. , − having regard to Article 26 of the Constitution of the French Republic and Article 80 of the Rules of Procedure of the Assemblée Nationale, − having regard to Rules 6 and 6a of its Rules of Procedure, − having regard to the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ( A5-0433/2003 ), A. whereas Mr Cappato complains in essence that a French investigating judge refused to restitute certain documents and items belonging to him that were seized at the premises of a third party on the ground that they were needed for the pending judicial investigation and required as evidence, B. whereas, since Mr Cappato was elected in Italy, Article 10(b) of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, which provides that MEPs enjoy in the territory of any other Member State immunity from any measure of detention and from legal proceedings, is the only provision of the Protocol which might apply, given that it is not claimed that the documents and articles seized constitute opinions expressed in the performance of the Member's duties, C. whereas it is not without relevance in this context that Article 26 of the Constitution of the French Republic covers only arrest, detention, measures constituting deprivation or restriction of liberty or proceedings brought against a Member of Parliament; whereas, under Article 80(8) of the Rules of Procedure of the French Assemblée Générale, the Assembly can only decide that detention or all or part of the measures in question may be suspended, D. whereas the legal proceedings in connection with which Mr Cappato's request has been made were brought against third parties, E. whereas, in certain circumstances, bringing proceedings against third parties could constitute a breach of a Member's privileges and immunities, F. whereas, however, fumus persecutionis does not appear to be present in this case, 1. Decides not to defend the privileges and immunities of Marco Cappato.
