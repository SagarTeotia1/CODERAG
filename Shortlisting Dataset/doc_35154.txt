Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2012) The Commission closely monitors the situation of furan in foodstuffs. Since 2007 a Commission recommendation is in place that asks the Member States to monitor each year the presence of furan in foodstuffs that have undergone heat treatment (Commission Recommendation 2007/196/EC OJ L 88, 29.3.2007, p. 56 . ). This includes analyses of coffee and canned baby foods. The Member States report these results directly to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which prepares an annual report on the findings. The Commission considers requesting an updated scientific risk assessment on furan from EFSA. Nevertheless, sufficient information on the toxicity of furan is still lacking and research on the toxicity of furan is currently still ongoing. It will therefore depend on the availability of first results from the currently ongoing toxicological studies on furan whether a request for a risk assessment is appropriate at the current moment.
