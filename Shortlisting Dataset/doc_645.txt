WRITTEN QUESTION E-3267/08 by Rosa Miguélez Ramos (PSE) to the Commission (11 June 2008) Subject: Community measures in support of the fisheries sector On 8 March 2006, the Commission adopted a Communication (COM(2006)0103) to improve the economic situation in the fishing industry, which was in difficulties due to the rise in fuel prices; this authorised the Member States to grant national aid to refloat undertakings which were on the verge of bankruptcy. Particularly severely hit by economic problems then and now are trawler-type boats and boats fishing for deep-sea species, which consume more fuel. In order to overcome these problems, the Commission put forward short-term measures, such as de minimis aid, and other, longer-term measures, which included intervention by the new European Fisheries Fund (EFF). In the face of the fresh crisis as a result of rising fuel prices, and in view of the need to avoid any kind of discrimination between the fishermen of the various Member States, it is imperative that the Commission take action which will have a uniform effect throughout the Community fishing industry. What can the Commission specifically do, with funding from the new EFF, to support the trawler and deep-sea section of the fishing industry, which is the most severely and directly affected by the rise in fuel prices?
