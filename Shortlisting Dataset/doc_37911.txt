Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2011) The Commission recalls that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the main responsibility for employment policy and measures to support job creation lies with the Member States. However, the Commission would like to recall that the Europe 2020 strategy creates a common framework, within which the Portuguese Government is invited to put forward and implement measures for mobilising labour market potential and create job opportunities. At the same time, Portugal benefits from support provided by EU structural funds and in particular the European Social Fund (ESF). In the current programming period 2007‑13 of structural interventions in Portugal, EUR 6.1 billion have been foreseen to support job creation under the Operational Programme ‘Human Potential’ which also applies to the region affected by the redundancies by the Delphi factory. The Honourable Member is invited to contact the national authorities who are the responsible for managing and implementing the ESF in Portugal for further details. The Commission would like to stress that industrial change needs to be anticipated and managed in a socially responsible way with a view to mitigating the possible consequences of any restructuring on workers, their families and the regions concerned, in close partnership with all relevant stakeholders, including workers' representatives. Companies have to comply with the national legislation implementing EU Directives which may apply under such circumstances, including Directives on European works councils Directive 2009/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees (Recast), OJ L 122, 16.5.2009, p. 28–44 to be transposed no later than 5 June 2011, recast of Council Directive 94/45/EC on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees of 22 September 1994, OJ L 254, 30.9.1994, p. 64–70 repealed with effect from 6 June 2011. , on collective redundancies Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies, OJ L 225, 12.8.1998, p. 16–21. , on transfers of undertakings Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses, OJ L 82, 22.3.2001, p. 16–20. and establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community, OJ L 80, 23.3.2002, p. 29–33. . The Commission also publishes a monthly monitoring report on the EU employment situation and social outlook and presented in July 2010 a toolkit http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=103&langId=en on good practice in socially responsible restructuring for the use of stakeholders.
