ORAL QUESTION H-0965/06 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Baroness Sarah Ludford to the Commission Subject: GM rice While the Commission decision of October 23rd requiring mandatory testing for GMOs in rice imports is welcome, many aspects of this issue raise deep concern. Since the US authorities have been certifying their rice as free of the unauthorised GMO LLRICE 601, which was nonetheless discovered in shipments, what confidence can EU consumers have in the reliability of such certification systems? UK supermarkets were reportedly selling the GM-contaminated rice imported from the US with the permission of Britain's official food safety watchdog the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Does this inspire confidence in the FSA? How was its stance compatible with EU law? The UK government proposes to allow GM crops to be grown alongside conventional and organic crops. How will the Commission prevent contravention of EU law regarding cross-contamination?
