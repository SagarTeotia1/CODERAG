Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (29 September 2005) At present the Commission does not have sufficient information to determine whether this practice is isolated or reflects a picture of an overall situation in Hungary. The Commission believes that more scientific and technical knowledge may be necessary to better evaluate the issue taking account notably of the possible existence of methods of collecting down which are less prejudicial to the welfare of the birds concerned. Therefore the Commission can confirm that it is in touch with the Hungarian authorities on this issue and will inform the Honourable Member on the outcome of its investigation.
