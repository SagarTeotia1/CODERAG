Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (25 October 2007) In accordance with the Treaty, the Commission has exercised its power of legislative initiative by proposing measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. This approximation has often concerned provisions of private law, for example in the field of consumer contract law. The role and function of European private law is, therefore, to provide for harmonised rules of private law that are applicable in all Member States. The core of European private law is currently represented by the consumer contract law acquis which is based on minimum harmonisation, i.e. harmonisation which allows Member States to adopt more stringent rules to protect consumers. Besides its legislative initiatives in the field of European private law, the Commission has launched a project for establishing a Common Frame of Reference (CFR) in European Contract Law. The CFR is meant to be a toolbox, containing common principles, definitions and model rules of contract law, and it is aimed at ensuring coherence in the European contract law acquis. European private law, as it has emerged through the harmonisation of the rules governing specific fields, for example consumer contract law, does not at the moment require any special structure for its governance. As it clearly stated in its 2004 Communication on European Contract Law and the revision of the acquis, ‘the way forward’ COM(2004)651 final. the Commission has no intention to promote a European Civil Code.
