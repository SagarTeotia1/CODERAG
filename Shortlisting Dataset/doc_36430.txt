ORAL QUESTION H-0074/10 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Catherine Bearder to the Commission Subject: Biodiversity and the subjugation of environmental priorities to commercial interests The re-emergence of the threat to the African elephant highlights the danger of the commodification of some of the earths most rare and endangered species. The threat to this particular animal is symptomatic of the approach of putting economic demands ahead of the need to protect our ecosystem and the host of animal species it is home to. A second example of this can be seen in the form of the recently leaked document from the Commission revealing its intention to reclassify palm plantations as 'forests' in order to permit the use of palm oil as a biofuel. The reclassification of palm oil plantations by the Commission gives carte blanche to the palm oil, logging and paper industries to deforest, to destroy, and to kill. Across the world organisations are fighting for the survival of species being pushed to the brink of extinction because of the aggressive proliferation of such industries. In this, the UN Year of Biodiversity, what additional steps does the Commission intend to take to safeguard the many vulnerable species open to exploitation for commercial gain?
