Question for written answer E-007665/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (3 August 2011) Subject: German programme for an ‘investment and growth initiative’ for Greece According to German press reports, Germany's Economy Minister is preparing a programme, in consultation with the Commission, for an ‘investment and growth initiative’ for Greece. This programme will reportedly include the creation of model regions, which will be subject to a special regime with their own labour laws, a special tax system and special arrangements for businesses — all under the auspices of a government representative, who will be solely at the service of foreign investors. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Is it aware of the existence of this programme? 2. What are its views on the above outline of the programme?
