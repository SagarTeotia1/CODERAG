WRITTEN QUESTION E-1833/09 by Nils Lundgren (IND/DEM) to the Commission (23 March 2009) Subject: New EU requirements concerning open fields How many trees are allowed in a field used for animal pasture? That is a question being asked by an increasing number of farmers and landowners in my home country of Sweden. The reason for the question is that the EU has sent out different messages at short intervals, an inconsistency which is now trying farmers' patience. In 2007, the Swedish Board of Agriculture drew up rules establishing a maximum of 50 trees per hectare in pasture fields. Those rules applied until the end of autumn of 2008 when the EU's auditors announced that new rules had been drawn up. According to the latest rules, the maximum number of trees allowed per hectare in a pasture field is now 60. Does the Commission intend, within the near future, to draw up new rules governing the number of trees allowed in a pasture field? If not, can the Commission then promise Swedish farmers and landowners that the current rules will apply for the foreseeable future?
