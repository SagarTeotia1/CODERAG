Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (22 January 2007) The technical meeting held in Rio de Janeiro on 6 and 7 November 2006 was constructive and useful since it gave the Commission the chance to explore together with Mercosur the working methods for the negotiation process with a view to building a more comprehensive package. This working process will allow us to jointly assess how to best meet the expectations on both sides in order to reach an ambitious and mutually satisfactory outcome. This meeting was devoted to discussions on methodology and did not focus on specific trade topics. It was agreed to meet again at technical level, most likely in the beginning of 2007, to further explore the possibilities for how to move forward in the construction of a comprehensive package. Past experience has shown that the establishment of an agenda with precise deadlines has not been helpful to the negotiations, and the Commission gives priority to substance over timing.
