Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (18 December 2006) The Commission confirms to the Honourable Member that its call for proposals addressed to civil society organisations to support their projects aimed at getting citizens debating on EU issues has been a success. Thus, the Commission received 31 proposals to its call. The Evaluation Committee identified six projects as being the most suitable ones to be retained for possible financial assistance in accordance with the call’s terms of reference. The Commission would like to remind to the Honourable Member that the ‘award criteria’ announced in the call for proposals did mention specifically ‘the diversity of origins and their representativeness’ among the important criteria Award Criteria: Eligible projects will be evaluated on the basis of: (a) the consistency of the overall concept of the project with the objectives of Plan D, as described at point 2 of the call for proposals; (b) the quality of the work programme and the modus operandi; (c) the dynamics of networking and the establishment of pan-European cooperation; (d) the capacity of the project to: (i) act in a large number of Member States, and ideally in all 25; (ii) involve a large number of citizens; (iii) ensure their diversity of origin and their representativeness; (iv) provide for the use of the largest number of national languages possible; (v) generate transnational results; (e) the likely multiplier effect, as calculated on the basis of the measures proposed to give visibility to the project and its outcomes; (f) the system of feedback to European decision-makers, as recommended by Plan D; (g) the mechanism for evaluation of the objectives pursued by the project. for selecting the most suitable projects. The Honourable Member should be assured that being, as described in her question, ‘EU‑sceptical’ or not was definitely not a pre-requisite nor an obstacle for participating in the call for proposals. Finally, the Commission wishes to point out that the management, content and choice of partners and selection of participants are the sole responsibility of the leaders of the projects and that the Commission does not interfere in their decisions. Of course the Commission will monitor the progress of the projects, collect and process their input and ensure their compatibility with the financial procedures of the EU.
