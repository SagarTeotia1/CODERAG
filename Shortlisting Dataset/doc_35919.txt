Question for written answer E-006829/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (13 July 2011) Subject: Food banks: resources The ruling handed down on 13 April 2011 by the Court of Justice, at the request of Germany and Sweden, on the 2009 European Programme of Food Aid for the Most Deprived Persons (PEAD) and, in particular, the annex on the allocation of resources, constitutes a heavy blow for deprived people throughout Europe, and particularly in Spain. The ruling obliges the Commission to limit its aid to available agricultural surpluses, and to forego all and any purchasing of food on the market with the remaining money. As a result, for 2012, the resources allocated to the PEAD programme for the whole of Europe will be merely a quarter of what they were in 2011, i.e. falling from EUR 500 million to less than EUR 130 million. During the Polish Presidency of the Council, a draft regulation is to be put forward on establishing a new PEAD, one which will be more stable and not exclusively subject to available agricultural surpluses, and will thus be able to continue to offer European Union help to those who need it most. Can the Council describe the principal points of the proposal for the new PEAD to be drafted during the next Presidency? What actions will the Council be taking to prevent the interests of the governments of specific Member States putting an end to a programme of essential importance at a time of deep economic crisis like the present?
