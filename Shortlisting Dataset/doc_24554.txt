they are "unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances". Concerning the different points of Draft Amending Budget No 1/2009 your rapporteur has the following comments: 1. Mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund The European Commission proposed on 23 January 2009 a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund, which is based on the provisions of point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 and in Council Regulation No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) of 11 November 2002. It is important to note that the objective of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to contribute to a rapid return to normal living conditions in a region or country in case of natural disasters. It is not foreseen for compensating private damage. It is to note that during the 2008 Budget year the fund was mobilised four times, in favour of respectively the UK (EUR 162.387.985), Greece (EUR 89.769.009), Slovenia (EUR 8.254.203) and Cyprus (EUR 7.605.445). During the Conciliation on 17 July 2008, the European Parliament and Council stated in a Common Declaration that they "welcome the Commission commitment according to which, as from now, every Preliminary Draft Amending Budget required by the mobilisation of the Solidarity fund will be solely for that purpose." This proposal is the third amending budget - since the declaration - that solely takes into consideration the mobilisation of the EUSF. Your rapporteur welcomes the Commission proposal as it is in line with its commitment taken on 17 July 2008. 2. Financing In article 26(1) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of May 2006 the total annual amount of the Solidarity Fund is set at EUR 1 billion. The European Commission proposes to mobilise the fund for a total amount of EUR 11.785.377 in favour of Romania, as the country suffered from very strong floods in July 2008.. The amount of compensation for Romania will leave at least 25% of the EUSF for allocation during the last quarter of the year, as foreseen by Art. 4(2) of the Regulation establishing the EUSF. The Commission proposes to allocate an amount of EUR 11,8 million from budget line 13 03 16 (European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Convergence) to budget line 13 06 01 (EUSF). The credits for the EUSF mobilisation are transferred within budget title 13 - Regional Policy, but will be shifted from Heading 1b (Sustainable growth - Cohesion for growth and employment) to Heading 3b (Citizenship) of the MFF. The Commission declares in its proposal that "the implementation of line13 03 16 will be closely monitored during the budget year". Your rapporteur takes note of the remarks of the letter by the Chairman of the Committee on Regional development to the Chair of the Committee on Budgets of 12 February 2009 in which the specified committee agrees on the Commission's mobilisation proposal. Your rapporteur proposes to accept the proposed Draft Amending Budget 1/2009 unamended.
