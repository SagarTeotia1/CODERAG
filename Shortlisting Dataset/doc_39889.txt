Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) It is correct that Russia presented a draft proposal for an ‘Agreement between the Russian Federation and the European Union for cooperation in implementing infrastructure projects in the field of natural gas export from the Russian Federation to the European Union and for joint operation of power systems’ in 2011 in the context of the EU‑Russia energy dialogue. The Commission has informed EU Member States of the text of that proposal.
