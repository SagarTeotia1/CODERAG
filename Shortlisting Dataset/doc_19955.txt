WRITTEN QUESTION E-0462/07 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) and Elena Valenciano Martínez-Orozco (PSE) to the Commission (8 February 2007) Subject: Guatemala — murder of Pedro Zamora On 15 January 2007, Pedro Zamora, the Secretary-General of the STEPQ dockers’ trade union, was murdered in Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala. Mr Zamora had been pressing for the reinstatement of a group of workers who had been sacked and for the administration at Puerto Quetzal docks to respect workers’ rights. The latest information received by European and Guatemalan workers’ associations shows that violence, death threats and intimidation aimed at union members and those that defend workers’ rights in Guatemala are continuing to worsen. Given the European Union’s guidelines concerning the protection of human rights defenders as adopted by the Council in June 2004, how does the Commission intend to react to the acts of violence and impunity that are continuing signs of the serious human rights situation in Guatemala? How does the Commission intend to support the development of human rights and the protection of human rights defenders in Guatemala during the period between 2007 and 2013? Is the Commission considering calling for workers’ rights of association to be respected and for union leaders to be protected?
