passengers In a report by Dirk Sterckx (ALDE, BE) on minimum rights for rail passengers, the House voted to extend proposals on international passengers' rights and obligations to domestic rail traffic, arguing that "ordinary rail passengers should not be left out in the cold". This demand conflicts with the Council's position. Sterckx said that there was no point in drawing up a regulation which applied only to the 5% rail passengers who use international train services. European citizens should, in the event of problems, be entitled to certain minimum rights. The matters regulated by this proposal include information for passengers, liability in the event of death or injury and assistance to persons with reduced mobility. The House is also in favour of a system of compensation for delays: 25% of the fare for a delay of 60 minutes or more and 50% for a delay of 120 minutes or more, but only if the operator can be held responsible for the delay. Furthermore, rail operators must ensure that stations, platforms and means of transport are accessible, by eliminating all obstacles to boarding, disembarkation and remaining on board. And in future all trains should provide a specially designated area of the train for baby carriages, bicycles and sports equipment. Towards a European licence for train drivers A report on certification of train drivers, drafted by Gilles Savary (PES, FR), was also adopted. Whereas the Council wishes only train drivers to be covered by the directive, Parliament says that other crew members performing safety-related tasks should be in possession of a certificate attesting that they meet minimum requirements relating to medical fitness, basic education and general professional skills. -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070112BRI01902 FULL-TEXT DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070112BRI01902 ITEM-008-EN DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070112BRI01902 ITEM-010-EN DOC XML V0//EN Transport Road safety: European Parliament says more action needed 2007-01-22 - 12:29 In a report produced in response to the Commission's mid-term review of the EU Road Safety Action Programme, the European Parliament is calling for "a higher level of political commitment" to road safety in all Member States and EU institutions. More than 40,000 deaths are caused by road traffic accidents in the European Union, the direct and indirect costs of which are estimated at €180 billion, or 2% of EU GDP. Moreover, the disparity between different Member States' road safety records is widening. The European Parliament report, drawn up by Ewa HEDKVIST PETERSEN (PES, SE) voices disappointment at the lack of progress in reaching the target of halving the number of road fatalities in the EU by 2010. It urges Member States to enforce existing legislation, which MEPs say would greatly improve road safety if it were fully observed by road users. The House makes a number of other recommendations: - an EU-wide zero alcohol limit should be introduced for new drivers as well as for bus drivers and professional commercial drivers involved in the transport of hazardous goods; - the Commission should conduct a study on harmonising road
