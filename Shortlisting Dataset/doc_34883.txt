Question for written answer E-010361/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Vincenzo Iovine (ALDE) (14 December 2010) Subject: Public consultation on possible revision of Directive 2001/37/EC DG Sanco recently opened a public consultation with the consultation document ‘Possible revision of the Tobacco Products Directive 2001/37/EC’ only available in English. The aim of the consultation is to collect comments and observations from EU citizens on the revision of a piece of legislation of particular interest to tobacco producing countries (the EU’s thirteen tobacco producing countries, with Italy at the top of the list and Poland, Bulgaria, Spain and Greece following, currently produce 250 000 tonnes of coarse tobacco per year). According to data from from DG Education and Culture, despite a constant increase in learning of foreign languages, the majority of EU citizens cannot understand English well enough to allow them to consult the aforementioned document. The European Union has three working languages and 23 official languages. Multilingualism forms an integral part of European identity and the EU encourages linguistic and cultural diversity. In view of this, I feel it is vital that all EU languages are promoted by providing citizens with translations of documents intended to seek their opinion in regard to revising EU policy. In view of the Council resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism and bearing in mind that the public consultation in question has been opened with revision of a piece of legislation in mind, can the Commission say: 1. How it intends to resolve the problem arising from the fact many tobacco growers will find it impossible to take part in this initiative? 2. Whether it considers that objectivity in this consultation may be threatened by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon response (i.e. citizens in non-tobacco growing countries)?
