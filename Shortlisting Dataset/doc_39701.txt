at the same time, that such projects should generate direct added value for the local societies in which they are based by activating local stakeholders, facilitating technology transfer and enabling the development of efficient networks and infrastructures that also lend themselves to local use, thus boosting the local economy, contributing to social cohesion and supporting further development in the regions concerned; 7. Underlines the importance of projects in the renewable energy sector that not only contribute to economic development in UfM member countries, especially those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, but also constitute a structural element of cooperation within the UfM; Industrial cooperation 8.
