Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (25 September 2008) 1. On 19 November 2007 Greece communicated to the Commission the transposition measures regarding Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2008 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum‑seekers OJ L 31, 6.2.2003. . Accordingly, on 6 May 2008, the Commission closed the infringement case against Greece concerning this matter. The Commission is in the process of examining whether Greece has correctly transposed the directive. If needed, the Commission will proceed with further procedural steps in accordance with the power conferred to it by Article 226 of the Treaty establishing the European Community in order to ensure that the Member State complies with its obligations under the EU asylum acquis. 2. On 31 January 2008 the Commission referred Greece to the Court of Justice for non-compliance with the Dublin II Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national, OJ L 50, 25.2.2003. and the case is now pending before the Court of Justice. Information about cases pending before the Court is regularly updated on its website: http://curia.europa.eu/. 3. The Commission is aware of the difficulties Greece is confronted with, due in particular to an increase in the number of asylum-seekers as well as of the mixed flows it receives, and it is convinced that a response has to be found at the level of the Union, in a spirit of solidarity. The Commission adopted on 17 June 2008 the Policy Plan on Asylum COM(2008)360 final. , in which it highlighted the need for the Union to continue to intensify its efforts towards better assisting those Member States that have limited reception and absorbtion capacities and who find themselves under particular migratory pressure because of their geographic situation. The Commission considers the establishment of genuine solidarity mechanisms as an essential element in view of creating a coherent, comprehensive and integrated Common European Asylum System. The Commission is committed to continue supporting Greece in its efforts and would highlight that it has already provided Greece with considerable financial support. Between 2000 and 2007, EUR 5 million have been allocated to Greece in the framework of the European Refugee Fund and EUR 1.5 million are available for 2008. Greece can equally benefit from the financial support for emergency actions available under the European Refugee Fund III and the Borders Fund starting in 2008, which will assist Member States in managing the pressure on their asylum systems as well as on their borders.
