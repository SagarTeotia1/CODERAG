Question for written answer E-003247/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jan Březina (PPE) (4 April 2011) Subject: Investigation of publishing companies On Tuesday, 1 March 2011, several publishing companies in Europe were raided by Commission inspectors. The background to these raids is the agency model many big publishers have adopted in order to sell ebooks. Under this model, instead of selling ebooks wholesale and allowing retailers to set the price they charge customers, the publisher itself sets the price and the retailer takes a commission. The potential problem with this arrangement is that it could, according to the Commission statement explaining the raids, ‘violate EU anti-trust rules that prohibit cartels and other restrictive business practices’. If the Commission sees charging a reasonable price for ebooks as illegal, what other option does it see for publishers in terms of economic behaviour?
