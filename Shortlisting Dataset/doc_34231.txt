Joint answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-0219/07 , E-0220/07 , E-0221/07 (9 March 2007) When producing food of animal origin for human consumption, food business operators must comply with the general rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, OJ L 139, 30.4.2004. and those specifically provided for food of animal origin in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, OJ L 139, 30.4.2004. . Specific requirements for fish oil for human consumption have recently been added to this latter regulation by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1662/2006 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1662/2006 of 6 November 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, OJ L 320, 18.11.2006. . According to these requirements, food business operators must ensure that raw materials used to produce fish oil are derived from fishery products found fit for human consumption, come from establishments, including vessels, approved under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and are transported and stored until processing in hygienic conditions. Establishments producing fish oil for human consumption cannot operate and place their products on the market before the competent authorities in all Member States have approved them for this specific purpose. Such an approval should only be granted if full compliance with the abovementioned requirements is noted. A similar approach applies to establishments handling animal by-products (ABP). These establishments, which include those preparing fish oil for purposes other than human consumption, are also subject to approval by the competent authority and cannot operate unless they comply with the relevant requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption, OJ L 273, 10.10.2002. . In particular, once raw materials have been designated as animal by-products, the rules on channelling, storage, identification and use for authorised purposes laid down in the abovementioned regulation must be complied with in order to ensure that oil derived from such materials will not re-enter the food chain and end up in a human consumption destination. Lists of such approved establishments have to be drawn up, updated and made available by the competent authorities in each Member State. However, in order to make these lists widely available and understandable, a centralised access to these lists has been installed on the Commission web pages and a defined presentation format has been agreed between the Commission and the Member States. The presentation format for ABP establishments is to be enforced as of 1 July 2007. With regard to official controls, and according to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of
