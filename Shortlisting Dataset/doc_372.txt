preservation of work for a large part of their staff, but also allowed for a rapid increase in production when demand grew again; F) Whereas, however, less qualified workers and particularly those on short-term contracts were more likely to be dismissed when production was temporarily ceased; G) Whereas at the end of the first half of 2009, the number of employees in the industry was 16,4% lower than in the same period in 2008; H) Whereas it is not clear if really 590 workers will be targeted by the measurs as the total number of workers included in the calculation for assistance is only 583; I) Whereas 75,4% of the redundant workers are women and whereas 71,2% of the workers are between 25 and 54 years old; J) Whereas 87,5% of the dismissed workers are metal, machinery and related trades workers; K) Whereas the Commission argues that the EGF support was also offered to all the workers made redundant; whereas, however, some of them had already found jobs, retired or did not express interest in participating in the measures; whereas the Commission further argues that, additionally, the implementation system of the EGF in Poland requires that workers receiving the assistance must be formally registered as unemployed at the Poviat Labour Offices and whereas, therefore, there might be a small margin of people who do not fall into any of the groups mentioned, as they decided not to register at the Labour Offices and will therefore not participate; Therefore, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to integrate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution concerning the Polish application: 1. Agrees with the Commission that the conditions for a financial contribution under the EGF regulation are met; 2. Notes that the Polish authorities offered the coordinated package of personalised services to all workers but that due to various reasons only a part of the redundant workers eventually participated in the measures; 3. Recalls application EGF/2010/006 PL/H.Cegielski-Poznan that covers 658 redundancies in the same region of one enterprise manufacturing two-stroke diesel engines used for ships and power plants and four of its suppliers; 4. Regrets that, seen the difference in treatment of qualified employees and unqualified personnel with fixed short-term contracts, the application does not indicate the level of education of the redundant workers; 5. Wonders whether the workers do not profit from any general job search assistance; 6. Requests more information about the tailor-made training and retraining measures regarding the objectives of the training, its duration and the nature of the certificates, diplomas and licences that can be obtained; 7. Wonders whether the entrepreneurship promotion and aid for self-employment includes any other than financial support like mentoring or counselling.
