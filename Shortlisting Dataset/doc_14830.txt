and tariffs can be reduced in all industrialised countries; 7. Stresses the importance, also for developing countries, of enhancing market access for service providers, whilst safeguarding the ability of all WTO members to regulate their own service sectors in accordance with the GATS agreement, including the possibility of exempting basic sectors such as health, education and audio-visual services; regrets that no specific framework on services has been established within the WTO negotiations so far, especially in sectors which are of interest for the export possibilities of developing countries; calls for substantial progress in this field; 8. Stresses the importance of commodities such as sugar, bananas and cotton for developing countries; calls upon the European Union to offer developing countries the necessary assistance to reform their sugar sectors; deplores the lack of an effective solution to the cotton problem in Hong Kong; 9. Welcomes the extension of the scope of the "aid-for-trade" programme, which has not been restricted to LDCs but extended to other developing countries; however, deplores the fact that this previously agreed aid has now been made conditional on additional trade concessions from aid recipients; stresses that this aid must be funded with new money and not involve shifting resources already earmarked for other development initiatives, such as the Millennium Development Goals; 10. Takes note of the development package adopted in Hong Kong; regrets that the granting of duty and quota free access for LDC products to developed country markets allows the exclusion of up to 3% of tariff lines which substantially reduces the benefits for LDCs; calls on all developed and advanced developing countries to follow the model of the EU "everything but arms" initiative; 11. Stresses the importance of debt relief by phasing out the debts of LDCs for those governments which respect human rights and the principle of good governance, and give priority to poverty eradication and economic development; 12. Takes note of recent studies by UNCTAD and other institutions that show that the extensive trade liberalisation in LDCs has not been sufficiently translated into sustained and substantial poverty reduction and has contributed to a decline in the terms of trade of developing countries, in particular of African countries; warns against the catastrophic consequences of totally eliminating customs revenue for these countries through the overhasty and forced opening of the market and stresses the right of these countries to determine themselves the speed at which they open their markets in all sectors; 13. Recalls the urgent need for stabilisation of commodity prices and a review of supply management mechanisms on international commodity markets; calls on the Commission to support existing proposals of African WTO members to have action on commodity prices included in the current Round of WTO negotiations; 14. Stresses the importance of capacity-building for trade to enhance the ACP’s ability to identify needs and strategies, of negotiating and supporting regional integration and of assisting in this process, with a view in particular to diversification and to supporting regional integration and preparing for liberalisation by enhancing production and supply and trading capacity and by offsetting adjustment costs
