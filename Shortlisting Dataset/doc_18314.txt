ORAL QUESTION H-0034/07 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Milan Gaľa to the Commission Subject: Preparation of legislation on the use of mercury in the EU On 14 March 2006, the European Parliament adopted a resolution based on the own-initiative report drafted by Marios Matsakis on the Community strategy concerning mercury ( A6-0044/2006 ; 2005/2050(INI); resolution P6_TA(2006)0078 ). Under this strategy, it is proposed that the approved framework of basic principles governing the use of mercury should be completed by the progressive addition of legislative standards covering many areas where mercury is used. How is the Commission proceeding in terms of the preparation of the relevant legislative acts, and does a timetable exist for their submission to the European Parliament? As a stomatologist, I would also like to know what stage has been reached in the preparation of legislation laying down conditions on the use of dental waste and, potentially, imposing restrictions on, or prohibiting, the use of mercury as an ingredient in the amalgam used as a dental filling material in stomatology.
