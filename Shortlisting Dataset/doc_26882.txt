certified the reliability of such implementation; recalls that documents relating to this budget item are published on Parliament's website; 105. Notes that the Secretary-General's proposals firstly for a standard letter for selecting the groups’ external auditors and secondly for the group chairmen's financial reports have been submitted to the Bureau for discussion and adoption; notes that a decision has not yet been taken and calls on the Bureau to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control of the outcome of the discussions; 106. Notes that in 2004, in preparation for applying the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, Parliament made a start on technically merging the management systems for the payment of allowances to Members of Parliament, which, until then, had been running independently of each other (the PAM Project - Portail Applicatif des Membres, or Members' Application Portal); 107. Notes that the Disciplinary Board has completed its work on allocating responsibility in connection with the discrepancy of BEF 4 136 125 between the cash situation and the corresponding accounts in 1982; expects that amount, including interest, to be recovered; 108. Notes with satisfaction that on 12 December 2005 the Bureau adopted the final report by the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) working group and that the report on the environmental management system within Parliament will be posted on Parliament's website in February 2006; 109. Notes that information technology services for Members have been further improved, in particular: – as a result of improved IT facilities for Members' offices; – by the setting up of a CyberLAN network, to which any computer can be connected; – by launching a pilot project on the introduction of an electronic signature system; – through improved measures to protect servers, workstations and network components; – by equipping Parliament with a wireless communications structure (hotspots and wireless fidelity); 110. Insists that electronic signatures, for which a pilot project is now in process, be introduced as soon as possible so that Members can sign documents such as amendments and parliamentary questions without having to forward documents on paper, which would increase the efficiency of Members’ work in Parliament; 111. Notes that the Quaestors decided on 16 November 2005 that committee documents would continue to be made available to committee members, but that hard-copy distribution of texts adopted in Strasbourg and press releases is being discontinued.
