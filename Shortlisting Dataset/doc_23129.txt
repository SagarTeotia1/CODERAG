Question for written answer P-001164/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Francesco Enrico Speroni (EFD) (10 February 2011) Subject: Professional associations and the wearing of court dress by lawyers practising their profession elsewhere than in their home Member State Under Directives 77/249/EEC and 2005/36/EC, a lawyer registered with a professional association in the European Union may practise his or her profession in another Member State. None of the conditions laid down in the above-mentioned directives relates to the wearing of court dress, and the national rules on the subject predate the Union legislation. Does the Commission take the view that, in circumstances where it is obligatory for lawyers to wear a gown, they may wear the gown customarily worn in their home Member State or alternatively they may, on occasion, wear the gown of the Member State in which they are practising, even if they only do so from time to time?
