Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (27 May 2010) The Commission services have put in their work programme for 2010-2012 an action to harmonise national legislation in retrofitting of heavy vehicles. In that sense, the Commission supported the creation of a working group in United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on fixing standards of heavy duty vehicles with diesel particulate traps. This working group was decided in February 2010 at the last UNECE/Group of Rapporteurs on Pollution and Energy (GRPE) meeting as mentioned by the Honourable Member. The imminent harmonisation work envisaged at GRPE only concerns retrofit systems reducing particle emissions, because for this purpose mature technology exists. However, on the request of the Commission the mandate of the informal GRPE sub-group has been extended and will also relate to retrofit systems reducing the emissions of other regulated pollutants and in particular of NO x . This work should be launched during the next years, when a clear view on viable technical solutions can be established. The final objective is to adopt a set of UNECE standards for retrofit systems reducing emissions of several regulated pollutants to the Euro VI levels (e.g. one standard for particle emissions reduction systems, another one for NO x emissions reduction systems, etc.), which would be the reference requirements for Member States. An extension of the proposal to non-road machinery could indeed be envisaged, however the need and benefit of such extension is still subject to a more profound analysis. At this stage, it is difficult for the Commission to provide a concrete timeframe. Nevertheless, the Commission will report to all interested parties on the progress of this file.
