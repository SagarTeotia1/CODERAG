WRITTEN QUESTION E-4035/05 by Amalia Sartori (PPE‑DE) to the Council (3 November 2005) Subject: Management of avian flu risks Avian flu represents a worldwide threat which calls for coordinated, rapid action at European and international level and rigorous application of the rules on hygiene, public health and consumer protection. No Member State acting alone can adopt effective measures to curb the spread of the virus. Will the Council do everything within its power not to underestimate the urgency of the avian flu virus situation and to take appropriate measures to contain the risk of contagion and avoid the possibility of transmission to human beings? Would the Council take all appropriate measures to ensure prompt and proper distribution of vaccine, inter alia by preparing a general plan for managing the crisis? Has the Council assessed carefully whether the states preparing to accede to the European Union have fully incorporated the acquis communautaire in the area of public health and hygiene and consumer protection and, above all, whether European legislation on veterinary controls and animal welfare has been adequately incorporated into national law?
