is essential for a vibrant democracy; confirms, however, that the democratic requirements placed on the Community regulatory process as regards accountability and transparency must also apply to these organisations; 13. Points out that access to legislation is an important part of effective participation and consultation, so that legislation must be both consistent and clear, access thereto must be practical, and there must be better understanding of laws by those concerned; 14. Takes the view that this requires effective publicity and the best possible forms of communication, direct (to members of the public) and indirect (via the press), in order to arouse interest and win the public's support for measures to be taken; 15. Emphasises the opportunity which new technologies present as regards meeting new challenges concerning communication, consultation and the direct participation of civil society; Autonomous regulatory authorities 16. Takes the view, based on the principles set out in paragraphs 8 and 10, that the creation of further independent regulatory authorities in addition to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market in Alicante, the Community Plant Variety Office in Angers and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London within the framework described in the White Paper White Paper 3.2. can be approved if specific scientific or technical expertise is required and a decentralised administration seems appropriate; however, this must not lead to a reduction in expert and judicial scrutiny by the Commission or to any watering down of the Commission's political accountability; 17. Points out, however, that the Commission must always have the necessary instruments to enable it to account to Parliament and the Council for the activities of such authorities and it goes without saying that authorities of this kind can be created only on a clear legal basis; 18. Remains committed to the principle of autonomous enforcement of Community law by national governments and regions, because this leads to a transparent division of tasks, clear accountability and implementation of EU law that is close to the citizen; insists, however, on effective monitoring of compliance with obligations under European law, e.g. by means of Treaty infringement procedures; 19. Points out that the right of codecision and political scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council would become more difficult if EU administrative powers were increasingly delegated to European agencies with decision-making powers; moreover, increasing fragmentation of the 'EU executive' would make the Union less transparent for its citizens; administrative powers must therefore be 'delegated' to agencies only in the case of decisions of a purely technical nature which have no political dimension, scientific support or subject matter that is highly specialised and subject to very detailed regulation; Openness and transparency 20. Takes the view that increased transparency and openness on the part of the Council as legislator is a sine qua non for good governance and that keeping interested parties informed of the Council's legislative work is the basic precondition for improving understanding and increasing participation on the part of the general public; 21. Stresses once again in this connection the need for the Council to
