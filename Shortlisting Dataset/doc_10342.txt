Question for written answer E-000716/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Brian Simpson (S&D) (4 February 2011) Subject: Mandatory weighing of shipping containers Will the Commission consider a directive making it compulsory in all EU ports for all sealed shipping containers to be weighed before being loaded onto ships and before leaving a port by road, similar to the legislation in force in Australia and that being considered by Japan, so that the highly dangerous practice of overloading containers can be effectively put to an end?
