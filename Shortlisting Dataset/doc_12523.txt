2 April 2001 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION further to the Council statement pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure by Francis Wurtz and Herman Schmid on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group on the economic and social aspects of the Stockholm European Council European Parliament resolution on the economic and social aspects of the Stockholm European Council The European Parliament, – having regard to the conclusions of the Stockholm European Council, 1. Considers that, in relation to the stated priorities for the follow-up to Lisbon, the results are limited, with many decisions being held over until subsequent European Councils; 2. Notes the reaffirmation of the objective of full employment and the adoption of a target of a 67% EU employment rate for 2005; stresses, however, that this increase in the employment rate cannot resolve the problem of unemployment and that specific measures must be implemented to enable the jobless to find work; regrets that this issue was not addressed in the Stockholm conclusions; 3. Calls for more effective measures to be taken for the creation of quality jobs without increasing job insecurity, and guaranteeing a high level of social protection as well as social and economic cohesion; 4. Is disturbed at the risks of a slowing down of growth in the near future; is in favour of a selective reduction in interest rates in order to promote employment and training, and of a new type of sustainable development; 5. Deplores the fact that economic, social and employment policies are still closely dependent on strict compliance with the stability pact, which should be lifted, particularly with a view to stepping up resources for education in the context of a knowledge-based society; calls on the Council to provide a political counterweight to, and democratic supervision of, the European Central Bank and to redefine its powers and duties, particularly by introducing employment and training criteria; 6. Stresses that the stated ambitions in terms of social inclusion and protection will remain empty of substance so long as the problem of the allocation of funds for social needs is totally ignored; 7. Regrets that no decision has been taken to strengthen the rights and powers of employees in the context of the directives on European works councils, particularly in the case of mergers and restructuring accompanied by sackings, as the recent decisions by Danone and Marks & Spencer have shown; condemns the measures taken by these groups and considers that, in order to monitor the strategies of large concerns in Europe a permanent sub-committee should be set up, for example in the Social Affairs Committee, which would be open to contributions from trade unions, works councils, consumers’ associations and elected representatives; 8. Regrets that neither the Commission nor the Council has taken up the legislative initiatives set out in the European social agenda seeking to reinforce the individual and collective rights of workers and to improve their working conditions; 9. Notes the preparation of indicators to ensure that no discrimination takes place between men’s and women’s salaries; calls for these indicators to be worked out with
