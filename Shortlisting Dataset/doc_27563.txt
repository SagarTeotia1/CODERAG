WRITTEN QUESTION P-3925/08 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 July 2008) Subject: Weekly working hours in the EU In an interview with the Spanish El Pais newspaper (30 June 2008), the Commissioner for employment indicated that ‘no one should be forced to work 60 hours per week’. In addition, he guaranteed that the maximum number of working hours per week to be established by the Member States would not exceed 48 hours throughout the EU. In the light of the new EU working hours directive and the observations by the Commissioner during this interview, can the Commission outline the provisions which will apply to weekly working hours when and if the directive enters into force? Given that the Commissioner indicated in the course of the interview that the Member States would opt for the upper limit, is it possible that this limit may be exceeded, possibly amounting to 60 hours per week?
