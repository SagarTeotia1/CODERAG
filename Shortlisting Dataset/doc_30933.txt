9999/C Q999 E/258 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3947/03 by Michl Ebner (PPE-DE) to the Commission (11 December 2003) Subject: Subsidies for pioneering solar energy plants In Priolo (Sicily), an electric power station of a new kind is to be constructed, based on a new type of solar thermal energy which will be captured by means of 360 parabolic mirrors. The project is known as Archimede. The renewable energy obtained, which the inventor says will be totally non-polluting, will be far less expensive than conventional energy. The technology of concentrating solar heat so as to obtain the high temperatures needed to activate a turbine and generate electricity will be linked up to a conventional power station. The turbine could be fed either by gas combustion or by solar energy. This method should make it possible to produce 20 megawatts of electricity daily, thanks to which a saving in oil consumption of some 12 500 tonnes per annum (the average figure for an equivalent production level) could be obtained. In addition, the level of emissions of carbon anhydride would be, according to estimates, 40 000 tonnes per annum less than in the case of a conventional electrical power station. The Archimede power station can accumulate energy and can also function at night and on sunless days. Is the Commission aware of the pioneering initiative represented by this plant? Can it state whether funds exist for such purposes, especially for the southern Member States with their large number of sunny days?
