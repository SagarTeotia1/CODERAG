WRITTEN QUESTION E-1555/09 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 March 2009) Subject: Indication of salt, sugar and fat content on product packaging In view of the fact that obesity has assumed alarming proportions in the EU in recent years, especially among young people, and that unhealthy foods (foods with a high calorie content and low nutritional value) are unquestionably harmful to human health and, particularly, the health of children, does the Commission intend to propose legislation requiring that the sugar, salt and fat content of food must be clearly indicated on its packaging? Will there be special provision for certain national traditional products which contain high levels of those ingredients, such as German pretzels or Belgian waffles? Will there be a revision of the rules in order to ban advertising of unhealthy products during programmes designed for children?
