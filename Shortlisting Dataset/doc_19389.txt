Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (9 April 2008) The Commission has not had conversations related to the case raised by the Honourable Member. Giesecke & Devrient (G&D), leading producer and supplier of banknotes and securities printing on a worldwide level, can freely deal with the Government of Zimbabwe as no regulation at EU level impedes such a transaction. The Commission would like to recall that the EU's policy on Zimbabwe does not foresee any economic sanction that would prevent any European or other companies to continue to trade with Zimbabwe, except for those actions explicitly referred to in the Council Common Position 2004/161/CFSP of 19 February 2004, which is applicable until 20 February 2009 pursuant to Common Position 2008/135/CFSP of 18 February 2008 renewing restrictive measures against Zimbabwe. As reiterated by the European Council during its recent meeting of 10 March 2008, the EU restrictive measures (consisting of a visa ban, an assets freeze and an arms embargo) are exclusively aimed at those leading figures responsible for Zimbabwe’s crisis of governance and human rights' abuses.
