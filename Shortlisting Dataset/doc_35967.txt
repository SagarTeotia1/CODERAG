LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL Proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 on the common organisation of the market in seeds and fixing the aid granted in the seeds sectors for the 2002/03 and 2003/04 marketing years ( COM(2001) 244 – C5‑0206/2001 – 2001/0099(CNS)) The proposal is amended as follows: Text proposed by the Commission OJ C 213, 31.7.2001, p. 249 Amendments by Parliament Amendment 1 Recital –1 (new) (-1) The cultivation of seeds is of great importance to employment, farm incomes, the socio-economic balance of many agricultural regions of the EU, the preservation of biodiversity and at least partial security of supply of seeds in the EU (objectives of the CAP, Article 33(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community). Justification Grass and pulse seeds, which are the main types to which this COM applies, are cultivated on around 30 000 farms and on 260 000 hectares in the European Union. The products are mainly used to sow meadowland and stands of grass, but new environmental uses associated with the new objectives of the CAP are on the increase: set-aside cover, nitrate fixation, etc. The multiplicity of species and varieties produced in the European Union reflects not only these multiple uses but also the diversity of the soils on which the seeds are used. The new COM should make it possible to preserve this diversity, and should permit production to be geared to users’ changing needs. Amendment 2 Recital 1 Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organisation of the market in seeds [4], as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2371/2000 [5], provides that the amount of aid must be fixed taking into account the need to ensure a balance between the volume of production required in the Community and the amount that can be marketed. Since the 1994/95 harvest, the production and export of seeds has increased constantly and stocks of seeds in the Community have reached a level likely to affect the balance of the market in seeds. Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organisation of the market in seeds [4], as last amended by Regulation (EC)
