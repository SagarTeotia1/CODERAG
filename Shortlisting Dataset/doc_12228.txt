Question for written answer E-007286/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (22 July 2011) Subject: Light pollution in Europe Lighting is very important for the well-being of humans, plants and animals. However, incorrect use can cause various kinds of serious harm to humans, plants and animals, such as the disturbance of circadian rhythms and complete or partial disorientation. It has recently been discovered that it is lamps with a high proportion of light from the blue part of the visible spectrum (such as LEDs) which affect circadian rhythms most severely. Nevertheless, the use of such lamps is becoming ever more widespread. Light pollution also causes financial damage, since the annual cost of illuminating areas which would be better left dark amounts to some EUR 1 billion, not including the cost of maintenance. Astronomy is without doubt the branch of science which suffers most from night-time light pollution in Europe. In October 2006, in order to improve lighting efficiency in Italy, the association of producers of lighting equipment, the International Dark Sky Association and the Unione Astrofili Italiani signed a memorandum of understanding. Nevertheless, 99 % of EU residents are constantly subject to light pollution. About half of them cannot admire the Milky Way or the galaxy. In Europe, light meters (devices which measure luminosity) show that very large areas are polluted with excessive — often pointless — lighting which disturbs the life cycles of species and the entire activity of astrophysical observers. What steps does the Commission intend to take to reduce this bothersome pollution and improve the well-being of all EU residents?
