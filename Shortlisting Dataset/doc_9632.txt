Reply (10 March 2009) The Honourable Member is reminded that Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA, adopted under Title VI of the EU Treaty, aims at promoting full and effective judicial cooperation between the Member States by approximating criminal law provisions with regard to combating serious forms of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law. The framework Decision does not aim to determine how historians and the public should interpret historical data and facts. Furthermore, as underlined in its Recital 14, the framework Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
