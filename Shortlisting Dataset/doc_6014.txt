Rapporteur's opinion It is now accepted that the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union and the single market require coordination of appropriate economic policies and monetary policy. Such policies demand precise statistical instruments which make it possible to analyse not only the European economy as a whole but also the behaviour of the various economic operators. Thus, the reaction of households and companies to fluctuations in the economic cycle are of great importance in adjusting economic policy decisions, particularly in the monetary sphere. Since it is now several years since the single currency was adopted, the European Union should provide itself with legal instruments which enable it to collect infra-annual statistics which cover all the transactions in each major economic sector. As rapporteur, I therefore strongly back this proposal, which will remedy a significant deficiency in European statistics. In my view, it is vital for this proposal to be adopted as soon as possible so that it can enter into force before June 2005, where the first data reporting is scheduled.
