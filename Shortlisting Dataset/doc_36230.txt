Question for written answer E-000591/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Bernd Lange (S&D) (26 January 2012) Subject: Restriction of freedom of movement Significant restrictions on freedom of movement in the EU took place at the football match between Standard Liège and Hannover 96 on 30 November 2011. These restrictions included a ban on travelling to the match by train or arriving in Liège more than two hours before the start of the match. This meant that the German fans’ coaches were escorted by the police from the Belgian border. A further clear example of the restriction of freedom of movement was the fact that the fans of Hannover 96 were denied access to the city centre. The coach operator was also encouraged to ensure immediate departure after the end of the match. In the light of this, I should like to ask the following questions: 1. How does the Commission view the restriction of free movement of German football fans in the light of the European treaties? 2. Does the Commission consider that the different treatment of Belgian and German football fans constitutes discrimination against foreigners, and how does it intend to warn the Belgian authorities to refrain from unequal treatment in the future? 3. What action will the Commission take in the future in order to prevent discrimination against foreigners in the context of European football events in general?
