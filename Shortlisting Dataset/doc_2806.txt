WRITTEN QUESTION E-0699/06 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (22 February 2006) Subject: Commission studies on effects of noise on children In the Commission’s answer of 14 December 2005 to my Written Questions E‑3655/05 and E‑3657/05, it states that it has financed research in the area of noise and its effects on children and that these studies have ‘indicated that chronic environmental stressors such as aircraft noise could impair cognitive development in children. The studies concluded that schools exposed to high levels of aircraft noise should not be considered as healthy educational environments.’ Could the Commission provide further details on this research and either indicate where these studies can be viewed online or provide me with a copy?
