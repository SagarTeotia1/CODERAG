Answer given by Mr Figel on behalf of the Commission (1 April 2005) The grants committed and awarded to projects under budgetary lines 15.07.01.02 and 15.07.03 are centrally and directly managed by the Commission. The lists of grants given during the period 1999-2004 to United Kingdom (UK) beneficiaries under these two headings are attached in the annex sent direct to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. The budgetary heading 15.07.02 (former B3-1010) concerns the Youth Programme. The Programme is implemented through direct central management (DCM) and indirect central management (ICM). For the DCM part of the Programme, the Commission is directly involved in all phases of selection, commitment and payments of the grants awarded. The list of grants given during the period 1999-2004 to UK beneficiaries under this heading is attached in the annex. For the ICM part of the Programme, the Commission delegates the implementation to a network of National Agencies. Even though the Commission is not involved in the selection, the commitment and the payment of the awarded projects, which is the sole responsibility of the National Agencies, these have to apply Commission’s rules and ensure the same standards of quality and control. On average, each year 600 projects are funded for a total yearly contribution of € 6,400,000. In the case of the United Kingdom, the Programme is managed by the British Council.
