Question for written answer E-007494/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Doris Pack (PPE) (27 July 2011) Subject: Circus as part of European culture On 13 October 2005, Parliament passed Resolution P6_TA(2005)0386 on ‘New challenges for the circus as part of European culture’. The resolution calls upon the Commission and Member States to take measures to ensure that the circus is recognised as part of European culture, to ensure that school education and professional training are provided for travelling communities, to harmonise standards and to draw up a European regulation on visa and work permit issuing systems for peripatetic artists. 1. Have concrete measures been initiated by the Commission, and in Member States where action still needs to be taken, to recognise the circus as part of European culture? 2. What action has the Commission taken in response to calls to provide school education and professional training for children, young people and adults belonging to travelling communities? 3. Has the Commission issued a standardisation mandate for the preparation of a comprehensive set of standards for mobile circus facilities, as called for in the resolution, to facilitate movement of circuses between Member States through harmonisation? 4. What action has the Commission taken with regard to visa policy for employment of peripatetic artists?
