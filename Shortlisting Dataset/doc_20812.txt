Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (17 December 2010) The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member about progress on human rights situation in Turkmenistan and believes that the possible entry into force of the PCA will put the EU in a better position to promote positive developments in Turkmenistan. In terms of PCA provisions, Article 2 of the PCA states that respect of human rights is an ‘essential part of this Agreement’ in similar terms to Article 1 of the Interim Agreement (IA): ‘Respect for democratic principles and fundamental and human rights, as defined in particular in the Universal Declaration of Human rights, the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, as well as the principles of market economy, including those enunciated in the documents of the CSCE Bonn Conference, underpin the internal and external policies of the Parties and constitute an essential element of this Agreement’. This article is to be read together with Article 94 of the PCA (Article 28 in the IA) which provides one of the Parties with the right to take ‘appropriate measures’ in case of breach of obligations stipulated in the agreement. However, in addition to this standard clause on human rights, the PCA provides a new Title VII on Cooperation on matters relating to Democracy and Human Rights stipulating under Article 67 that ‘The Parties shall cooperate on all question relevant to the establishment or reinforcement democratic institutions, including those required in order to strengthen the rule of law, and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms according to international law and OSCE principles’. Besides these specific provisions, the main added value brought by the entry into force of the PCA lies in its scope of application. By broadening significantly its action and sectors of possible cooperation, the PCA provides the EU with additional leverage to address issues of common interest and promote its values, including human rights. The Commission has received positive signals from Turkmenistan willing to engage further with the EU in supporting their reforms in education, healthcare or better public management. The Commission approach is to continue to engage, to encourage and to support reforms in this country, in order to be in a better position to promote issues of concern. Finally, from an institutional point of view, the entry into force of the PCA would set up new fora, such as a Cooperation Council (Ministerial level), a Cooperation Committee (High Officials level), where issues of concern could be raised more regularly and more systematically (and not only in the framework of the yearly dialogue on Human Rights, which will continue to exist). Last but not least, the entry into force of the PCA would provide for the establishment of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which has the mandate to discuss human rights (‘matters concerning political dialogue’ under Article 82) and can request relevant information from the Cooperation Council regarding the implementation of the PCA (Article 84) and/or make recommendations to the Cooperation Council (Article 84)
