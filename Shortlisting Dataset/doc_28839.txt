Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (22 March 2011) At the Spring European Council in 2007, the EU Heads of State and Government referred to ‘the need to increase energy efficiency in the EU so as to achieve the objective of saving 20 % of the EU's energy consumption compared to projections for 2020, as estimated by the Commission in its Green Paper on Energy Efficiency’ 7224/1/07 REV 1. . From that Green Paper it can be seen that the EU's 20 % target translates into saving 368 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) of primary energy in 2020 relative to the previously projected consumption for that year of 1 842 Mtoe. The terms ‘energy efficiency’ and ‘energy savings’ are often used interchangeably. However, the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 114, 27.4.2006. offers the following definitions: ‘Energy efficiency’ is a ratio between an output of performance, service, goods or energy, and an input of energy. ‘Energy savings’ is an amount of saved energy determined by measuring and/or estimating consumption before and after implementation of one or more energy efficiency improvement measures, whilst ensuring normalisation for external conditions that affect energy consumption. According to the Commission's most recent projections, which take into account measures implemented at national and European level up to the end of December 2009, consumption in 2020 is expected to be 1 678 Mtoe, equivalent to a saving of only 9 % relative to the previous projection. The Commission will continue to assess progress towards the target. In doing so, it will check the impact of efficiency improvements (as opposed to demand changes) by examining data on energy intensity See communication on Energy Efficiency Plan 2011: COM(2011)109 final. .
