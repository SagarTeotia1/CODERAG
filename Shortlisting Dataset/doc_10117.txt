These standards include all the human rights standards identified by the ILO as constituting fundamental rights at work, plus the right to a living wage based on a regular working week, humane working hours with no forced overtime and a safe and healthy workplace free from harassment. MEPs call on the Commission, in the run-up to the Olympics, to ask the key players of the world sportswear and athletic footwear industry – sportswear brands, the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry, and the IOC – to start negotiations aiming at a sectoral solution fully complying with ILO labour standards. The House urges the ILO to develop a credible and independent inspection system in order to monitor the ILO labour standards in the sporting goods industry world-wide and based on the above inspection system. MEPs call on sportswear companies to take immediate steps to ensure specifically that the right of workers to form and join trade unions is respected throughout their respective supply chains. They also call on suppliers and manufacturers of sportswear and athletic footwear to adopt labour practices that provide working conditions which comply with international labour standards and national labour legislation; Parliament wants the Commission to work with the ILO to ensure that the IOC includes respect for internationally accepted labour rights in its Fundamental Principles, the Olympic Charter, and its Code of Ethics, and to insist that the IOC require, as a contractual condition in its licensing, sponsorship and marketing agreements, that labour practices and working conditions involved in the production of IOC-branded products comply with internationally recognised labour standards, including all the human rights standards identified by the ILO as constituting fundamental rights. The House urges the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry to commit itself to stating publicly that the sportswear and athletic footwear industries need to come forward with concrete and identifiable measures for a sectoral solution aiming at full compliance with ILO labour standards. MEPs consider that more funds should be made available to the ILO's International Programme. Finally, MEPs stress the importance of increased consumer awareness and the development of social and fair-trade labelling in creating incentives for multinational enterprises
