Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (25 June 2007) Concerning the first issue raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission is aware of the tax incentives granted to United States biodiesel and notes that appropriate remedies may be applied if it is shown that these measures distort competition within the EU market. Concerning the second issue, the Commission intends to bring forward, before the end of 2007, a legislative proposal for a binding 10 % consumption target for the share of biofuels in petrol and diesel in each Member State in 2020, to be accompanied by the introduction of a sustainability scheme for biofuels. The Commission recently launched a public consultation exercise http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/consultation/biofuels_en.htm on the details of this proposal. As well as exploring the design of the sustainability scheme, it asks whether the new legislation should include measures to ensure that diesel containing 10 % biodiesel (by volume) can be placed on the market.
