Question for written answer E-000076/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Esther de Lange (PPE) (19 January 2011) Subject: Take-up of European Social Fund money in Romania intended for Roma EUR 3700 million has been earmarked for Romania from the European Social Fund (ESF), a large proportion of which is intended for the labour market development, education and training, and social integration of disadvantaged groups. Apparently a great deal of this money is not used. One of the reasons given is the enormous bureaucracy and the complex rules for accessing these funds. As a result, projects targeted at the Roma population are frequently unable to get off the ground. 1. Is the Commission aware of this kind of complaint about unused European funding? 2. Does the Commission have any figures on the take-up of money from the ESF in Romania in 2009 for projects relating to the Roma community? 3. Does the Commission have any recommendations for the Member States, in particular Romania, on how the take-up of these funds could be improved?
