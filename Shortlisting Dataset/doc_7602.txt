Question for written answer E-4886/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL) (2 July 2010) Subject: Muharrem Erbey arrested by the Turkish police On 24 December 2010, Muharrem Erbey was arrested by the Turkish police and charged with having: — worked to combat child abuse, organised seminars on women's rights and raised funds for these purposes; — been involved in a conference on constitutional questions arranged by the DTP party; — defamed the Turkish State by making speeches before the Swedish, Belgian and UK Parliaments and at the UN in Geneva. Since these so-called crimes took place at the invitation, and with the involvement, of parliaments in EU Member States, the EU should take action to ensure that there is no infringement of Muharrem Erbey's human rights. What is the Commission doing to ensure that Turkey respects the human rights of the imprisoned human rights activist, Muharrem Erbey?
