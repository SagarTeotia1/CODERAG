and gas networks. Article 2 Scope This Decision shall apply: 1) in electricity networks, to: a) all high-voltage lines, excluding those of distribution networks, and to submarine links, provided that this infrastructure is used for interregional or international transmission or connection; b) any equipment or installations essential for the system in question to operate properly, including protection, monitoring and control systems; 2) in gas networks (transporting natural gas or olefin gases), to: a) high-pressure gas pipelines, excluding those of distribution networks, making it possible to supply regions of the Community from internal or external sources; b) underground storage facilities connected to the abovementioned high-pressure gas pipelines; c) reception, storage and regasification facilities for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and also LNG carriers according to the capacities to be supplied; d) any equipment or installations essential for the system in question to operate properly, including protection, monitoring and control systems. Article 3 Objectives The Community shall promote the interconnection, interoperability and development of trans-European energy networks and access to such networks in accordance with Community law in force, with the aim of: a) encouraging the effective operation and development of the internal market in general and of the internal energy market in particular, while encouraging the rational production, transportation, distribution and use of energy resources and the development and connection of renewable energy resources, so as to reduce the cost of energy to the consumer and contribute to the diversification of energy sources; b) facilitating the development and reducing the isolation of the less-favoured and island regions of the Community, thereby helping to strengthen economic and social cohesion; c) reinforcing the security of energy supplies, for example by strengthening relations with third countries in the energy sector in the mutual interest of all parties concerned, in particular in the framework of the Energy Charter Treaty and cooperation agreements concluded by the Community; d) contributing to sustainable development and protection of the environment, inter alia by involving renewable energies and reducing the environmental risks associated with the transportation and transmission of energy. Article 4 Priorities for action The priorities for action by the Community on trans-European energy networks shall be compatible with sustainable development and shall be as follows: 1) for both electricity and gas networks: a) adapting and developing the energy networks in support of the operation of the internal energy market and, in particular, solving the problems of bottlenecks, especially transfrontier bottlenecks, congestion and missing links, and taking account of the needs arising from the functioning of the internal market for electricity and natural gas and the enlargement of the European Union; b) establishing energy networks in island, isolated, peripheral and ultraperipheral regions while promoting the diversification of energy sources and the use of renewable energy sources, together with the connection of those networks, where necessary; 2) for electricity networks: a) adapting and developing networks to facilitate the integration and connection of renewable energy production; b) ensuring interoperability of electricity networks within the Community, and with those in the accession and candidate countries , and other countries in Europe and in the Mediterranean
