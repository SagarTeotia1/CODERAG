Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (22 July 2009) The EU has been calling on Turkey to continue its efforts as regards the establishment and implementation of an integrated border management system. The Commission is supporting Turkey's efforts to do so by a series of twinning projects in the areas of asylum, migration and border management, in one of which Greece figures as a junior partner. Concluding the negotiations on the EC readmission agreement with Turkey is a priority; until then, already existing bilateral agreements should be adequately implemented.
