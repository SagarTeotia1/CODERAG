learn to better coordinate and exchange their best practices in order to exploit shared development opportunities; 3. Stresses the high potential of European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs) involving regions beyond the external borders; encourages specific agreements with neighbouring third countries with regard to the introduction of national laws allowing EGTC structures under their national laws and interstate agreements enabling local and regional authorities of third countries to participate in EGTCs; 4. Stresses the outstanding role of Euroregions for the achievement of the cohesion policy goals and encourages the Commission to promote and help their development, particularly in border regions, in order to boost Euroregions’ role within the ENP policy; 5. Considers that the future ENP should take into account the role of the outermost regions in the EU external relations policy; notes that they represent a real opportunity to influence EU external policy since they allow the EU on the one hand to have closer relations with a large number of third countries and on the other hand to tackle complex issues like irregular migration; calls on the Commission to provide greater flexibility as regards innovative funding opportunities for selected cohesion policy projects so as to enable these to become established in, and benefit, both European regions and those in non-member countries; 6. Is of the opinion that the new ENP approach must allow the EU’s macro‑regional strategies and that the potential of the EU macroregions which include EU neighbouring countries should be fully used for better coordination of priorities and projects of common interest to the EU and the ENP countries in order to achieve mutually positive results and to optimise invested resources; 7. Underlines that the ENP should be considered broadly in order to fuel the economic development of bordering areas; stresses the positive impact of relaxing visa requirements for the implementation of cross-border cooperation (CBC) projects, local border traffic and the development of regional markets, particularly regarding such groups as students, researchers, businesspeople, artists or journalists; in this respect, calls on the Commission to adjust the definition of ‘border area’ according to territorial needs in order – where such action would be desirable – to increase the number of holders of local border travel rights, allowing them to move freely in the whole border region; 8. Understands that the Commission's DG Regional Development possesses vast experience of the management of the ERDF and is convinced that it would be in the interest of ENPI goals to draw on DG Regio’s advice regarding the management of funds; therefore believes that the management of these financial tools in relation to CBC programmes should be returned to DG Regio, which was responsible for it in the past; 9. Points out that the role of regions is crucial to ensure the success of long-term social and economic reforms and guarantee sustainable development; considers, therefore, that partner countries should actively mobilise domestic resources and involve civil society and business community representatives in project implementation, broadening their responsibilities with a view to achieving favourable results; 10. Believes that the strengthening of the Eastern Partnership
