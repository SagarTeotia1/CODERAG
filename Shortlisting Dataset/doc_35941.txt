Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (19 October 2009) The Commission is closely following the development of new forms of working, including ‘zero-hours’ contracts. Its Green Paper ‘Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century’ COM(2006)708 final. notes that such contracts, along with other types of non-standard contractual arrangements Fixed-term contracts, part-time contracts, on-call contracts, contracts for workers hired through temporary employment agencies, freelance contracts, etc. , have become an established feature of European labour markets. The Commission is aware that zero-hours contracts, under which workers agree to be available for work as and when required but no particular number of hours or working times are specified, can place the workers concerned in a vulnerable situation, especially since they cannot rely on a minimum income and may be excluded from certain rights and benefits entitlement which are subject to a minimum number of hours worked. The Commission draws the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that the development of zero-hours contracts has already led to legislative action to address the risk of abuse in certain Member States, and in particular in Ireland and the Netherlands. The Commission does not envisage proposing to regulate zero-hours employment contracts at Community level at this stage. Moreover, it points out that, in accordance with Article 137(5) of the EC Treaty, the Community has no competence to legislate on matters of pay. It will, however, continue to monitor the development of non-standard contractual arrangements, including zero-hours contracts.
