Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (5 January 2012) Benefits of the EU‑Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in terms of market access will be offered only to products originating in the EU or in Canada. Whether goods originate in the EU or in Canada will be determined on the basis of set criteria called the ‘Rules of Origin’. These rules of origin will be part of CETA and negotiated between the EU and Canada. Their overall purpose is precisely to ensure that through the EU‑Canada Agreement the EU only opens its market for Canadian products (and vice-versa Canada for EU products). The customs authorities of both Parties will cooperate closely to make sure that all the operators benefiting from the agreement fully respect the rules defined in it.
