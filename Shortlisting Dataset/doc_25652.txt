energy mix in a number of Member States; notes the role that it currently plays in some Member States in maintaining security of electricity supply, as part of the energy mix, and in preventing CO2 emissions; underlines, however, that there are risks relating to its production and at present no final solutions for the recycling of nuclear waste; considers that decisions on whether nuclear energy production should continue to play a role in some Member States can only be taken at Member State level within the framework of subsidiarity; 49. Is aware that throughout Europe nuclear energy accounts for 32 % of electricity generation and that in some Member States, such as Belgium or France, that share is considerably in excess of 50%; notes that a major proportion of uranium imports come from stable third countries which have shown themselves to be reliable trading partners and that no adequate replacement has yet been found for the use of nuclear energy; is convinced that, in the light of these facts, any decision to abandon nuclear power would pose a serious threat to the security of energy supplies; 50. Welcomes the efforts to achieve the targets for reductions in CO2 emissions agreed in Kyoto; takes the view that at present nuclear energy represents the best developed means of reconciling electricity generation with the need to achieve those targets; supports research in the areas of reactor safety and new technologies, such as ITER, as a means of consolidating Europe’s leading position in the sphere of the civil use of nuclear energy; 51. Draws attention to the European Union’s growing dependence on imports of oil and natural gas, which could reach up to 94% and 85% respectively by 2030, whilst dependence on imports of solid fuels will increase to no more than 59%; points out that imports of oil and natural gas will increasingly come from politically unstable regions, into which, as a result, large volumes of money will flow and be put to uses over which the European Union will have no influence; 52. Stresses that inflationary pressure due to the rise in oil prices increases uncertainty about the extent of monetary tightening connected to it, leading to a higher perception of risk, tighter global liquidity, and increased volatility, particularly on commodity and equity markets; warns against the negative impact of oil price speculation on the financial markets, which in turn amplifies the oil price crisis; calls on the Commission and the Council to draw up a detailed plan to reduce the EU's dependence on oil imports and initiate a shift towards clean energy; calls for an integrated EU emergency mechanism to guarantee security of supply; 53. Stresses the fact that a new form of political dialogue and cooperation among consumer countries has become indispensable, especially with the US, China, India and Japan; notes that a similar dialogue between key consumer and producer countries has also become necessary in order to develop a global approach to energy; believes that these new forms of global energy dialogue should aim at making global energy markets stable, secure
