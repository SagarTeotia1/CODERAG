Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (19 December 2006) The Honourable Member refers to the project for building a dam in the Caleao Valley in Asturias, where the reservoir will flood an area covered by a Natura 2000 site. In relation to the potential impact of the project on this site designated under Council Directives 92/43/EEC Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive), OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. and 79/409/EEC Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds (the Birds Directive), OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. , the safeguards laid down in Article 6 of the Habitats Directive apply. Council Directive 85/337/EEC Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, OJ L 175, 5.7.1985. , as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997, OJ L 73, 14.3.1997. and Directive 2003/35/EC Directive 2003/35/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC, OJ L 156, 25.6.2003. , makes provision for the environmental impact assessment of certain projects (EIA Directive). Projects for dams and other installations designed for the holding back or permanent storage of water, where the new or additional amount of water held back or stored exceeds 10 million cubic metres, always require assessment under the directive (Annex I, point 15). The contract for developing the environmental impact study was awarded in February 2006. It is quite frequent that the authorities undertake the assessments required under the Habitats Directive as part of the overall EIA. Since the environmental impact study has not yet been finalised, infringements of the EIA Directive, the Habitats and the Birds Directives cannot be assumed at this stage. If the study concludes that the dam project will adversely affect the integrity of the site, the provisions of Article 6(4) will apply. The Commission will continue to monitor the position in the light of available information. As regards the Water Framework Directive Directive 2000/60/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000. (WFD), this establishes the need to develop river basin management plans in order to avoid non-sustainable solutions and irreversible damage to the environment. According to the Water Framework Directive, the first river basin management plans shall be published by December 2009. From 2009 onwards, any plan or programme that has an impact on water resources or water quality will have to be compatible with the river basin management plans. In particular, deterioration in the status of all water bodies should be avoided. On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, there is no indication of any breach
