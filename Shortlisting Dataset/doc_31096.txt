Question for written answer E-000387/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (1 February 2011) Subject: Turkey — problems affecting access to schools for children in the provinces An article published in a Turkish newspaper on 7 January 2011 reports that the Turkish school system has seen radical changes over the past 13 years. The first significant change was brought about by the 1997 reforms, which laid down eight consecutive years of compulsory schooling. When teachers were appointed in the province of Mardin in 2000, there was not only no school for them to teach in but also no accommodation for them to live in. As a result, around a thousand children had no possibility of going to school. The teachers then decided nevertheless to act and provide the eight years of compulsory schooling in spite of the problems involved. They took a series of very difficult steps, persuading parents to send their children to school, using the regional police headquarters as a school building, and organising residents willing to use their own cars to transport children to the school from the most remote parts of the province. With the help of a programme set up by the Turkish Ministry of Education, the region's teachers finally succeeded in creating a class for children and for adults who had dropped out of school, convincing their families that the school would welcome people of all ages. How does the Commission view the fact that, in the 21st century, Turkey does not provide its population with basic access to infrastructure, schools and teachers to educate children in the most remote provinces?
