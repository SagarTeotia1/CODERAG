in the process of development by covering the costs of wage differentials for highly skilled migrants prepared to return to their countries or by setting up ‘dual post’ systems for public sector personnel in southern countries (teachers, researchers and doctors) ". The committee welcomes measures proposed by the European Commission to combat the brain drain from poorer countries. It also calls for greater emphasis on the rights of migrant women. In addition, the report demands that Member States grant an autonomous status and a work permit to the spouse and children of the principal legal status holder once a request for family reunification is accepted, to protect their rights fully and facilitate their social integration. Europe cannot be a fortress, says President BORRELL Speaking at the ACP-EU meeting in Vienna on 19 June, EP President Josep BORRELL alluded to the Carlotti report, saying " Europe cannot be a fortress. Those who believe that a new wall along our southern border will protect them are completely mistaken. If Europe does not go to the South, the South will come, illegally or clandestinely, to Europe ." N.B.

The Development Committee calls on the Commission to undertake a study to examine how Fair Trade could develop into a model for sustainable trade policy which would be capable of stimulating balanced North-South trade, and identify the obstacles to trade which impact most seriously on the world's poor.
