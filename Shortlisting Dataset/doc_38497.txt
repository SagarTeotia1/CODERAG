renewable energy sources and meet the 2020 targets must take into account the impact on food production and supply; stresses the delicate balance involved in meeting the food/fuel challenge; Research 18. Emphasises the importance of publicly funded research which serves to promote food security; calls for investment in research not only into new technologies but also into comprehensive and sustainable farming systems which will serve the aim of long-term food security; stresses in this connection the pioneering role which could be played in this field, for example, by an EU technology platform for ecological agricultural research; Transparency on commodity markets and action against speculation 19. Welcomes the current attempts to raise awareness of food-commodity price formation mechanisms at international level (in particular the initiative of the G20 French Presidency, and the 3rd Berlin Agriculture Ministers' Summit); asks the Commission to seek greater clarity on all the factors that affect short- and long-term food commodity price fluctuations, in particular the extent of the interaction between all forms of speculation and fluctuations in the prices of agricultural commodities, as well as the linkage between energy markets and food prices; considers that such a thorough economic analysis of food price formation mechanisms at play will better enable EU decision-makers to take informed and adapted measures to mitigate the effects of food price fluctuations; 20. Notes the Commission Communication on challenges in commodity markets and raw materials and welcomes the Commission's attention to the issue thus far; asks the Commission to establish better information flows providing timely and quality data on market developments, taking into account the issue of stock dislocation; stresses, however, that improved information flows alone are not a solution to addressing volatility in markets; believes a stronger approach to tackling the issue may be necessary, particularly with regard to increasing transparency in commodity markets; highlights the problems faced by farmers at times of extreme market and price volatility; draws attention to the difficulties that farmers encounter in attempting to forward-plan at times of extreme volatility; urges the Commission to introduce effective and robust measures to address volatility in agricultural markets as a matter of urgency; believes that this will be a key determinant in ensuring that production is maintained in the European Union; 21. Stresses that it is not possible to take effective action against major price fluctuations without adequate levels of intervention stocks or strategic stocks; considers, therefore, that the role of market intervention instruments must be a key part of the future CAP; 22. Asks for greater transparency, better quality and timeliness of information on food commodity reserves and stocks, and price formation at international level, as requested in the recent Commission Communication on tackling the challenges in commodity markets and on raw materials; asks the Commission to take the necessary steps to fight against the excesses of speculation on commodity markets; stresses that those steps should be taken as part of the efforts to regulate the financial markets at global and EU level; 23. Urges the G20 to coordinate the creation of preventive mechanisms against the excessive fluctuation of prices
