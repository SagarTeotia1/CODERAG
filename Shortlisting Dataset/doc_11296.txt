for the authorisation and availability of veterinary products for honeybees but ruling out excessive use of antibiotics due to their impact on quality of bee products and increasing antibiotic resistance. The pharmaceutical industry should be offered incentives to develop new medicines for bees, said MEPs, and more money should also be spent on field-testing them in Member States. MEPs also welcomed a Commission's proposal to revise animal health legislation and called for more funding for EU veterinary policy, so that bee diseases such as varroasis can be fought more effectively. Improved disease control Another factor affecting bee health is presence of toxic agents, such as pesticides, in the environment. Special training programmes for farmers on the effects of these agents and the use of bee-friendly plant-protection products should be supported, said MEPs, along with similar programmes for beekeepers and veterinarians on disease prevention and control. MEPs also asked the Commission to conduct objective research on possible negative effect on GMO crops on honeybee health. Monitoring imports Furthermore, the Commission should constantly monitor animal health developments in the third countries, apply the strictest animal health requirements and put in place an appropriate monitoring system for imported products to avoid introduction of exotic bee diseases.
