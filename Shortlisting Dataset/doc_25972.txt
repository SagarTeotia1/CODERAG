address competitiveness and balance of payments developments within the eurozone; 20. Takes note of the ECOFIN Council's decision to establish a European Financial Stabilisation mechanism with a total volume of up to 500 billion Euro, based on Article 122.2 of the Treaty and an intergovernmental agreement of the euro area Member States in order to provide financial support for Member States in difficulty; agrees that a Stabilisation mechanism is necessary to counter the danger of a domino effect of possible state bankruptcy of Member States of the euro area; strongly opposes, however, that activation and assistance by the Stabilisation mechanism shall be subject to strong conditionality along the lines of recent EU/IMF support and that the IMF shall participate in its financing arrangements; 21. Strongly opposes the Commission's and the Council's intention to create a framework for even more accelerated fiscal consolidation policies of Member States, to demand in particular significant additional consolidation measures in 2010 and 2011 from Portugal and Spain, and to impose stricter rules and procedures for surveillance of euro area Member States and 'more effective' sanctions than currently provided by the Stability and Growth Pact; believes that such policies will only lead to a deflationary deepening of the crisis and enforce pro cyclical and anti-social policies upon Member States in economic difficulty; 22. Takes note that the ECOFIN Council underlined the need to make rapid progress on financial market regulation and supervision, in particular with regard to derivative markets and the role of rating agencies and also with regard to a substantial contribution of the financial sector to the cost of the crises; calls on the Commission and the Council to speed up delivering effective proposals on this; 23. Welcomes the recent rethinking of macro-economic policies at the IMF, which argues for abandoning conditionality related to too severe fiscal retrenchment, liberalisation, privatisation and de-regulation policies, which proposes to allow for controls of capital movements and also for an inflation target of 4%; suggests that the EU should engage in a similar process of rethinking its macro-economic policy mix and economic governance; 24. Considers that any meaningful debate on changing the EU Treaty in light of the crises must focus first and foremost on abandoning the monetarist architecture enshrined in it: abolish the dysfunctional Maastricht criteria for the European Monetary Union, establish criteria for ‘real convergence’ and support mechanisms for Member States to achieve this, revoke the Stability and Growth Pact and replace it by an Employment and Sustainable Development Pact, reshape the statute of the European Central Bank in order to make it democratically accountable and abandon its ‘absolute independence’, to redefine its mission as to support sustainable balanced economic development, full employment, financial stability and price and exchange rate stability, to name only some of the most important Treaty changes to be addressed; 25. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the parliaments of the Member States.
