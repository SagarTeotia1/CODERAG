level in the Employment strategy to be presented to this Summit, but stresses the autonomy of the European social partners as to the content of the multiannual programme to be presented in December 2002; calls on the Commission, the Council, the ECB and the social partners to improve the macro-economic dialogue by a combination of productivity oriented wage policies and a monetary and financial policy designed to strengthen economic recovery, so that both elements support the push for full employment; calls for macro-economic dialogue to be stepped up further so that it can make a contribution to setting up the BEPG; 6.
