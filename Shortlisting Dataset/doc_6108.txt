The present protocol provides for fishing opportunities which are slightly decreasing the fishing opportunities for EU vessels compared to the previous protocol (fishing possibilities equivalent to 12 400 GRT for trawler fishing compared to 12 600 in the previous protocol, increase from 37 to 40 tuna seiners, and decrease from 52 to 36 for pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners). The utilisation of the fishing opportunities was rather weak under the previous protocol for trawler fishing, surface longliners and pole-and-line vessels; it was only satisfactory for tuna seiners (between 80 and 85%). 5. In spite of a small reduction of fishing opportunities, the annual costs for the EU budget are increasing from € 9 million for the previous protocol to € 10 million in 2001 to 2003 and € 10.5 million in 2004 and 2005. The higher costs are certainly due to the better negotiation position of Guinea-Bissau given the discontinuation of the fisheries agreement with Morocco. The Commission justifies the increase with the low costs of fishing opportunities (€ 800 per GRT) compared to the agreements with Senegal and Mauretania, with the agreement of Guinea-Bissau to conclude the agreement for a long duration, and with the acceptance of control and monitoring measures. 6. The Commission also justifies the increase with the importance of the benefits from the protocol for the State budget of Guinea-Bissau. The financial contribution represents more than 40% of Guinea-Bissau's State revenue. It can be questioned that a developing country is dependend to such an extend on a single agreement with the EU, and the selling of its maritime resources. 7. The financing for targeted actions constitute 10% of the total EU financing (€ 1 million per year), which is much less than in other fisheries agreements with ACP countries. The main part of the targeted measures is foreseen for surveillance measures, including setting up a satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS - € 300 000 annually), and for small-scale fisheries (€ 250 000). 8. The Commission proposal contains an article to take account of Commission Regulation (EC) No 500/2001 of 14 March 2001 OJ L 73, 15.3.2001, p. 8. stating that the Member States are obliged to notify the Commission of the quantities of the catches taken in the fishing zone off Guinea-Bissau. This provision can help to achieve a more realistic picture of the actual catches of the EU shipping fleet. It will be useful in both directions, to identify more exactly the under-utilisation of fishing opportunities, and to discover if catches are not declared properly. CONCLUSIONS 1. The Committee on Budgets deplores that the European Commission has presented its proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the present protocol more than 4 months after initialling the protocol. The committee welcomes the fact that the protocol
