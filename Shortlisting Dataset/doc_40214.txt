9999/C Q999 E/152 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3812/03 by Gabriele Stauner (PPE-DE) to the Commission (03 December 2003) Subject: Tempus programme in Romania On 12 November 2003, the online edition of the German magazine 'Stern' reported a possible case of embezzlement of Commission funds intended for the Tempus programme in Romania. According to the article, a well-known professor from Bucharest contacted OLAF with documents showing that vocational training for Romanian employees, allegedly promoted by the EU, had never taken place. However, according to 'Stern', OLAF neither confirmed this evidence to be true nor refuted it. Instead, it has apparently rejected the accusations and closed the case on the basis of an audit carried out on the orders of Tempus itself. 1. Why did OLAF fail to acknowledge the validity as evidence of the documents supplied by the professor in its letters to him dated 26 September 2003 and 24 October 2003? 2. Why did OLAF rely on an audit report by the Commission management of Tempus instead of investigating the situation fully itself?
