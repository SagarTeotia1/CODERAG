Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (26 March 2007) By 30 October 2006, Member States had to notify to the Commission a plan, including a timetable, for the gradual application of the provisions of Directive 2004/54/EC Directive 2004/54/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the trans-European road network, OJ L 167, 30.4.2004. to tunnels already in operation. As a first step to open an infringement procedure, letters of formal notice concerning the absence of submission of these reports are being prepared and will be sent to all Member States not having respected this obligation. According to Directive 2004/54/EC, Member States shall ensure that tunnels in their territory to which the directive is applicable, meet the minimum safety technical requirements laid down in Annex I of the directive. The refurbishment of tunnels already in operation by 1 May 2006 shall be carried out according to a schedule and shall be finished by 30 April 2014 at the latest. Member States having a high density of tunnels on their territory may extend the period by five years.
