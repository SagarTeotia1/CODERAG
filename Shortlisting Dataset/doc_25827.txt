Reply (4 May 2009) Determining the seats of the institutions is a matter for the Member States, not for the Council. It is thus not for the Council to comment on the seat of the European Parliament. The budget of the Council of the European Union does not allocate any specific budget line related to the sessions of the European Parliament.
