Reply (19 July 2010) The EU continues to seek to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia mainly through the CSDP operation ‘Eunavfor Somalia’, whose main missions are to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia and to protect vulnerable shipping. The ship referred to by the Honourable Member was not under the command of Operation Atalanta. The EU is a member of the International Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS), in which framework it is seeking, together with international partners, a longer-term solution to piracy. The CGPCS, through its Legal Working Group, is the forum for discussion of any proposal such as that suggested by the Honourable Member, to combat piracy. Any such initiative would have to respect the rule of law and have the necessary capabilities to ensure its enforcement.
