WRITTEN QUESTION E-2326/05 by Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) to the Commission (29 June 2005) Subject: Detention of Christian Pastor in China Is the Commission aware of the arrests of one of the most prominent Protestant church spiritual leaders in China, Pastor Zhang Rongliang, aged 53, on Wednesday 1 December 2004 in Xuzhai village, in Zhengzhou in Henan Province, China? It is believed that he is being held incommunicado in the Jinshui area in Zhengzhou. Pastor Zhang is the leader of the China for Christ Church, which is estimated to have about 10 million members, and is also the leader of the Fangcheng Mother Church. There is concern for his welfare and safety, especially as he suffers from severe diabetes and may be unable to withstand the mistreatment. He has been persecuted for many years and has already spent 12 years in prison for his faith, during five separate detentions. Pastor Zhang’s wife and immediate family are all in hiding following the arrest. On 1 and 2 December the authorities raided every home in Xuzhai, where the arrest took place, apparently searching for the Zhang family. Can the Commission investigate this situation and if it deems appropriate, appeal for his early release?
