WRITTEN QUESTION E-3974/07 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (1 August 2007) Subject: Safe routes to school The ‘school run’ accounts for nearly 20 % of the traffic on the roads in the morning. More and more children are being driven to school, which has a detrimental effect not only on traffic levels but also on greenhouse gas emissions, truancy levels and the fitness of children. The Safe Routes to School scheme encourages people to walk, cycle and use public transport for health, safety and environmental reasons. The projects reduce the number of child casualties and road deaths, promote healthier lifestyles, create safer roads, in particular for cyclists and pedestrians, and forge a greater sense of independence and freedom for children. Does the Commission support such schemes as the Safe Routes to School scheme? Does the Commission agree that the levels of CO 2 produced could be considerably reduced by the introduction and augmentation of school transport schemes, such as school buses, cycle lanes and footpaths? Can the Commission detail any other EU support that may be available for schemes of this type?
