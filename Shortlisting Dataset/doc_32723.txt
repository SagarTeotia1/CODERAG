Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (30 March 2011) The precise measures which a Member State decides to take for the protection and surveillance of its external borders is a matter to be decided by the State concerned, provided that EC law, and in particular the provisions of the Schengen Borders Code, are fully respected. However, it is the Commission's view that the construction of a fence will not provide in itself a solution to irregular migration. It is likely that the migratory pressure will be deviated to other sections of the external land or sea borders of Greece or to other Member States. In order to provide an adequate answer to irregular migration and bring its border and migration management systems up to the standards required by EC law, comprehensive and urgent reforms need to be taken by Greece. The Commission has invited Greece to prepare an action plan with a clear timetable and making full use of the significant funding available to Greece under the External Borders Fund. The Commission is also engaging with Turkey in order to ensure operational cooperation between the authorities working on both sides of the border. Greece submitted, on 31 January 2011, as part of its annual programme 2011 for the External Borders Fund, a request for funding for construction of the fence. The proposed annual programme is currently under analysis by the Commission's services.
