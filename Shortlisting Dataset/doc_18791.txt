WRITTEN QUESTION E-6417/09 by Maria Da Graça Carvalho (PPE) to the Commission (4 January 2010) Subject: Flu A/H1N1 We are today face to face with the flu pandemic. Following the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), the Commission has authorised the marketing of three vaccines against this pandemic, two of which contain adjuvants. The EMEA has asked the manufacturers to implement risk-management plans to monitor the safety of these vaccines while they are being used through the European Union. I am concerned by the existence of contradictory information as to the secondary effects on risk-groups of the vaccines containing adjuvants, specifically people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and children. — Should there be evidence of secondary effects from vaccines containing adjuvants on the aforesaid sectors of the population, what measures does the Commission intend to take to put pressure on those Member States which have not yet done so to acquire vaccines without adjuvants for children, pregnant women and people with immune-system problems?
