WRITTEN QUESTION P-6681/08 by Catherine Boursier (PSE) to the Commission (12 December 2008) Subject: European subsidies to UPM Raflatac The management of UPM Raflatac SAS, a branch of the ‘labels’ division of the Finnish paper and forestry group UPM Kymmene (turnover: EUR 10 billion, with 26 000 employees) has recently presented its plan for restructuring its European units: 340 jobs in Europe are to be cut, 99 of them in the factory in Pompey in Lorraine (France), which company employs 288 people. These job cuts mean a relocation of UPM Raflatac production to a new site in Wroclaw (Poland). Given the healthy state of the company, this is an astonishing decision with a catastrophic impact on the fabric of an entire locality. Has this UPM company received European subsidies in the last few years? If so, what are the precise details?
