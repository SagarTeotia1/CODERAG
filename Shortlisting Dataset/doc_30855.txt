ORAL QUESTION H-0508/08 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Ivo Belet to the Commission Subject: Low-energy light bulbs manufactured by European producers The Commission is considering a proposal to phase out the use and production of traditional light bulbs in favour of environmentally friendly low-energy light bulbs. When will the Commission submit its proposal? What measures will the Commission take to support European producers in switching efficiently to the environmentally friendly technology of low-energy light bulbs? What impact will this measure, in its most ambitious form, have on European employment, and what accompanying measures are planned for it? In connection with the timing of the phasing-out of the use of light bulbs: when does the Commission intend to revise the Eco-design directive (in general, but also specifically for light bulbs) and to revise Directive 98/11/EC with regard to energy labelling of household lamps?
