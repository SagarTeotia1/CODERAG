WRITTEN QUESTION P-5134/07 by Jens Holm (GUE/NGL) to the Council (12 October 2007) Subject: Changes in the Reform Treaty The proposal for a new Reform Treaty for the EU has led to a good deal of discussion. Can the Council supply a list of the articles / areas in which the national right of veto is to be removed where it exists under the current Treaty?
