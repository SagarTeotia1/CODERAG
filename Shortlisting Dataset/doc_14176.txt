new control instruments in order to ensure effective quarterly monitoring and thus improve implementation of structural operations: surveillance and early warning indicators and performance indicators for an assessment of economic, social and environmental impact on beneficiary regions; 33. Urges the Commission by 30 September 2002 to provide, on the basis of the latest implementation profile, information on the appropriations and regions affected by the "n+2 rule" in 2003; Heading 3 34. Notes that the backlog of payments in transport TENs amounted to EUR 1,131 million for the period 1989-2001, out of which EUR 490 million concerned the 14 priority projects approved at the Essen European Council in 1994; supports the Commission's proposal to increase Community co-financing from 10% to 20% in transport and energy TENs so as to improve implementation and reduce bottlenecks in cross-border regions; considers, however, that this does not solve the lack of common procedures between Member States, which has been the main cause for delays since the introduction of TENs; urges the Member States to reinforce their commitment and cooperation in order to improve implementation in transport TENs; encourages the Commission to impose fixed deadlines for the future implementation of TEN projects; considers it essential for priority to be given to projects that will help overcome the problem of cross-border geographical barriers; 35. Welcomes that the pilot project on enlargement, which was introduced by Parliament in the 2001 budget and reinforced in the 2002 budget, is implemented by the Commission to the benefit of SMEs in the regions bordering the candidate countries; 36.

Is concerned that Life, which launch was already delayed by the late adoption of the legal basis, is still at a very low level of implementation at the end of May; invites the Commission to take urgent and appropriate measures to eliminate all administrative or bureaucratic bottlenecks in view to accelerate the implementation of both commitments and payments; 38. Is concerned about the low implementation rate for pilot projects and preparatory actions at the end of May 2002 (less than 5 %); does not accept that objections to implementation raised by the Commission which have already been considered by the budgetary authority continue to be invoked by the Commission after the budget has been established; intends to closely follow up the evolution over the coming months and evaluate the efforts made by the Commission in view of the budgetary decisions to be taken for 2003; is not ready to accept the discontinuation of some of them for reasons of poor implementation levels; Heading 4 39. Stresses that the low implementation over the first five months of 2002 of a number of budget lines under heading 4
