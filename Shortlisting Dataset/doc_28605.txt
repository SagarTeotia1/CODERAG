Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (20 September 2004) 1. The Commission is closely monitoring progress towards the advancement of different intermediate targets within the transition period which was granted to Malta regarding the trapping of songbirds. This has included the establishment of a Maltese Ornis committee to advise the government on these issues. This committee was set up by Legal Notice 41 of 2003. The non-governmental organisations which are members of this Committee are ‘The Federation of Hunting, Trapping and Conservation’ and ‘BirdLife Malta’. According to Legal Notice 41 of 2003, all trappers have to submit records of the number of birds trapped in the previous season before renewing their trapping licence. The data for the year 2002 has been collected in a central database. Outputs from this database are being studied to compile a report and this data will be matched with aerial photography of current trapping sites. The pilot study for a captive breeding project as well as the information programme for implementation of a breeding system, which are being discussed by the Ornis committee, will be available soon. 2. The Commission, within the limits of its powers, will continue monitoring the implementation of this legislation in Malta and will take all appropriate measures to ensure the correct application of Community environmental law.
