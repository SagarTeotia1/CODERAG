WRITTEN QUESTION E-4905/05 by Anne Van Lancker (PSE) and Emine Bozkurt (PSE) to the Commission (4 January 2006) Subject: Consequences of the judgment in the van Pommeren-Bourgondiën case (Case C‑227/03) The judgment in the van Pommeren-Bourgondiën case (Case C‑227/03) requires the Dutch voluntary legislation on the general scheme for old-age pensions (AOW) and the general scheme for survivor's pensions (ANW) for non-residents to be amended on the grounds that it breaches Article 39 of the EC Treaty. When in 2000, the compulsory AOW/ANW insurance scheme was changed into a voluntary scheme for Belgian frontier workers who have stopped working — mainly on the grounds of invalidity, such persons lost entitlement to what is known as a compensatory allowance for frontier workers, and, for a time, they lost their possibility of deducting the premiums for the voluntary AOW/ANW insurance scheme from their taxable income. Furthermore, they do not build up any internal entitlement to Belgian frontier workers' pensions. The Netherlands will amend its legislation on the voluntary AOW/ANW insurance scheme in line with the requirements laid down in the Court's judgment. Does that mean that Belgium can amend its legislation on the compensatory allowance for former frontier workers, the internal entitlement to frontier workers' pensions and the deduction for tax purposes of premiums paid in respect of voluntary insurance (with retroactive effect) if this involves voluntary insurance schemes which are adjusted to meet the requirements of the Court's judgment? If not, does that not mean that — despite the adjustment of voluntary insurance schemes — that the free movement of workers is still impeded? Is the Netherlands provision which, as from 1 January 2006, terminates obligatory insurance for non-resident retired persons in compliance with the treaty provisions relating to the free movement of workers?
