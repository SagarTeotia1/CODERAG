Question for written answer E-006207/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (30 June 2011) Subject: Food prices Food prices will remain high and volatile in 2011 and 2012 owing to low reserves, despite improved harvests and record levels of major crops, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Rises in food prices are a serious political concern, because they contributed to the outbreak of the popular uprisings that overturned the regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, with disturbances spreading through Africa and the Middle East, areas which import large quantities of cereals. Bearing in mind that governments, especially in developing countries, are trying to take action to curb rising food prices in order to avoid a possible repeat of the crisis which occurred in 2007-08, when protests erupted, will the Commission say what steps it can take at European level to prevent a crisis?
