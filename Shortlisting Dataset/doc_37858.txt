WRITTEN QUESTION E-3732/06 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (4 September 2006) Subject: Appropriate use of European resources provided under the Youth and Socrates programmes in Poland Question P‑1576/06 refers to a letter circulated by the State Secretary of the Polish Ministry of Education to all education officers in Poland apparently recommending that less emphasis be placed in lessons on material with a pacifist or environmental content. The current Polish Minister for Education, Roman Giertych, who is also the Prime Minister, suffers — as the honorary chairman of All Poland Youth — from a negative image as anti-Semitic, xenophobic and homophobic. He is also known as a Polish nationalist and anti‑European. Both within and outside Poland there are (growing) concerns that he will be imposing these views on the Polish education system. Although education is an area which is above all the responsibility of the Member States, Europe also provides funding for it through the Youth and Socrates programmes. One of the objectives of Youth is to combat all forms of discrimination and promote equal opportunities in all sections of society. What guarantees can the Commission give that the resources earmarked for this purpose in Poland will be used in an appropriate and unbiased way? How does the Commission intend to establish this, and what penalties will it be imposing if it discovers that such resources are being used in an inappropriate way?
