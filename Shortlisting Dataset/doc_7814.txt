The report presents various initiatives which were considered viable and useful to the central goal of sustainability in tourism EU-wide. In the debate, however, Commissioner Günther VERHEUGEN told MEPs that the Commission would not take on board many of their proposals. Consequently, it remains to be seen if proposals such as the introduction of an EU-wide hotel classification system or a European campaign to encourage the development of senior citizens' tourism within the Community will be realized.

It further calls for priority to be given to prevention, with less dependence on irregular rainfall and the development of irrigation-based agriculture (micro-dams), increased food productivity with the use of manure, fertiliser and tools, and boosting of the capacity of local cereal reserves. MEPs welcome the Commission's earmarking of €4.6m in humanitarian aid to Niger, as well as the pledge to 'provide additional humanitarian funds should the situation continue to deteriorate ', announced on 1 July 2005. They deplore the insufficient and slow reaction of the government of Niger to the looming crisis and regret the failure of the authorities to distribute free food in the early stages of the crisis. They regret the absence of sufficient government intervention to prevent speculation and crisis, and calls on the government of Niger to create mechanisms to ensure that such practices do not recur. MEPs question the wisdom of the total de-regulation of agricultural markets undertaken under the structural adjustment policies advocated by the IMF. At the same time, Parliament warns against the risk of misguided food aid, and calls on the international community to end food aid as soon as it considers that the situation has improved. It deplores the late response by the international donors to the
