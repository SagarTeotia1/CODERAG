Question for written answer E-011487/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) (6 December 2011) Subject: VP/HR — Safety of human rights defenders in Honduras seriously endangered Peace Brigades International recently published a report, based on the findings of an international mission to Honduras, showing the critical security situation currently faced by human rights defenders in this Central American country, whose position has worsened since the coup of 28 June 2009. This state of insecurity is linked to a general situation in which human rights are systematically abused, without the public authorities taking any effective action to control the impunity and violence to which human rights activists are exposed. The panorama described by the report is one of constant threats to activists, both directly and via third parties; selective killings of journalists critical of the current government, organised peasants, members of the LGTB community and teachers; attacks carried out by private security guards, kidnappings, surveillance, harassment and intimidation; raids on the offices of social organisations and destruction of office equipment; smear campaigns and the judicialisation of processes which defend human rights This document, which was elaborated on the basis of field research and meetings with a variety of social organisations, peasant movements, trade unions and social communicators, reveals an extremely worrying situation which bears little resemblance to the picture presented by the Honduran authorities in the context of the dialogue leading to negotiation of the multi-party association agreement. In view of the EU‑Honduras negotiations for a multi-party association agreement: 1. What is the Vice-President/High Representative's stance on the above situation and the worsening security situation for human rights defenders since the 2008 coup d'état? 2. Has the VP/HR given full consideration to the many reports, investigations and testimonies from Honduran civil society which, like the abovementioned report, bear witness to an environment where human rights are systematically abused, and has she conveyed her concern to the Honduran authorities? 3. Does the VP/HR intend to make signature of the agreement conditional on a radical improvement in the current situation and effective action by the Honduran authorities to guarantee human rights?
