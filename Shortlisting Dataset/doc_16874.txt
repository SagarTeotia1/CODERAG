FEMM Proposal for a modification of the Act concerning the election of the Members On 29 September, the FEMM amendments to the draft report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) promote the idea of a proportionate representation of gender in the elections at national and European level and urges Members states and political parties to take steps in this regard. The amendments also propose that a minimum of 40% representation of either gender would be an eligibility criterion of any EU-wide list for a future "additional constituency" from the whole territory of the Union. 20100922CAN83271 Draft report
