Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (18 January 2007) Council Regulation (EC)No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain regulations OJ L 160, 26.6.1999. , in its Article 16, provides for a compensatory allowance which aims to compensate for costs incurred and income forgone by farmers who are subject to restrictions on agricultural use in areas with environmental restrictions as a result of the implementation of limitations on agriculture use based on Community environmental protection rules. However, the rural development programme (RDP) of mainland Portugal for the period 2000‑06, does not implement this measure. It establishes, nevertheless, in the framework of agri-environmental support, that aid claims for agri-environmental measures tabled by farmers whose holdings are located in protected areas, including Natura 2000 sites, are given priority. In 2004, the Commission approved Commission Decision C(2003)2665 of 16 July 2003. , following a proposal for modification of this RDP from the Portuguese authorities, seven zonal plans for nature parks Planos zonais do Parque Natural da Peneda-Gerês, do Parque Natural do Tejo Internacional, do Parque Natural de Montesinho, do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina, do Parque Natural da Serra d'Aires e Candeeiros, do Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela e do Parque Natural do Douro Internacional. , classified under the Natura 2000 network, containing specific agri-environmental measures targeted to the areas concerned. For the next programming period 2007‑13, Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) OJ L 277, 21.10.2005. provides specifically for Natura 2000 payments. Article 38 provides for support to farmers in order to compensate them for costs incurred and income foregone resulting from disadvantages in the areas concerned related to the implementation of Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. and Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . Moreover, Article 46 of the same regulation provides for support to private forest owners or associations thereof in order to compensate them for costs incurred and income foregone resulting from the restrictions on the use of forests and other wooded land due to the implementation of the said directives. Any Member State, based on the principle of subsidiarity, has the opportunity to choose, propose in its rural development programme and implement those rural development measures that are most appropriate for the country from all the range of measures included in the Rural Development Regulation. Furthermore, the acceptance and implementation of the measures available in any rural development programme is up to the choice of the individual farmer. This may lead to situations where a measure may not be available for implementation by the farmers of a Member State, while it is available in a neighbouring country. This is without neglecting the fact that biodiversity protection and nature conservation through the implementation of
