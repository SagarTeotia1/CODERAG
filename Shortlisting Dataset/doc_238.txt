Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (9 April 2003) The Union has two instruments that can be used to support investment in infrastructures, including that relating to water management: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund. The ERDF intervenes in support of economic development programmes in the areas eligible under Objectives 1 and 2 of the Structural Funds as well as under the Community Initiatives URBAN and Interreg. With the exception of major projects, the selection of individual projects is the responsibility of the authorities in the Member States once the broad strategic objectives of the programmes have been agreed by the Commission. The projects selected by the authorities must, however, conform with Community law in all respects, including that relating to the environment. Major projects, as well as projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, are subject to individual approval by the Commission. The environmental impact of such projects must be assessed. The social and economic impact of the current generation of programmes will be assessed in the course of 2003 in the framework of the mid-term evaluation of the programmes, the results of which will provide the Member States with an opportunity to adjust their development strategy as appropriate. An ex-post evaluation of the programmes is also foreseen by the regulation once the programmes have come to an end. This will provide a more definitive assessment of their impact on the eligible regions in social and economic terms.
