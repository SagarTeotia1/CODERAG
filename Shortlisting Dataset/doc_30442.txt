ORAL QUESTION H-0849/07 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Paulo Casaca to the Commission Subject: European legislation and regional products The real or presumed existence of European legislation banning the small scale manufacturing of traditional products such as cheese, sausages and all of oil, or imposing a compulsory ban on wooden spoons or cruet stands in restaurants, has raised enormous uproar and turned into one of the most significant factors in grass-roots unhappiness with regard to the reality of European integration. Can the Commission not take steps to distinguish clearly and unequivocally between what constitutes the corpus of European law and what does not, so as to allow the man in the street to grasp what is actually European legislation and what is not?
