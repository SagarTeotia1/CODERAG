Question for written answer E-009830/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy (ALDE) (31 October 2011) Subject: Dutch renewable energy targets In 2010, the outgoing Dutch Government forwarded to the Commission its national action plan for renewable energy sources. In order to achieve its 14 % target in respect of renewable energies by 2020, it proposed sub-targets for power (37 %), transport (10 %) and heating and cooling (8 %) http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2010/06/23/rapport-nationaal-actieplan-voor-energie-uit-hernieuwbare-bronnen.html . In its 2010‑16 quality and capacity planning report, Kwaliteits- en capaciteitsplan 2010‑16 (deel1), november 2009, TenneT. the Dutch grid operator TenneT concluded that the Netherlands would be unable to achieve the sub-target for power, indicating that, of the 49.9 TWh sustainable production capacity target for 2020, probably only 18.4 TWh would be achieved, leaving a 63 % shortfall. In June 2011, the Energy Council confirmed this, indicating that, aside from the possibility of obtaining funding, such investments did not appear technically possible within a period of less than 10 years http://www.energieraad.nl/Include/ElectosFileStreaming.asp?Fileld=878 . In a report of 19 October, the Environment and Infrastructure Councils indicated that progress towards a sustainable energy economy in the Netherlands was extremely slow http://www.rli.nl/sites/default/files/rliadviesversnellenenergietransitie.pdf . Does the Commission concur with the findings of TenneT and the Energy Council to the effect that the Netherlands will probably fail to meet the sustainable power generation target? Does the Commission consider that it will probably be impossible to meet renewable energy commitments without additional funding? Will the Commission seek further information regarding the development of renewable energy in the Netherlands? How and when will it assess whether Member States are on track towards meeting their renewable energy objectives? Is the Commission envisaging legal proceedings against the Netherlands? Can it indicate when and how explanations will be sought from the Dutch Government regarding its strategy?
