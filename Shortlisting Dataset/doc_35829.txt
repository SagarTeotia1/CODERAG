WRITTEN QUESTION E-4325/05 by Mary McDonald (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 November 2005) Subject: Minimum income In its social agenda communication of February 2005, the Commission reiterated earlier commitments to a Community initiative on minimum income schemes, as an integral part of the Union’s efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion. When does the Commission plan to adopt the communication? Will the Commission ensure that the communication focuses on how to improve the effectiveness of minimum income schemes (and related benefits) in order to better contribute to combating poverty and social exclusion?
