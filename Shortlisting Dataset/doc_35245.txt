Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (31 August 2010) 1. The Commission has contacted the Romanian authorities to request an explanation for the delays in the settlement and payment of pensions of Hungarian citizens who are former Romanian citizens and clarifications regarding all the individual cases to which the Honourable Member refers. On 23 March and 25 August 2009 the Commission received replies from the Romanian National Office for Pension and Other Social Security Rights ( Casa Natională de Pensii şi Alte Drepturi de Asigurări Sociale ) providing clarifications of the individual cases concerned. It attributed the delays in processing pension claims to the sharp increase in such claims following Romania’s accession to the EU. The Commission has received no further complaints, which appears to indicate that the problem has been solved. 2. As regards Commission action to ensure that the rights of the citizens are enforced, in particular with regard to the settlement and payment of pensions in cases where the rules on the coordination of social security apply, the Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the latest reform of legislation in this area. As from 1 May 2010, Regulations (EC) Nos 883/2004 Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the coordination of social security systems, OJ L 166, 30.4.2004. and 987/2009 Regulation (EC) No 987/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems, OJ L 284, 30.10.2009. have replaced Regulations (EEC) Nos 1408/71 Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of the Council of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community, OJ L 149, 5.7.1971. and 574/72 Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 of the Council of 21 March 1972 fixing the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community, OJ L 74, 27.3.1972. . The new Regulations streamline the procedure for claiming pensions and improve information exchange between social security institutions by introducing a system of electronic data exchange (Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information — EESSI). They also strengthen individual rights by clarifying the obligation to pay provisional benefits. 3. The Commission’s role is to ensure that citizens' rights under European law are respected. The Commission accordingly react to complaints submitted by individual citizens. In the event of a failure to apply properly, or a breach of, the social security coordination rules, and in particular if the problems concern certain Member States, the Commission contacts the relevant Members of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security and requests them to find a solution to the problem. If no solution can be found, the Commission takes action in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.
