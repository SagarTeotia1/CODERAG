CNE took a decision on 26 April 2007. In a separate procedure under Additional Provision No 27 of Law 55/1999 On 4 June 2006 the Commission decided to refer Spain to the European Court of Justice concerning the Additional Provision No 27 of Law 55/1999. This provision subjects to public authorisation the exercise of voting rights by public entities who directly or indirectly take control or acquire at least 3 % of the equity or voting rights in Spanish energy companies. , given that Enel is partly publicly-owned, the Spanish Minister of Industry, Tourism and Trade adopted a decision on Enel's voting rights in Endesa. . In that decision, the Minister subjected the exercise of Enel's voting rights to the obligation to inform the Secretariat General of Energy about the strategy, agreements, decisions and actions adopted by Endesa in which Enel is involved as far as they affect Spanish public security. The Commission is currently carefully assessing the conditions imposed.
