Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (15 November 2011) As the Honourable Member notes, EU co-funding provided for expropriation costs is capped at 10 % of the total eligible expenditure of the co-financed project. In accordance with the principle of shared management, national authorities are responsible for the implementation of the programmes, including project selection criteria and procedures. This includes the calculations related to expropriation costs and the provision of financing for costs that, according to EU legislation, will not be financed by the European Union. The Commission therefore suggests the Honourable Member contacts the managing authority for further information: Ministry for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works (MEPPPW) General Secretariat for Public Works (GSPW) Special Managing Authority for the Operational Programme ‘Road Axes, Ports and Urban Development’ (SMA/OP-RAPUD) 15 Koniari, Athens 114 71 Tel.: 2106930150 Fax: 2106930188 http://www.epoalaa.gr
