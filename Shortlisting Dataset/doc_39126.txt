Question for written answer E-000480/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (28 January 2011) Subject: Initiatives for free political expression in Tunisia and solidarity measures in support of Maghreb and North African countries The Tunisian people has rebelled massively against extreme poverty, unemployment and lack of democracy. It was not intimidated despite hundreds of murders and arrests of democratic demonstrators by Ben Ali’s authoritarian regime. The government of national unity, which was created after the ‘departure’ of Ben Ali, proposes to hold elections soon. Given the situation in Tunisia and the conditions of extreme poverty which prevail in all Maghreb and North African countries, entirely justifiable social chain reactions may be set off in these countries. — Does the Commission know whether the Tunisian government of national unity intends to legalise all political parties, and particularly parties on the left? Is the government taking all the necessary measures to ensure the equal participation of all political movements in the electoral process whilst ensuring transparency and political freedoms? — Does the Commission intend to help ensure free political expression and action during the electoral process for all political movements, including those which opposed Ben Ali's tyrannical regime? — How does it intend to support policies based on solidarity, fair economic cooperation and respect for democratic and political rights for the peoples of these countries?
