weeds, mechanical weeding or other non-chemical methods such as use of heat should be preferred. Exceptions should be allowed only in case of bad weather conditions during a prolonged period of time that makes mechanical weeding unfeasible. (e) The pesticide applied shall be as specific as possible for the target and shall have the least side effects on human health and the environment, such as plant and tree extracts, mineral substances for prevention of fungal growth. (f) The professional user should keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are necessary, e.g. by reduced dosage, reduced application frequency or partial applications, bearing in mind that the level of risk in vegetation must remain acceptable and that they may not increase the risk for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms. (g) Where the risk of resistance against a plant protection measure is known and where the level of harmful organisms requires repeated application of pesticides to crops, available anti-resistance strategies should be applied to maintain the effectiveness of the products. This may include the use of multiple pesticides with different modes of action. (h) Professional users should keep records of all pesticides used, by field. Based on the records on the use pesticides and on the monitoring of harmful organisms the professional user should check the success of the applied plant protection measures.
