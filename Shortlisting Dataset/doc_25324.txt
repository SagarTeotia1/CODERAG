expulsion measure taken against him/her does not conform to Community law, he or she can appeal before the national courts. The rights of the child are a priority for the Commission. The second meeting of the European Forum for the Rights of the Child took place on 4 March 2008 and addressed the issue of child poverty, with a special focus on Roma children. Children’s rights are laid down in the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which has been ratified by all Member States and constitutes the principal reference on matters relating to child protection. The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that its own activities are in line with children’s rights standards. Furthermore, the fight against discrimination based on race or ethnic origin is a priority for the European Union. In this context, the Commission has initiated an infringement procedure against Italy, as well as other Member States, for lack of correct transposition of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin OJ L 180, 19.7.2000. . Beyond issues of EU competence, it is up to Member States to ensure that fundamental rights are fully respected, through the enforcement of their internal legislation and international obligations.
