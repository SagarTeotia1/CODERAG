ORAL QUESTION H-0276/08 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Gay Mitchell to the Council Subject: Climate change and international security Javier Solana's recent paper on Climate Change and International Security draws the Council's attention to some major issues relating to climate change and addresses in particular the implications of territorial claims, exclusive economic zones and access to new trade routes brought about by the consequences of climate change. The emphasis on security and geopolitical power opportunities is a departure from the EU's approach to climate change to date that looks to curbing emissions and increasing EU and global preparedness. Is the Council working towards a position and strategy relating to these important issues?
