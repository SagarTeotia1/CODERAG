Question for written answer E-000729/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (31 January 2012) Subject: Financing of the Natura 2000 network Under Directive 1992/43/EEC, Member States should determine the habitats of the species listed in Annex II while ensuring that natural habitats and species habitats are maintained or, where necessary, restored to a favourable conservation status in their natural range. Article 192(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in its consolidated version as published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 30 March 2010 states: ‘Without prejudice to certain measures adopted by the Union, the Member States shall finance and implement the environment policy’. Bearing in mind Article 8 of the Habitats Directive 1992/43/EEC, specifically paragraphs 2 and 3 and in the light of the above, can the Commission indicate who is responsible for ensuring the funding required to maintain the Natura 2000 network once that funding has been assessed by the Commission, taking into account Article 192(4) of the Treaty?
