ORAL QUESTION H-0346/06 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Karatzaferis to the Council Subject: Acts of provocation by Turkey directed against the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Istanbul and the Republic of Cyprus On 20 March 2006, the Turkish authorities illegally expropriated the Prince's Island orphanage belonging to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Istanbul despite a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in favour of an appeal by the Patriarchate seeking the nullification of this illegal and unilateral decision. In the meantime, on 29 March 2006, the Turkish occupying forces committed a further infringement of the status quo in Deryneia in Cyprus, hoisting Turkish flags on the roof of a Greek Cypriot private dwelling, in which a Turkish guardhouse has been illegally installed in February. Is the sequestration of property belonging to religious foundations in Turkey - notwithstanding all international court rulings - and the continued acts of aggression by Turkey on the territory of an EU Member State sufficient reason to suspend accession negotiations with this country?
