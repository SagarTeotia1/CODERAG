have found a job in the EU, and have at least five years' experience in the sector concerned or a university qualification recognised by the Member State. The applicant's contract must guarantee an income of at least 1.7 times the average gross salary in the Member State of residence, add MEPs in the committee, who stipulate that this salary must not be lower than that of a comparable worker in the host country. It must also be possible to grant the card to third country nationals already legally staying in the Union under other regimes, but it should not be granted to asylum applicants or third country nationals admitted to the Union as seasonal workers, as the latter are covered by a specific proposal for a directive, say MEPs in the committee. Guaranteed access to social protection The Blue Card will also entitle its holder to family reunification - his or her spouse would also be able to seek a job in the Union - and to social welfare coverage in the Member State concerned. A holder who loses his or her job should have six months to find another, rather than three as proposed by the Commission, say MEPs in the committee. MEPs reiterate Community preference... MEPs in the committee consider that Member States should be able to decide how many Blue Cards they wish to grant each year. The card should not be viewed as a "right" for migrants, and may be refused even where they meet the criteria. National authorities must also be able to reject holders of Blue Cards granted by other Member States in favour of a national or Community solution, they say. ... and seek to prevent a "brain drain" MEPs in the committee also say that Member States should not actively encourage the "brain draining" of third countries through the Blue Card in sectors where these countries suffer from labour shortages, particularly in the areas of health and education. Moreover, Member States should grant the card only to the nationals of third countries with which co-operation agreements on immigration have been established, say MEPs in the committee.` British and Irish government decided not to opt-in to the Blue Card scheme In January 2008, the UK decided not to participate in the adoption and application of the Legal Migration Directives including the Blue Card. One of the main reasons for this decision being that it is at odds with the UK's Points Based System and with managing migration on the basis of a national assessment of labour market needs. The Irish government has also decided not to opt-in to the Blue Card.
