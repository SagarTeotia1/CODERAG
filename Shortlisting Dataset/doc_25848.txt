research and innovation policies, and that at the same time the territorial dimension has become increasingly important in FP7 and CIP; calls for consideration to be given to a performance based earmarking mechanism with a stronger thematic focus allowing for appropriate policy responses to the new challenges; 8. Notes that spending on R&D&I under the framework programme is allocated on the basis of the excellence criteria, involving a more competitive mode of access for participants, that require high technical capacity and strong knowledge of administrative and financial procedures; stresses that this situation generates a high concentration in economic clusters and top EU regions, thus limiting positive synergies in the group of regions and Member States which are going in the right direction but have not yet attained the goal; points out that the increase of regional disparities in terms of research and innovation potential and the guaranteeing of actual policy coherence represent challenges that need to be addressed by both cohesion and research and innovation policy, irrespective of the fact that the implementing bodies exist at different levels (supranational, national, sub-national) and are governed by a different rationale (cohesion vs. excellence); 9. Insists that effective innovation depends on the closeness of the synergies obtained and regrets that existing opportunities for such synergies in funding are still not well known; calls on the regions, as main agents for information and capacity for analysis, and Member States to step up efforts to improve communication; highlights that effective synergies necessitate a complex set of relations between the agents which produce, distribute, promote and implement different forms of knowledge; stresses as well that the different national, regional and local bodies managing FP7, CIP and Structural Funds have to be aware of the possibilities offered by each of these instruments and asks for better coordination between these actors and policies; 10. Underlines that interventions targeting research and innovation should capitalise on regional assets and capacities and form part of a regional innovation strategy based on smart innovation; considers that such strategies require an enhanced role of regions and cities in the EU and national priority setting and implementation; calls therefore for consideration of the possibility of re-establishing innovative actions within the Structural Funds with a view to promote regional innovation strategies; 11. Notes the existing possibilities of combined funding; stresses, however, that mixed financing is not allowed between Structural Funds and the framework programmes; stresses that the instruments can be combined to cover either complementary but separate activities, as in the case of research infrastructure, or consecutive parts of related projects, such as the development and follow-up of a new research idea, as well as projects within the same network or cluster; 12. Believes that the fact that mixed financing is not allowed between Structural Funds and Framework Programmes prevents regions from using both instruments at the same time and that effective ‘bottom-up’ strategic processes at both regional and national level could help eliminate gaps or overlaps of funding from SF, FP7 and CIP; 13. Underlines that synergy is especially efficient in capacity building; refers in this
