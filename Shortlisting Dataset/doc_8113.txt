of Council, but also saw the need to be more specific in their own requests, in order to change legislation and close legal loopholes. Several areas of conflict that add legal precarity to the physical dangers faced by migrants at sea were cited by Christopher Hein, Director of the Italian Council for Refugees: the EU's right to protect its external borders, the difficulty of differentiating between asylum seekers and illegal economic immigrants, complying with the "non-refoulement" principle while coping with the repatriation of massive arrivals and the lack of progress in managing the legal entry of protected people into the Union. Tackle economic roots "Less than 1% of the illegal immigrants arriving to Spain request asylum, most are economic migrants", said Eugenio Burgos Nieto of the Spanish permanent representation. He argued that the problem has to be tackled at its root, by helping the economic development of countries of origin and by stepping up co-operation, including the creation of new joint patrols of the coasts of the countries of origin and transit. Head of Morocco's EU Mission Menouar agreed that the number of people attempting to leave Morocco and enter the EU illegally had decreased by 60% in 2006, thanks to closer co-operation with Spain and to agreements to repatriate illegal immigrants transiting through Morocco from countries of origin like Senegal, Mauritania, Ghana or Nigeria. 2007-07-03 Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs In the chair: Jean-Marie Cavada ALDE FR 20070702IPR08711 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
