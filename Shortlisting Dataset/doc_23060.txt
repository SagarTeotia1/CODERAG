WRITTEN QUESTION P-3770/09 by Ulrike Lunacek (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 July 2009) Subject: Introduction of an EU‑wide financial transactions tax As a means of tackling the current financial and economic crisis and preventing further crises, the introduction of a general EU‑level tax on financial transactions would constitute a significant step towards curbing the excess liquidity in the financial markets and the severe price fluctuations that go with it, as well as a partial deterrent to harmful speculation, thus making a major contribution to financial market stability. Some European Union countries have already made legislative moves in this direction — France and Belgium, for example, have taken anticipatory decisions on the matter and the Austrian National Assembly voted unanimously in favour of the introduction of an EU‑wide financial transactions tax as long ago as December 2008. So far, we have seen no sign of any initiative by the European Commission to bring in such a tax. Why not? How far have discussions on the matter advanced and where does the Commission stand on the introduction of this type of tax? When can we expect to see a Commission proposal on the concept and what practical measures are being planned?
