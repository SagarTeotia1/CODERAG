Question for written answer E-6478/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (17 August 2010) Subject: Divestitures and relocations of pharmaceutical companies in Italy and Europe In recent years there have been a number of divestitures by major pharmaceutical companies in Italy, which have closed (or have announced future closures of) local units. These divestitures have concerned both production facilities, such as the Pfizer plant in Milan, and some centres of excellence such as the Glaxo research centre in Verona, the abandonment of which has been publicly explained by the British multinational as being due to its desire to increase the level of outsourcing also in the field of basic research. As the pharmaceutical industry is, by definition, a sector with high scientific and technological content which has important economic and social implications, can the Commission say whether the closure of major corporate facilities in the pharmaceutical market is a purely Italian phenomenon or is there is any evidence of this happening in all EU countries? As far as the Commission is aware, is outsourcing confined to drug production alone or does it also concern research? To what extent is the outsourcing of production and research accompanied by local forms of outsourcing? To what extent is it accompanied by forms of relocation outside the EU? What measures has the EU has taken, or will it take, to avoid the dangerous impoverishment of a sector that is vital for building a knowledge-based society and economy?
