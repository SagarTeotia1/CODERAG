Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (7 December 2010) The Commission has been supporting ocean energy related research and demonstration projects in the past 20 years and intends continuing to do so. In total, 42 projects have been supported in the framework of the energy research programmes. The allocated support is about EUR 60 million (roughly EUR 30 million for research and EUR 30 million for pre-commercial demonstration projects). Soft actions on the strategy development of the sector, as well as actions aiming to overcome the non-technological barriers that this technology is facing, are included in the above figures. Three sub-categories of large scale ocean energy technologies, amongst which one concerning marine/tidal currents energy devices of nominal capacity 5 MW, are included in the project categories that could be supported under the NER 300 initiative established by Commission Decision 2010/670/EC OJ L 290, 6.11.2010 . . Further information on the first call for proposals, launched on 9 November 2010, is available online http://ec.europa.eu/clima/funding/ner300/index_en.htm . Finally, the Commission is well aware that additional efforts will be needed to speed up development in areas which face great barriers such as non-wind ocean energy. In addition to the support actions above, on 20 July 2010, the Commission published, in its 2011 call for proposals under 7th Research Framework Programme, a proposal for an Eranet on Ocean energy ENERGY.2011.10.2-3: Supporting the coordination of national research activities of Member States and Associated States in the field of OCEAN energy (ERA-NET); http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/eu/news/pdf/20-07-2010/calls-2011_en.pdf . The objective of this Eranet is to step up the cooperation and coordination of research programmes in the field of ocean energy at national level in the Member and Associated States.
