Question for written answer E-7443/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (21 September 2010) Subject: Water, a fundamental right There are 800 million people in the world who have no access to drinking-water, and over 2 500 million have no proper sewerage system. The shortage of clean water causes 1.8 million deaths a year from cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases; 90 % of the victims are aged under 5, and the highest death tolls occur in developing countries, where 80 % of industrial and urban waste is dumped in watercourses without being treated in any way whatsoever. When there is no water it is not possible to fight hunger; when there are no school washrooms it is not possible to guarantee a decent education; and when hygiene is seriously wanting, diseases spread, and mortality rates rise. In the light of the foregoing, what steps will the Commission take in support of this battle, given that water is a vital resource in the life of each and every human being?
