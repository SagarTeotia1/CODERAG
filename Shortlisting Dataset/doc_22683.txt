Question for written answer E-6982/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Cristiana Muscardini (PPE) (8 September 2010) Subject: Gaddafi — women and Islam Colonel Gaddafi, visiting Rome for the second anniversary of the Italy-Libya cooperation treaty, gave a copy of the Koran to 500 Italian hostesses, declaring that ‘Islam should become the religion of all of Europe’. No representative of the Italian Government reacted to such a provocative statement. None of the hostesses present asserted the dignity and freedom of women, which Islam does not guarantee. 1. Does the Commission share the Libyan dictator's wish? 2. Should it not take measures to protect the dignity and freedom of Islamic women, to counter the power of the clans based on male hegemony? 3. Does it not think it should check on the disastrous conditions in the refugee camps in Libya, to prevent illegal immigration into Europe from becoming such an attractive option? 4. Does it not agree that the failure to recognise its Greco-Judaic-Christian roots undermines Europe's capacity to resist the lure of Islamic propaganda?
