WRITTEN QUESTION E-5423/06 by Ashley Mote (NI) to the Commission (12 December 2006) Subject: Comments of Segolène Royal What is the Commission's view of the widely publicised opinion of the socialist candidate for the French Presidency, Segolène Royal, that Britain should choose between ‘being a vassal of the United States’ and embracing a French-led drive for more European integration? Since the effect of such comments in the UK is to further undermine support for its situation as the second-largest contributor to EU funds, does the Commission deplore such comments? Does it recognise that saying nothing, or that it is none of the Commission's business, would merely aggravate the situation?
