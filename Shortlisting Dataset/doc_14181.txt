will start the process that should lead to the close re-examination of the “old” or “sleeping” dossiers, and if necessary, to the cancellation of commitment. 25. According to the second joint declaration on the 2002 budget: "(…) the Commission will submit, at the latest at the same time as the preliminary draft budget for 2003, an action plan under which all potentially abnormal items in the budget at the beginning of the 2002 financial year will be examined. This plan will set out for each of the budget headings listed: - the number of potentially abnormal items as at 31 December 2001, together with the amounts involved; - the number of items that have been examined over the previous twelve months; - for the other items, a schedule for examination on the end of the months of April 2002, August 2002, December 2002 and April 2003. The budgetary authority will be notified of the outcome of the examination carried out on each of these dates and of the decisions taken on the items concerned (payments, closure, decommitment and special follow-up measures). A working document setting out the situation as regards normal and abnormal outstanding commitments, broken down by budget heading, will subsequently be forwarded each year to the budgetary authority at the same time as the preliminary draft budget. This document will also provide details of the action which the Commission has taken to prevent abnormal outstanding commitments from re-emerging in the future."
