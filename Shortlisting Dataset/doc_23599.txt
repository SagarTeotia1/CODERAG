Question for written answer E-010585/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (20 December 2010) Subject: Antibiotics from frog skins Frogs are amphibians widely used in research owing to their straightforward physiology and suitability for the testing of genetic techniques. The starting point for some studies on frogs is the observation that they manage to survive in highly infectious surroundings, such as lakes and swamps. Recent research has shown that frog skins might contain new types of antibiotic that are more powerful than traditional antibiotics, and which are able to fight so‑called ‘super bacteria’ that are resistant to all the antibiotics available to date. In particular, analyses of the substances produced in frog skins centre on how to combat Staphylococcus aureus , which is methicillin resistant and the source of infections in patients in hospitals, and ‘ Iraqibacter ’, which is widespread among US soldiers returning from missions in Arab countries and which has so far proved impossible to treat. In view of the importance of the research — conducted by a group of scientists from the University of the United Arab Emirates — on products taken from frog skins, in an animal‑ and environment‑friendly manner, can the Commission state whether it plans to develop studies in this area by providing funding for research?
