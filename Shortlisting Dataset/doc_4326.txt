product safety aspects, effective cooperation between the EU and China has been in place for several years and contributes to improving Chinese manufacturers' compliance with applicable EU requirements. For example, in the framework of the memorandum of understanding between the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers and the Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), information on products of Chinese origin extracted from notifications for products posing a serious risk under the rapid alert system for non-food consumer products (RAPEX) is made available to AQSIQ through the online ‘RAPEX-CHINA’ application. This allows AQSIQ to follow up directly on notifications regarding unsafe products coming from their territory and identify areas where compliance with the applicable EU safety requirements is weaker. In addition, work to improve product traceability continues. Specific initiatives are also being implemented in those sectors where the rate of Chinese imports, and hence the related safety concerns, is higher. For instance, cooperation between the EU and China is very intense in the field of toys, electrical and mechanical equipment in the framework of the Regulatory Dialogue between Directorate-General Enterprise and Industry and AQSIQ.
