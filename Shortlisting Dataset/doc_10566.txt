WRITTEN QUESTION E-2893/04 by Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (17 November 2004) Subject: Funding for the SIL company in respect of a tourism project subject to infringement proceedings (Is Arenas - Sardinia) The SIL company (a European Territorial Pact cooperative which creates jobs in Italy's Oristano province) has secured EUR 17 million by means of the ‘additional protocol’, following the termination of the Pact itself (in 2002). Of those EUR 17 million, 9 million will be spent on ‘context actions’ and the other 8 million will be used to finance two projects which will be environmentally devastating (Is Arenas and SIPSA). The first of those in particular involves property speculation ( 450000 cubic metres of cement for a village housing 8000 people) in a protected area included on the list of SCIs (Sites of Community Interest) which are protected under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 ). In respect of that very project, infringement proceedings have been opened against the Italian Government (Reasoned Opinion of 9 February 2001) and EU funding of a similar nature was previously withheld. Since the terms and conditions which must be met in order to secure Community funding include compliance with the relevant Community laws, and since the case under consideration does not comply with those laws, does the Commission not think that it should immediately withhold the further EU public funding which has been obtained and which will only serve to destroy a Site of Community Interest?
