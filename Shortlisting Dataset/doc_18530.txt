Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (9 August 2011) The Commission considers that mobile termination rates (MTRs), which exceed an efficient level of costs, are capable of distorting competition between mobile and fixed operators because they generate significant net cash flows from fixed operators (and their customers) towards mobile network operators. Furthermore, competition can also be distorted between large and smaller mobile networks, because the latter typically send more voice traffic to other networks than they receive. MTRs set at an efficient cost level are therefore expected to create a level playing field for fixed and mobile operators as well as important consumer benefits in terms of affordable and innovative telecoms services. Against this background the Commission does not share the view expressed by the Honourable Member that lowering MTRs to a cost-efficient level has a negative impact on competition on the telecommunication markets and is harmful for consumers. Therefore the Commission, in its Termination Rates Recommendation, Commission Recommendation 2009/396/EC OJ L 124, 7.5.2009, p. 67 . has asked National Regulatory Authorities to set MTRs at a cost-efficient, symmetric level by 31 December 2012. In order to prevent a sudden and significant decrease of MTRs and allow operators to adjust their business models regulators usually adopt a glide-path lowering MTRs over a longer time horizon. In Italy the regulator prolonged the duration of the glide-path beyond the deadline recommended by the Commission, allowing mobile network operators to charge MTRs which are significantly above cost. The Commission submitted its concerns to the Italian regulator for such prolongation of the glide path because the resulting delayed symmetry of MTRs is not in line with the Termination Rates Recommendation.
