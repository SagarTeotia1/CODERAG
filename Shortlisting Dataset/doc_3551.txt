for example the Olympic Games, the football World Cup and so on. The report supports the initiative proposed by the Netherlands to adopt a Council Decision on the matter. So far international co-operation and communication between the police and security services of different countries during large international events is only based on bilateral agreements. The Netherlands’ initiative, supported by the committee, wishes to make cross-border assistance more effective via arrangements under which the Presidency of the Council is to draw up every year an overview of the international assistance expected to be required in the following calendar year. The rapporteur supports the initiative but tables an amendment to make sure that any unexpected or unanticipated big event can at any time be added to the list drawn up by the Council.

The aim of this proposal is to assist the authorities responsible in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, i.e. to ensure that basic information on the payer is immediately available to them, by laying down rules on the information that must accompany transfers of funds. The full traceability of transfers of funds can be a particularly important and valuable tool in the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It is therefore appropriate, in order to ensure the transmission of information on the payer throughout the payment chain, to provide for a system imposing the obligation on payment service providers for transfers of funds to be accompanied by accurate and meaningful information on the payer. The committee makes it clear that flows of " dirty " money through transfers of funds can damage the stability and reputation of the financial sector and threaten the single market, and terrorism shakes the very foundations of our society. The soundness, integrity and stability of the system of transfers of funds and confidence in the financial system as a whole could be seriously jeopardised by the efforts of criminals and their associates either to disguise the origin of criminal proceeds or to transfer funds for terrorist purposes.
