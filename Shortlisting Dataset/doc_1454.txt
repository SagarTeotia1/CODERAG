WRITTEN QUESTION E-6162/08 by Pedro Guerreiro (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (14 November 2008) Subject: Measures to support fishermen in the Luiz Saldanha marine park in Arrabida, Setubal The Professor Luiz Saldanha marine park in Portugal was created in 1998, and more than a thousand species of marine animals and plants have been recorded in the area. The planning scheme for the Arrabida natural park, adopted in 2005, regulates the activities that may be carried out in the various zones of the marine park in order to ‘guarantee the conservation of natural assets and the future of fishery resources’, and commercial fishing is subject to certain restrictions. At a meeting with artisanal fishermen in the Setubal region — leaving aside a whole series of questions raised concerning whether or not the measures adopted for small-scale inshore and artisanal fishing in this marine park are justified — emphasis was placed on the need to provide financial support for fishermen to offset the social and economic impact of restrictions on fishing activity. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. What Community financial resources currently exist to help offset the social and economic costs of measures to restrict fishing adopted in ‘marine reserves’, specifically the Luiz Saldanha marine park? 2. Is the Commission aware of any projects submitted under the EFF for this purpose for the period between 2007 and 2013?
