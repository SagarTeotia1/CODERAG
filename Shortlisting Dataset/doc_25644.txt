WRITTEN QUESTION E-3211/04 by Phillip Whitehead (PSE) to the Commission (7 December 2004) Subject: Greek fur trade Fur breeders in the Republic of Ireland have recently claimed that fur breeders in Greece receive subsidies from the European Union in the form of start-up grants. Can the Commission indicate whether this is true? If it is true, can the Commission also confirm what amount of financial support is used for this purpose and whether similar subsidies are received by fur farms in any other EU Member States?
