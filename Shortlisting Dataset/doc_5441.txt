Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (16 April 2009) On the basis of an application the Commission has in the past requested the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) to examine the safety of stevioside as a sweetener. The most recent opinions of the Scientific Committee date from June 1999. The SCF expressed concerns regarding the absence of safety data about the genotoxic potential of a metabolite of stevioside, about the impurities in the compound, and about possible effects on human fertility. The Committee concluded that ‘the substance is not acceptable as a sweetener on the presently available data’. Therefore, the Commission did not propose the authorisation of this substance under Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs Parliament and Council Directive 94/35/EC of 30 June 1994 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs, OJ L 237, 10.9.1994. . Since July 2007 the Health and Consumers Directorate-General received three new applications for the authorisation of steviol glycosides (stevioside) as sweetener. The Commission had initially asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide an opinion on the safety of steviol glycosides on the basis of the submitted new data by the end of December 2008. EFSA informed the Commission that they will perform a combined assessment of steviol glucosides on the basis of the three applications by March 2010. Subject to a favourable opinion on the safety of the substance by EFSA, the Commission would propose without delay a measure for updating the Community list of sweeteners in order to authorise the use of steviol glycosides as a sweetener.
