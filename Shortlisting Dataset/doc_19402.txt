Believes it is important to look more closely into the issue of developing a methodology for the analysis of functions that can guarantee women’s right to equal pay, develop the full potential of individuals and occupations, and, simultaneously, enhance the dignity of work as a structuring element, with a view to increasing the productivity, competitiveness and quality of enterprises and improving the living conditions of both men and women workers; 61. Insists on the need for improvements in the availability, quality and accessibility of childcare and care services for dependent persons, ensuring that the availability of these services is compatible with the full-time working hours of men and women; 62.
