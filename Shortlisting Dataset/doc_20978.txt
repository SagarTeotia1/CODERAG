Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) In September 2011, the Commission announced its intention to review the EU Ports Policy orientations, which were established last time in 2007 Communication from the Commission on a European Ports Policy, COM(2007) 616 final of 18.10.2007. . The intended policy review will involve extensive consultation with interested parties and a comprehensive impact assessment exercise. In line with the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission objective is to ensure the contribution of the port sector to the long-term sustainable growth of the EU economy and to the creation of jobs. The review should also contribute to the successful implementation of the revised Union guidelines Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council, COM(2011) 650/2 of 19.10.2011. for the development of the trans-European transport network (TEN‑T). The guidelines foresee a reinforced role of maritime ports for the implementation of the new TEN‑T comprehensive and the core networks, which include some 400 ports in the 22 coastal Member States of the EU. The conclusions that the Commission drew from the rejection in 2006 of the so-called Port Package II were explained in 2007, in the communication on a European Ports Policy. Those conclusions will be taken into account for the purposes of the policy review exercise started in 2011. The Commission has already started the preparatory work of the policy review, launching an impact assessment study and conducting a number of meetings with the stakeholders. A workshop for presenting the preliminary findings of the Commission to the interested parties will be held before summer 2012. The final result and the content of the possible new proposal(s), which are planned for 2013, will be determined taking full account of the consultations and conclusions of the impact assessment exercise.
