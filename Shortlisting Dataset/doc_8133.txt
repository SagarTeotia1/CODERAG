Question for written answer E-000904/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Gabriel Mato Adrover (PPE) (2 February 2012) Subject: Imports of Moroccan tomatoes Last year Spain, France and Italy submitted a joint declaration to the European Commission in which they sought changes to the arrangements for applying the entry price system for fruit and vegetable imports. The three countries called for the necessary legal measures to enable national customs authorities to check the truth of declarations made by importers regarding the actual price at which they sold the goods to be incorporated into the regulation implementing the common market organisation (CMO). In response to several questions I recently asked regarding the huge influx of Moroccan tomato imports last October, the Commission neglected to mention the implementation problems brought about by the current entry price system. When will the Commission acknowledge the failings of the system? Does the Commission intend to propose any amendments to the system?
