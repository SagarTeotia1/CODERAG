WRITTEN QUESTION E-1005/06 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) and Thijs Berman (PSE) to the Commission (13 March 2006) Subject: Filtration of ballast water Ballast water is essential to the stability of ships. At the same time it is a major cause of the destruction of ecosystems by exotic plant and animal species and a source of pathogens which are discharged with ballast water in ports where ships take on cargo. These alien invaders pose a serious threat to biodiversity, public health and the health of animals and plants. In order to eliminate these adverse impacts, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted the International Convention for the Control and Managements of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediment in 2004. This requires IMO Member States to make filtration and purification systems for incoming ballast water compulsory on new ships from 2009 and on existing ships from 2017, thereby rendering 99 % of living organisms harmless. The Convention will enter into force 12 months after 30 IMO Member States, representing 35 % of world tonnage, have ratified it. So far the Netherlands, Spain and Finland are the only European seafaring nations which have ratified it. 1. Can the Commission provide an overview of the problems which have been caused by ballast water in European waters? 2. Is it in the interest of the whole European Union that the Convention should enter into force as soon as possible? If so, what steps has the Commission so far taken to bring this about? 3. What steps will the Commission take to encourage EU Member States to ratify the Convention? 4. What scope does the Commission see for making purification installations compulsory or promoting their introduction on new ships before 2009 and on existing ships calling at European ports well before 2017?
