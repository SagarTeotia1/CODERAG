Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (18 May 2005) The functioning organization, duties and functions of the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) is governed by a law No. 644 of 1965 as amended by Law No.2937 of 1983. According to these laws, the MIT is responsible for gathering internal and external intelligence. The objectives of the Turkish National Intelligence Organization are laid down in Article 4 of the abovementioned law which provides that the MIT is in charge of ‘collecting nationwide security intelligence on existing and potential threats from internal and external sources conducted against the territorial and national integrity, existence, independence and security, constitutional order and all elements that constitute the national strength of the Republic of Turkey’. The MIT is headed by a civilian official ranking as Undersecretary of State, who is appointed upon proposal of the Prime Minister and approval of the President. The appointment is discussed in the National Security Council. The current Undersecretary of the Turkish National Intelligence Organization is Mr. Şenkal Atasagun. According to the above mentioned law, the MIT Undersecretary reports directly to the Prime Minister. The staff of the MIT is composed of mainly civilians, with a number of military experts. The MIT has been restructured recently and its Undersecretary is now assisted by three Deputy Undersecretaries responsible respectively for Intelligence, Operation and Administration. The Deputy Undersecretaries are appointed upon the proposal of the Prime Minister and approval of the President. The Commission will continue to follow the evolution of the alignment of civilian control of the military with practice existing in the Member States in light of the relevant priority of the Accession Partnership.
