ORAL QUESTION H-0095/10 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Marc Tarabella to the Commission Subject: Measures to be taken by the Commission to combat effectively at European level violence against women The European Parliament recently adopted by a large majority a resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union, 2009 ( P7_TA(2010)0021 ). As rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I proposed that a European Year for combating violence against women be established – a proposal that was adopted by 591 votes to 30, with 15 abstentions. Similarly, the written declaration drawn up by Eva-Britt Svensson calling for such a Year to be established was signed by 408 Members in April 2009. Can the Commission state to what extent it intends to act on Parliament’s firm and consistent stance on this matter? What is more, my invitation to the Commission to ‘start drawing up a proposal for a comprehensive directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women, including trafficking’ was adopted by 558 votes to 85, with 22 abstentions. Can the Commission state what action it has taken in response to that request?
