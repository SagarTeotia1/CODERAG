in 1984 and then in December 1998, in the latter case leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission on 15 March 1999. The discharge decision regarding the general budget managed by the Commission concerns by far the largest share of the EU budget, which goes to finance EU policies in the Member States. However, some 80-85% of EU funds are managed and monitored primarily by national and local administrations, under a system of "shared management" with the Commission. Only a small part of the budget is managed directly by the Commission itself.

The committee gives clear backing to the EIB and welcomes its willingness to work with MEPs. The committee's report, drafted by Jean-Pierre AUDY (EPP-ED, FR), "congratulates the EIB on its 2006 activity report and encourages it to continue with its activities to promote the development of the European economy and foster growth, job creation, and interregional and social cohesion". It also "welcomes the EIB’s transparency and its total cooperation with Parliament". Among other things, the EIB funds major infrastructure projects such as the Trans-European Networks. In this area, MEPs ask the EIB "to give priority to infrastructure or transport projects with a lower or negative carbon footprint". They also believe that a "strategic reflection" would be useful and they suggest that "given the quality of the EIB’s human resources, its detachment and its experience of financing major infrastructure", the Bank would be well placed to conduct such an exercise itself. In addition, the report calls on the EIB "to ensure that enough venture capital is made available to SMEs which experience difficulty in attracting venture capital". Fiftieth anniversary of the Bank The EIB was created by the Treaty of Rome and is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary in 2008. Its members are the Member States of the EU, whose finance ministers make up its Board of Governors. Its role is to contribute, using the capital markets and its own funds, to the development of the common market. It is a Community instrument but one within which power is exercised inter-governmentally. Since 1999 the European Parliament has regularly given an opinion on the EIB’s activity report. Until now the EP opinion was drafted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but from this year that role has been taken
