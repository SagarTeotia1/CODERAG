Joint answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-012344/11 , E-012345/11 (10 February 2012) For all aspects regarding the funding and financing related to this project, the Commission refers the Honourable Member to its answer on Written Question E‑12343/2011 Available at http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/search.do . In general, the implementation of PP17 made good progress on most sections. It has to be considered that France and Austria are very consistent in their efforts to develop the line on their territory and to the neighbouring countries. In Germany, especially the cross-border sections to France and Austria face severe delays according to the original plans. A delay at Stuttgart-Wendlingen-Ulm would lead to the continued existence of the bottleneck and hamper improvements for passenger transport along the section Karlsruhe-Munich. However, in accordance with the subsidiary principle, it is up to the Member State to decide on the most appropriate alignment of the sections and the priorities of the national funding policy. Since the complete project ‘Stuttgart 21’ is not subject to EU funding, no further information is available at Commission at the moment.
