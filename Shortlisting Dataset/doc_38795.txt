WRITTEN QUESTION P-0189/08 by Adamos Adamou (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 January 2008) Subject: Recognition of medical oncology New and more complex techniques have been developed within surgery, radiotherapy and also medical oncology with a large number of new drugs, including cytotoxic agents, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, endocrine treatments, etc. The development of new drugs with new mechanisms of action that may be closely related to the molecular biology of the tumour, and the increasing importance of pharmacogenomic considerations in the optimisation of treatment, require a very specific education in medical oncology. The recognition of medical oncology by every Member State and the European Union will ensure optimal qualification of physicians using drugs for cancer treatment where continuing education, clear criteria, and guidelines are needed. Those are optimally developed within the frame of an individual medical specialty, which necessitates also the recognition of medical oncology throughout Europe. — How can the European Commission explain that despite discussions and continuing and concerted efforts on the part of medical professionals within the European Union, medical oncology is still not recognised as a professional qualification at EU level? — What are the action plan and strategy of the European Commission for the next months to get medical oncology recognised as a professional qualification?
