In a report by Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, UK), the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposes the EU to take a leadership position in global aviation in order to reduce the climate change impact of aviation. The committee advocates an aviation scheme as well as its inclusion in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The scope of the aviation scheme MEPs in the committee back the immediate introduction of kerosene taxes by requiring a tax on all domestic and intra-EU flights (with the possibility to exempt all carriers on routes on which non-EU carriers operate). They also call on the Commission to propose arrangements for their worldwide introduction. Furthermore, they agree that tax exemptions on air transport and other imbalances lead to very unfair competition between aviation and other transport sectors, and therefore ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field, and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits. The committee says that a comprehensive package of measures is needed to address the impact of aviation on the climate, as well as applying the “ polluter pays ” principle. The committee emphasises the need for a method, which also properly reflects the sector's dynamic nature, and rewards past and future good performance. On inclusion of aviation into the EU ETS The committee recognises that emissions trading has the potential to play a role as part of a comprehensive package of measures to address the climate impact of aviation, provided it is appropriately designed. MEPs in the committee stress that the environmental effectiveness of any emissions trading scheme will depend on it having sufficiently broad geographical scope; a rigorous cap; full auctioning of initial allocation; the technological level and early actions taken into account in the allocation; and addressing full climate impact. The committee shares the Commission's view that incorporating aviation into the EU ETS is the most appropriate approach; proposes, however, the introduction of a separate dedicated scheme for aviation emissions, recognising that, due to the lack of binding commitments for international aviation emissions under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and the Kyoto Protocol, the aviation sector would be unable to actually sell into the ETS. The report stresses that, if aviation is to be eventually incorporated into the wider ETS, there should at least be a pilot phase of a separate scheme covering the period 2008-2012. MEPs in the committee propose that, should aviation be eventually incorporated into a wider ETS, special conditions
