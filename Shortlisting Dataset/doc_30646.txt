Answer given by Ms Kuneva on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2009) First of all, the Commission has been aware of misleading practices of certain business directory companies for some time and has replied to numerous complaints from companies in addition to a number of letters from Members of the European Parliament as well as written and oral questions on this issue (see, for example, E‑1572/08 by Ms de Veyrac, E‑0318/08 by Mr Evans, E‑0812/07 by Mr De Rossa, E‑1374/06 by Mr Mote, E‑1960/06 by Ms Jackson and E‑2788/06 by Mr De Rossa http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB ). As the Commission has stated in its previous replies to this question, the only piece of EU legislation which is relevant to this problem is Directive 2006/114/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 concerning misleading and comparative advertising OJ L 376, 27.12.2006. This directive repealed and replaced as of 12 December 2007 by Council Directive 84/450/EEC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, OJ L 250, 19.9.1984. . The enforcement of this legislation is the responsibility of the competent national courts and/or public enforcement authorities who should decide on a case-by-case basis whether a commercial communication is misleading and, where appropriate, take enforcement action. In addition to the protection under the national laws transposing Directive 2006/114/EC there are other areas of law, such as criminal law, which are not harmonised at Community level and may possibly be relied upon at national level. In the United Kingdom (UK), the Office of Fair Trading is the authority responsible for the enforcement of this directive and which the Honourable Member's constituent is invited to consult. Secondly, Directive 2006/114/EC already applies to business-to-business practices. The Honourable Member is presumably referring to the Commission's response to the proposal in the Parliament's report suggesting the possible inclusion of a list of banned practices in Directive 2006/114/EC or the possible extension of Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices Directive 2005/29/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’), OJ L 149, 11.6.2005. to business-to-business transactions. As mentioned in the response, the Commission is examining the possibility of extending the scope of Directive 2005/29/EC in the context of the Commission's report to Parliament concerning this directive, which must be adopted by 12 June 2011 in accordance with Article 18 of the directive. In the Commission's opinion, Directive 2006/114/EC is sufficient to deal with the types of misleading practices employed by certain directory companies. The directive specifically protects traders against misleading advertising, which would include the types of misleading forms used by directory companies to mislead traders into entering into these contracts. It is, on the other hand, unclear that the introduction of an outright prohibition of such forms would be effective or proportionate. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Commission does not have any powers under the
