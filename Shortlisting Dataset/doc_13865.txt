Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (19 May 2008) The Commission, in line with statements made by EU Foreign Ministers, agrees that settlement building anywhere in the occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal under international law and that settlement construction is an obstacle to peace. The Commission does not have any instruments at its disposal to prevent private auctions in Member States from being held. Neither have the Commission instruments at its disposal to prosecute private construction or sales activities by EU‑registered companies in the Palestinian Occupied Territory.
