Question for written answer E-005554/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Estelle Grelier (S&D) (9 June 2011) Subject: Future of the European food programme for deprived persons The European food programme for deprived persons has become essential for 13 million Europeans whose situation is very insecure. The programme helps reduce their food budget by means of hand-outs by charities and social services. The programme only costs about EUR 1 per European per year. Together with the ‘Fédération des Banques Alimentaires’, ‘Secours Populaire’, Red Cross and ‘Restos du Cœur’ organisations in France, I am concerned for the future of this programme, given that a judgment of 13 April 2011 by the Fifth Chamber of the General Court of the European Court of Justice has brought its financing from the CAP budget into question. Parliament has often stressed that the right to food is a basic right. The EU declared 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Using legal ambiguities — as some Member States are doing — to put an end to this food aid programme which has proven its worth would be disastrous for its beneficiaries, and also for Europe’s credibility and image. Could the Commission clarify what steps it intends to take to make this programme legally secure and durable (as part of either the CAP or social policy)?
