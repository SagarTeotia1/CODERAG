WRITTEN QUESTION E-2554/10 by Cristiana Muscardini (PPE) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: The European Union and extradition The case of the Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for four murders committed in 1978 and 1979, fled to France where he obtained ‘political asylum’, was extradited in 2004 and then escaped to Brazil, which since then has failed to take a final decision on his extradition to Italy, is emblematic of a situation in which lengthy procedural delays mask an unwillingness on the part of politicians to follow the rules, with free rein being given to ideological considerations which have nothing to do with the law. In order to protect people ideological reasons, any excuse is good enough not to grant lawful extradition requests from governments, including those of countries regarded as being constitutional states. In cases involving terrorist crimes — and, indeed, lesser crimes — surreptitiously slowing down procedures so as not to allow the law to take its course is an unethical practice that needs to be eradicated if we are not to descend into arbitrariness and chaos. Given that the 27 Member States of the EU are united around values such as freedom, security and social cohesion and are having to address problems that the EU‑11 or EU‑15 did not have to face: 1. Would the Commission not agree that an agreement between States should be concluded in order to lay down common rules on mutual respect for extradition law, in particular in connection with terrorism-related crimes? 2. Would it not agree that, on the basis of that agreement, the Union should, through its President, take action vis-à-vis any third country that fails to comply with extradition requests made by Member State governments? 3. What action does it intend to take in this matter?
