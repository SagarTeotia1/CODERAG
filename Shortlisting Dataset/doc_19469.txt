ORAL QUESTION H-0136/04 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Bart Staes to the Commission Subject: Greater flexibility in the operation of the Stability Pact The Stability and Growth Pact has been in the news in recent months, among other reasons because of the position adopted by the Council of Ministers regarding the continuing budget deficits recorded by France and Germany. There can clearly be no stability without (sustainable) growth and public finances that are sustainable in the long term. It would therefore appear sensible to make the amendments to the Stability and Growth Pact needed to bring it into line with cyclical developments and with the Lisbon Strategy for sustainable growth and development. Does the Commission agree with a combination of greater flexibility in times of economic recession and tighter budgetary discipline when the economy is performing well?
