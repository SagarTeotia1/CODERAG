FEMM Equality of men and women in the EU in 2008: for quality jobs More effort is needed to boost the quality of jobs and reduce violence against women, says an own-initiative report of Ms García Pérez on equality of men and women in the EU adopted by MEPs, the first to cover all 27 EU Member States. MEPs welcome a European Commission report on the same subject and back a twin-track approach to equality of the sexes, which on the one hand ensures equality between men and women in all EU policy areas and on the other puts in place targeted measures to reduce discrimination. 20080903CAN36168 Press release
