WRITTEN QUESTION E-1676/06 by Mogens Camre (UEN) to the Commission (20 April 2006) Subject: Implications of Turkey's treatment of Cyprus Turkey has signed a large number of binding cooperation agreements with the EU covering a wide area. This includes the signature of the Ankara Protocol in 2005 extending the customs union between the EU‑15 and Turkey to the 10 new Member States and effectively constituting recognition of Cyprus by Turkey accompanied by an undertaking not to discriminate against Cypriot companies and individuals. Despite this, Turkey is continuing to impose unreasonable restrictions on Cypriot sea and air transport, thereby infringing its numerous undertakings to the EU, particularly those contained in the Ankara Protocol. To cap it all, Turkish Government representatives have publicly announced that Turkey has no intention of respecting its undertakings with regard to Cyprus. This may be construed as a challenge to the EU, its institutions and its citizens. To allow a third country to ignore its contractual and institutional commitments to the European Union and its citizens without incurring serious penalties can only serve to undermine the legal foundations of the entire European Union. How does the Commission intend to assume its responsibility as the guardian of European values, principles and laws in this respect?
