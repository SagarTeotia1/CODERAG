2004/C 33 E/176 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1825/03 by Laura González Álvarez (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (23 May 2003) Subject: Environmental impact study on the Puente del Arco to El Condado section of the AS-17 highway (Asturias, Spain) In its answer to Written Question E-1801/02 OJ C 28 E, 6.2.2003, p. 137 . on the same subject the Commission said that Annex IV of Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 . , as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5 . , on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment lists the information to be provided by a developer, including an outline of the main alternatives studied and an indication of the main reasons for his choice, taking into account the environmental effects. Since 5 August 2002, when the answer was received, has the Commission contacted the Spanish authorities to find out about the possible alternatives to the route concerned? Is the Commission aware of the irreparable damage that may be caused by a route which does not take account of an alternative whose environmental impact would be minimal? Since this is an urgent matter, what steps will the Commission take vis-à-vis the Spanish authorities in order to obtain the relevant information?
