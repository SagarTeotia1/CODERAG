permitted a reduction in these divergences; on the contrary, they have tended to increase over time. Against this background, the Commission proposed in 2002 a directive Proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/81/EEC and Directive 92/82/EEC to introduce special tax arrangements for diesel fuel used for commercial purposes and to align the excise duties on petrol and diesel fuel, COM(2002)410 final. which has in particular the objective of harmonising the taxation of commercial diesel, with a view to improving the functioning of the internal market and significantly reducing distortions of competition in road haulage markets. This proposal was rejected by the Parliament in 2003. However, the Commission decided formally to maintain its proposal and is currently considering how to amend the proposal in order to tackle the abovementioned distortions of competition in a way more acceptable to the Parliament and the Council. Whilst the Commission continues to press for harmonisation of fuel tax rates to reduce distortions to competition, Member States remain free, subject to the provisions of the Treaty particularly in the fields of state aids and non-discrimination, to take other initiatives to reduce the costs of the implementation of toll regimes. These could include the abolition of existing charging regimes and the reduction of other forms of transport taxes (vehicle taxes, circulation taxes, etc.) down to minimum EU levels See Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (OJ L 187, 20.7.1999, p. 42). .
