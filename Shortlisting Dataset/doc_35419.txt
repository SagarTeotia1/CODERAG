Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (4 January 2005) The Commission is aware of the problem stranded passengers may face in case of bankruptcy of airlines. It has therefore launched a study on this matter to be informed on the quantitative dimension of the issue and possible options for solution (solidarity fund, insurance obligations, enforced assistance, etc). In fact, there is for the moment a discrepancy between the protection of passengers travelling on a package tour and who are covered by a common insurance scheme according to Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours OJ L 158 du 23.6.1990 and those travelling on a scheduled flight not enjoying any rights when facing airlines’ bankruptcy. The Commission will inform the Parliament in due course on the results of the study and possible proposals for legislation in order to improve passenger protection.
