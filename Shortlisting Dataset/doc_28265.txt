Reply (2 June 2010) In view of the current excessive budget deficit in Greece, the Council, on 16 February 2010, adopted several Recommendations and a Decision addressed to Greece in the framework of budgetary and broader economic surveillance 6145/10, 6147/10 and 6560/10. and the excessive deficit procedure. The Council set the deadline for Greece to reduce the government deficit below 3 % of GDP by 2012, specified annual government deficit ceilings for the period 2010‑12 and established a thorough surveillance mechanism based on regular reporting and peer review of economic and budgetary measures. In this context, the Council recommended that the Greek authorities enhance the fight against tax evasion and fraud and modernise their tax administration. However, none of these recommendations relates to the matters raised in the Honourable Member's question. The Council has not discussed the media reports the Honourable Member refers to and is not in a position to comment on them.
