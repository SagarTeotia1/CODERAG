WRITTEN QUESTION E-2622/10 by Mara Bizzotto (EFD) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Use of body scanners in European airports, impact on passengers and regularity of air traffic Will the Commission state how many EU Member States have installed body scanners as a means of prevention of terrorist attacks or are planning to do so in the near future? Will it also specify which are the Member States concerned? As things stand, has the introduction of body scanners in airports caused any problems to air traffic, inconvenience to passengers or flight delays?
