WRITTEN QUESTION E-3343/09 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (5 May 2009) Subject: Rejection of applications by the UTAD (University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal) At a recent meeting with vice-rectors of the UTAD (University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal), which currently has over 8 000 registered students, the author of this question was informed of the rejection of three of four applications made under the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) for Community funding for projects of major importance for the development of that region of the Portuguese interior, for which public investment is crucial. The rejected applications already included execution projects and had the following objectives: — acquisition of equipment for the new veterinary hospital, with a view to securing international accreditation in the field of animal care; — construction of a sports hall with a swimming pool of medium size, in order to develop university/community links and encourage the practice of sport; — construction of a new nursing school. 1. Does the Commission know why these applications were rejected? 2. Does it believe there is a possibility of reviewing the procedure with a view to obtaining approval, given the need to support an area of the Portuguese interior characterised by deep social inequalities and increasingly affected by unemployment and desertification?
