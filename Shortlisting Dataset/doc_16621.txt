Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (19 March 2007) The objective of the directive Directive 2002/91/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the Energy Performance of Buildings, OJ L 1, 4.1.2003. is to promote the improvement of the energy performance of buildings within the Community, taking into account outdoor climatic and local conditions, as well as indoor climate requirements and cost-effectiveness. The Irish Government in its ‘Action plan for implementation of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive’ of July 2006 http://www.sei.ie.epbd — Key Documents. , which was notified to the Commission on 8 September 2006 stated, that a lack of experts for the energy performance certification of buildings and for the inspection of boilers and air conditioning systems is one reason for the delayed Irish implementation of the directive in question. Furthermore, the Irish Government referred to the incomplete European standards on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive as justification for not having implemented the directive in due time. Currently these standards are being adopted by formal vote by the Comité Européen de Normalisation (CEN). In its all-embracing notification to the Commission of 23 and 24 January 2007, the Irish Government presented a detailed concordance table for a full implementation of the directive including a preview of a phase-in of 3 years for the full application of the directive's provisions.
