WRITTEN QUESTION E-2143/04 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 September 2004) Subject: Closure of the Gabor shoe factory The multinational shoe manufacturer of German origin, Gabor Shoes & Fashion, still has two factories in Portugal: — at Trofa, set up about 16 years ago, with 200 workers (but it used to have more than 600), — in Barcelos, set up more recently, with about 700 workers (but it used to have more than 1000 ). In the meantime it emerges that the company already has a factory in Slovakia and is thought to be about to open another. The workers at the Trofa factory, most of whom are women, are under pressure to have their contracts annulled and are being threatened with a transfer to Barcelos. There are grave suspicions about Gabor's real intentions, especially as regards Trofa. The workers suspect that the factory will be closed down after the summer holidays. 1. Can the Commission say whether Gabor has received Community funding since it set up business in Portugal and, if so, under what conditions? How will its workers' jobs and development in the region be safeguarded? 2. Will Gabor continue to receive financial support from the European Union in order to set up business in other accession countries, in view of what is happening in Portugal? 3. Will Community funding for Gabor be discontinued if the multinational goes ahead with the closure of a factory in Portugal, with a view to safeguarding jobs in the Trofa and Barcelos factories?
