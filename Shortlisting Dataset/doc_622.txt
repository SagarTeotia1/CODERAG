Answer given by Mr Liikanen on behalf of the Commission (29 April 2002) Most passenger cars today have a maximum design speed in excess of 140 kilometres per hour (km/h). Since the Community motor vehicle legislation sets no maximum limit for design speed of vehicles, Member States cannot refuse to issue Community type-approvals for cars with high-speed performance. However, the issue of a Community type-approval cannot be interpreted as providing clearance for the vehicle to be driven at speeds exceeding the speed limits set for public roads. It must be noted that on some portions of the motorway network in the Community territory the speed of vehicles is not limited and that driving rules fall largely under the competence of the Member States according to the principle of subsidiarity. There is no Community legislation that restricts the advertiser from mentioning the maximum speed of a motor vehicle in an advertisement. However there exists national legislation and codes of conduct that forbid the use of concepts based on speed in cars advertising.
