WRITTEN QUESTION E-1630/05 by Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) and Satu Hassi (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (3 May 2005) Subject: Road tunnel in the centre of Lisbon — Portugal The Municipality of Lisbon is building a road tunnel in the city centre, a project that is likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of its nature, location and dimension. The project was not submitted to an impact assessment. A platform of civil society organisations has made a complaint to the Commission on non-compliance with obligations under Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 . of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended by Directive 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5 . of 3 March 1997, the complaint was registered under number 2004/4239. The Commission has not responded to the complaint or communicated with the complainants since February 2004. Since then the ‘Amoreiras-Marquês road tunnel project’ has developed further; the construction began, then was interrupted by a court order due to the failure to assess the environmental impact, then started again because the municipality of Lisbon won a judicial appeal. 1. Can the Commission ascertain that European legislation on environmental impact assessment has been respected as regards the road tunnel project in Lisbon? 2. Have EU funds been applied for and/or granted for the project? 3. When does the Commission intend to respond to the complaint?
