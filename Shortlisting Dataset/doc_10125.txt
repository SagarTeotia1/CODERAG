the product was made by the same manufacturer; supplying goods or services to consumers who have not requested them, unless it is made clear that they are free; advertising products in such a way as to disguise the commercial intent of the communication. Similarly the House felt that "advertorials" (articles or features published in exchange for payment) should comply with the directive "if the marketers rather that the publishers control their content" . Furthermore traders and publishers must make it clear that such features are in fact advertisements, for example by heading them "advertisement feature" . Parliament voted to amend the Commission proposal by defining the term "particular group of consumers" as a group of consumers who have distinct characteristics such as vulnerability due to age, disability, physical or mental conditions and similar, all of which may influence their assessment or their reaction capacities. Finally the House adopted an amendment stating that the Commission must report regularly to the EP and the Council on the application of the directive in the Member States and should put forward, every five years, a proposal for a revised list of commercial practices which are in all circumstances considered unfair.

MEPs argued that the major aims of this directive should be to enhance consumer protection, avoid over-indebtedness and provide optimum harmonisation of the laws and procedures of the Member States. Parliament therefore stated that Member States should retain the right to grant their consumers even higher standards of protection. However, MEPs acknowledged that in some areas full harmonisation may be needed to ensure that consumers can compare offers and hence boost the internal market in consumer credit. An example would be the rules on the annual percentage rate of charge laid down in the directive. MEPs wish to exclude various types of loans from the directive. These include credit agreements of less than €500 or more than €100,000 in net loan, further credit
