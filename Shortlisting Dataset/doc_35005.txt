Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (12 November 2007) The Commission is aware of the project to improve the AV‑562 road. The Honourable Member refers to the implementation of the road improvement works without a prior environmental impact assessment. The Commission would like to point out that, according to Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985. , as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 OJ L 73, 14.3.1997. , Member States are obliged to ensure that, before development consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia , of their nature, size or location, are made subject to an assessment of the environmental effects. In the case of projects listed in Annex II to the EIA Directive, Member States have to determine if the project is likely to have significant effects on the environment on a case-by-case basis or by using thresholds or criteria. However, since road improvement projects are not included in Annexes I and II of the EIA Directive, unless they are considered as any change of road construction projects already authorised, executed or in the process of being executed, and then covered by point 13 of Annex II, it cannot be concluded that the abovementioned provisions have not been respected. The Commission has also examined the likely impact of the infrastructure referred to on the habitats and species protected by Council Directives 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. and 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. . Thus, the Commission requested information from the Spanish authorities regarding the assessment (as required by the Habitats Directive) of the infrastructure on the sites; and the appropriate protective measures taken by the authorities in view of the directive’s conservation objective, for the purpose of safeguarding the relevant ecological interest which those sites have at national level. The assessment of the Spanish reply has shown that the authorities carried out an assessment of the road improvement implications for the site in view of the site's conservation objective, concluding that, subject to some mitigation measures, the impact was not significant. Under these circumstances there is no sufficient evidence at present to identify a breach of Environmental Community Law.
