Question for written answer E-009518/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (21 October 2011) Subject: Protection of consumer rights in electronic commerce According to a study on consumer behaviour in a digital environment that was presented recently to the Committee on the internal market, sales of goods and services via the Internet are on the increase. An important factor in this is the extent to which households are connected to the Internet. Eurostat's figure for this is 70 % in 2010, almost double the figure five years previously. However, there are substantial differences between the Member States both as regards the number of households connected and the number of firms selling their products via Internet and also as regards the orientation of consumers to domestic or foreign markets. European consumers are currently increasingly purchasing goods and services from suppliers in non-Member States. In view of the need to protect consumers in the European Union, is the Commission preparing measures in the near future to improve the existing legal provisions for the protection of online transactions with suppliers from third countries?
