been prepared; 23. Welcomes the idea of introducing compulsory harmonised pictograms on medical packaging, based on the European classification of drugs according to their effects; 24. Points out the danger of blind spots; calls for rapid, low-cost measures for the fitting of lorries with mirrors to eliminate blind spots; calls on the Commission to consider the need for and feasibility of revising Community legislation in order to enable manufacturers to introduce central A pillars offering a better field of vision ; calls for the fitting of articulated lorries with "front view mirrors" in particular, so as to counteract the blind spot for drivers at pedestrian crossings; 25. Recalls that a newer car fleet would also be a safer one; regrets that the Commission Communication on the taxation of passenger cars in the European Union ( COM(2002)0431 ) and the subsequent resolution adopted by the European Parliament OJ C 83 E, 2.4.2004, p. 191. have not led to the suggested replacement of registration taxes by annual road taxes, thus forfeiting an improvement in the functioning of the internal market and a faster introduction of newer and safer cars; calls on the Commission to put forward incentive programmes for the renewal of the vehicle fleet, including agricultural vehicles, which would bring clear benefits not only in terms of road safety and the environment but also in terms of industrial development; to this end, calls on the Commission to assess the effect of the increased use of 4x4 vehicles and of other vehicles intended for other purposes (quads, buggies, etc.) on the accident rate and to put forward measures to reduce the risks posed by them; 26. Is keen to preserve the cultural heritage represented by historic vehicles; therefore urges that planned legislation should take into consideration any unintentional but potentially negative effects on the use - and thus also the preservation - of historic vehicles; 27. Recalls that an incident-prone road network and a road network which does not minimise the consequences of accidents is a major safety hazard; recognises that roads should be upgraded to accommodate current traffic levels and built according to standards which take into account the needs of all road users, including the more vulnerable ones; strongly favours the endeavours of the Commission to introduce a harmonised definition of black spots, Community signs, motorist information, and counter-measures; 28. Regards a framework directive on safe infrastructure management as a useful tool for implementing an integrated approach to road safety; considers that such a directive should establish which operational procedures are required at the design, construction and operational stages of new and existing roads to ensure that they meet all safety standards, encourage national programmes to find solutions for road sections which present a high risk of accidents, in particular by doing away with level crossings, and contribute to setting up expert networks enabling "best in Europe" approaches to safe road design and management; stresses that the Member States should systematically take account of the safety of all drivers (of motorcycles, bicycles, heavy vehicles, etc.) and of accident prevention when designing and
