WRITTEN QUESTION E-3673/05 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (14 October 2005) Subject: Working conditions of seafarers Further to its answer to my Written Question E‑2983/05, in view of the recent controversy regarding plans by Irish Ferries to sack 500 of its crew and to employ 500 workers from eastern Europe at much lower wages and poorer working conditions, of the strong condemnation of these plans by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister of Ireland) Bertie Ahern in the Dail (lower house of the Irish Parliament) on 28 September 2005, and of the failure so far of seafarers' and ship-owners' representatives to reach agreement on this issue under the European social dialogue, despite the Commission's paper of December 2004, does the Commission not believe that the time has now come to re-activate and re-submit its proposal on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States — COM(1998)251 OJ C 213, 9.7.1998, p. 17 . of April 1998 and amended proposal COM(2000)437 OJ C 337 E, 28.11.2000, p. 214 . of July 2000?
