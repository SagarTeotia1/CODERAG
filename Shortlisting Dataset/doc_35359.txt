Joint answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-007182/11 , E-007183/11 , E-007184/11 (23 August 2011) As the Honourable Member seems to refer to concrete cases, the Commission does not have sufficient details on the matter to be able to investigate the problem raised and is therefore not in a position to answer the questions. Furthermore, since the EU legislation concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital is based on a Directive, each Member State is responsible for the transposition of these provisions into national legislation and their correct application within its territory. Therefore, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the national authorities for a precise reply. In general terms, the Commission can only confirm that a combined application of Article 4 and Article 5(1)(e) of Council Directive 2008/7/EC Council Directive 2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (OJ L 46, 21.2.2008). could only apply to the situations referred to by the Honourable Member provided a number of conditions as described in Article 4(1) and (2) relating to the nature of the transferor and acquirer, transfer and consideration are fulfilled.
