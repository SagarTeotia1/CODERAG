Question for written answer E-000632/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President/High Representative) Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (27 January 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Residents of Camp Ashraf could be transferred to Camp Liberty According to the latest news reports by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), al-Maliki’s government is equipping the Camp Liberty area with surveillance equipment in order to eavesdrop on and monitor future residents. Camp Liberty was built to accommodate young American soldiers for a short period of time. According to the American army, the camp is not suitable for long stays and may cause psychological problems in those who reside there for a long time. In addition, the Iraqi Government intends to transfer the residents of Camp Ashraf to an area equal to just 1.5 % of the area of Camp Liberty. In addition to limiting the physical space and installing monitoring and surveillance equipment, al-Maliki wants to build walls to isolate that part of the camp from the rest. The Iraqi Government intends to transform the new camp into a real prison for the residents of Ashraf. Al-Maliki maintains that the residents of Camp Ashraf are terrorists and criminals and, as such, does not want them to remain on his territory. According to the Iraqi leader, by April, Camp Ashraf will no longer exist. Ms Rajavi and the NCRI denounce the provocations by al-Maliki and the situation of hardship faced by the residents of Camp Ashraf almost daily. Transfer to Camp Liberty could cause shock to those who are most vulnerable. Given the numerous appeals to the international community and the recent actions taken by al-Maliki, I ask the Vice‑President/High Representative, what is the position of the European Union on the transfer to Camp Liberty and the closure of Camp Ashraf?
