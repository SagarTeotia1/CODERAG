Question for oral answer O-000069/2011 to the Council Rule 115 Rui Tavares on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group Subject: Appropriate response to the migration flows in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean The wave of political revolution in North Africa has been accompanied by migration flows as people flee instability and violence, particularly in the case of Libya. So far, these movements have been confined to within the region (Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria). However, several thousand people (in particular Tunisians and, recently, Eritreans) are also reported to have arrived on the shores of Lampedusa. Given that these movements call for solidarity both towards neighbouring countries and within the EU, can the Council clarify: 1. What it plans to do in order to help the countries of the region to manage the situation and support those who cannot leave the region and who could require international protection? 2. What it intends to do, given the critical situation of migrants and refugees on Lampedusa and in Evros, in order to make Italy and Greece enforce the 2001 Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC) and the 2003 Reception Directive (2003/9/EC)? 3. What it intends to do, given the particularly vulnerable situation of unaccompanied minors reported to have arrived on Lampedusa, to ensure the adequate protection of this group? 4. What it intends to do as regards relocation of refugees in the EU, and between the various Member States, particularly with regard to applicants for entry who require international protection? 5. What it intends to do to establish more effective solidarity mechanisms among Member States? 6. In the longer term, what it intends to do to ensure that the EU common asylum system becomes a reality by 2012?
