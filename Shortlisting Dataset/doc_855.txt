WRITTEN QUESTION E-4674/09 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (6 October 2009) Subject: Disposal of toxic and hazardous waste The Member States’ competent authorities submit reports on the implementation of Directive 91/689/EEC OJ L 377, 31.12.1991, p. 20. on hazardous waste, containing information on the annual quantities of waste produced and the methods used to dispose of or recycle it. In Greece about two thirds of hazardous waste produced is stored temporarily before its final disposal. Can the Commission say what quantities of hazardous waste have been produced each year in Greece since 2003, and what was done with it? Which sites are used for final disposal of hazardous waste in Greece? Under Community law, if hazardous waste remains in temporary storage for more than a year, the temporary storage site must be designated as a waste dump and comply with the relevant requirements. Which waste dumps in Greece fulfil the requirements for disposal of toxic waste? Have the competent Greek authorities notified to the Commission, as they were obliged to do under the relevant Community legislation, all the data since 2003 on the quantities of toxic and hazardous waste produced and its disposal? Have they completed and submitted the relevant questionnaires and, if so, what information do they contain?
