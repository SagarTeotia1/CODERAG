Joint answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-010924/10 , E-010925/10 (10 February 2011) The Digital Agenda for Europe COM(2010) 245 final, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:PDF has ‘a vibrant digital single market’ as the first of seven pillars, stating that online markets, both globally and in the EU, are still separated by multiple barriers. An effective implementation of the Digital Agenda requires a meticulous execution of the comprehensive set of actions and a governance structure in accordance with the governance of Europe 2020 is set up, cf. Chapter 3. This governance structure encompasses several coordination mechanisms: a Commissioners' Group, an inter-service group, close cooperation with Member States, the Parliament and interested stakeholders, establishing a ‘High Level Group’ to work with Member States, regular dialogue with representatives of the European Parliaments and action oriented platforms with a wide range of stakeholders. The ‘Digital Agenda High Level Group’ is listed in the Register of Commission Expert Groups and Other Similar Entities as an informal expert group advising the Commission see http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/detailGroup.cfm?groupID=2534 . A Commission decision to set up a formal group is under preparation. The Group is composed of high-level representatives (at Director-General level) from Member States' administrations and of observers from candidate, EFTA and EEA countries. The inaugural meeting was held on 26 October 2010. All 27 Member States and the six EFTA/EEA/candidate countries have nominated representatives. Close cooperation with the Parliament is foreseen in the Digital Agenda Communication, in particular for the organisation of the annual Digital Agenda Assembly, which will take place on 16 and 17 June 2011 in Brussels.
