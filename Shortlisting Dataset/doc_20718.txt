because Commission Decision 2003/426/EC implies that it is a novel food. For other foods and food ingredients, if appropriate and necessary, a Decision whether a food or food ingredient falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) 258/97 may be taken pursuant to Article 1.3 of the Regulation according to the procedure provided for in Article 13. Member States and the Commission agree that a request for an opinion about substantial equivalence should not be denied. In the unlikely event of such a refusal from a national authority, the recourse to legal remedies would be a question of national administrative law. However, it should be noted that the simplified procedure is applicable only to products that are substantially equivalent to existing foods and food ingredients, which include foods that were authorised pursuant to the Novel Food Regulation. Obviously, the specified conditions of use have to be taken into account. Finally, the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that a revision of Regulation (EC) 258/97 will be undertaken in the course of 2004 in order to remedy any problems raised in the context of the application of the Regulation and ensure legal certainty and clarity for operators and public authorities.
