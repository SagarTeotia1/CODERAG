Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (2 May 2011) The Honourable Member's question refers to the project ‘Interstrat-Espon in Integrated Territorial Strategies’, which is part of the ESPON 2013 programme The European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion. . The ESPON 2013 programme is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund. Interstrat-Espon is a Transnational Networking Activity (TNA), which aims to promote the use of ESPON findings in integrated territorial development strategies and to support transnational learning on the contribution of ESPON to integrated policy-making. The lead partner of this project is the Royal Town Planning Institute in the United Kingdom and the total allocated budget is EUR 881 973. Detailed information on this project can be found under the following link: http://www.espon.eu/main/Menu_Projects/Menu_TransnationalNetworkingActivities/interstrat.html TNAs are carried out by grouping of members of ESPON contact points, a European-wide network of national institutions nominated by the Member and Partner States involved in the ESPON 2013 programme. These activities support transnational interest in ESPON by involving policy‑makers, practitioners and scientists. TNAs are carried out under Priority 4 of the ESPON programme and are part-financed at the level of 79 % by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the European Territorial Cooperation Objective. The remaining resources are provided by the 31 countries participating in the ESPON programme (the 27 Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.) For more information on the project selection process or the availability of resources, the Commission suggests that the Honourable Member contact directly the ESPON coordination unit http://www.espon.eu/main/Menu_Contact/
