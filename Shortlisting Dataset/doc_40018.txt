used to finance a part of the activities of the EASO and to supplement the funds which will be allocated to the office. However, although this is also mentioned in the financial statement accompanying the draft regulation on the establishment of EASO, the Commission has not yet taken it into consideration in the financial programming. The rapporteur expects that the financial programming accompanying the preliminary draft budget will already give a full picture of the modifications resulting from this proposal and the one concerning the creation of EASO. In this context, the rapporteur, who agrees with the creation of the EASO, considers that the proposal has no negative consequences in financial terms (its significance in terms of financial programming seems to be neutral, as the sums made available will be used in another line under Heading 3a), and recommends that the Committee on Budgets deliver a favourable opinion. CONCLUSION Taking these elements into consideration, the Committee on Budgets informs the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that, from a budgetary point of view, it sees no obstacles to the adoption of the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 573/2007/EC establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013.
