WRITTEN QUESTION E-1805/10 by Robert Goebbels (S&D) to the Commission (22 March 2010) Subject: Discriminatory treatment of EU citizens by France When selling real estate owned in France, all European Union citizens are required not only to pay capital gains tax on the property, but also to appoint an accredited representative who, in theory, must guarantee the payment of the capital gain to the French Treasury. Since it is the lawyer handling the sale who by default is required to deduct any capital gains from the sale price, the role of the accredited representative is restricted to the collection of a sum generally amounting to 1 % of the sale price. Does this obligation, which is imposed by France on foreign nationals only, not constitute a discrimination that is contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the Treaty on European Union?
