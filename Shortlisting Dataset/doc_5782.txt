The report raises several issues including: labelling and warnings, binge-drinking, "alcopops" and reducing accidents caused by drinking and driving. The report was adopted by a large majority in a show of hands. MEPs are worried about the increase in alcohol consumption among minors and young people and note a worrying trend on their part to start drinking at an ever-earlier age and, given their greater willingness to take risks, to engage in dangerous forms of behaviour such as binge drinking, other forms of hazardous alcohol consumption which aim at drunkenness, mixed consumption of alcohol and drugs, and driving whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The report calls on the Member States to pay particular attention to vulnerable social groups, such as children, young people and pregnant women, and to address the problems of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption by young people, workers and drivers by means of information and awareness-raising campaigns and, where appropriate, a review of compliance with existing national laws. EP calls for a comparative study on labelling and advertising The report points out that Member States are currently able to introduce obligatory health warnings for alcoholic beverages. The House recalls that front of pack labels may include the warnings that alcohol can cause serious health and mental health problems, that alcohol is addictive and that alcohol consumption during pregnancy may be harmful to the foetus. MEPs note that the existence of different national labelling requirements has clear implications for the EU internal market and therefore urge the Commission to initiate a comparative study on impact and effectiveness of various information and communication means, including labelling and advertising, applied in Member States with a view to reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, and to publish the results before 31 December 2009. The report calls on the Commission and Member States, with the involvement of relevant non-governmental organisations and economic associations in the context of the Health and Alcohol Forum proposed by the Commission, to encourage the exchange of proven practices, in particular with a view to preventing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption among children and young people, and to adopt the following measures: (i) to launch education campaigns to be conducted by Member States and interest groups on the risks of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, especially through school-based educational programmes directed towards children and adolescents, in particular by encouraging them to engage in regular sports activities, but also towards parents in order to prepare them to speak about alcohol-related problems within a family setting, and towards teachers; the idea of responsible and moderate consumption by adults should also be put across at an early stage, (ii) to limit the
