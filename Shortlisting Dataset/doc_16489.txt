of the latter. Key points of the report The report endorses the conclusions of the Ombudsman, namely that the Council, like every EU institution, is, in the first instance, itself responsible for the websites of its presidency and the languages used thereon. The Petitions Committee also underlines that the information on these websites should, ideally, be made available in good time in all official languages of the Community. Although, if the number of languages is to be limited, the choice of the languages used must be based on criteria of objectivity, reasonableness, transparency and manageability. The Council’s refusal to address the substance of the complainant’s request constitutes an instance of maladministration. MEPs in the committee are astonished to note that the Council does not consider itself empowered to address this question, even though it is one which affects all Member States and the Council could make recommendations to all future presidencies. The Committee regrets that the Council has avoided addressing the question of the language options of the websites of its presidencies and invites this institution to conduct a "comprehensive review" of the question. The aim is to ensure that the entire population of the European Union has easy and direct access to information on its activities. The Council should also inform Parliament of the results of its deliberations. French Presidency doing a good job The text welcomes the fact that, in contrast to the practice of past presidencies, whereby websites were only available in English, French and the language of the incumbent presidency, the French Council Presidency publishes its official website in the most widely spoken languages of the European Union (English, German, French, Italian and Spanish). MEPs urge all future Council presidencies to use in their websites the most widely spoken official languages according to an order of priority.
