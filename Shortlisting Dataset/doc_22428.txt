Reply (13 June 2005) The Council regularly raises the situation in North Caucasus with Russia as part of the intensive EU/Russia political dialogue. The specific situation in Chechnya was e.g. discussed in great detail at the first EU/Russia human rights consultations, which took place in Luxembourg on 1 March. Although the particular situation in Zumsoj has not been raised, the EU regularly expresses concerns about disappearances and the excessive use of force, including by official security forces, and the need for any suspected criminal action to be the subject of a full investigation and, if warranted, legal proceedings. In response to these concerns, Russia has confirmed that investigations and legal proceedings are underway in a number of cases.
