Reply (30 November 2009) An Extradition Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America was concluded on 28 October 2009 and will enter into force on 1 February 2010. That Agreement supplements the bilateral extradition treaties that exist between each Member State of the European Union and the United States. The (non-) extradition of nationals is a matter that is not touched upon by the EU‑US Extradition Agreement and consequently will continue to be governed exclusively by the bilateral extradition treaties between the Member States and the United States of America. Under those bilateral treaties, most Member States refuse to extradite their own nationals. The Council has no figures regarding extradition by Member States of the European Union to the United States of America.
