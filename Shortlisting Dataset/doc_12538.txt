The change in Chinese customs legislation enacted in 2003 (export controls) are producing their first results. While the Commission will review with the utmost attention the concerns of European industry, it is important to underline that the first stage in any action is to ensure that European Industry uses all the instruments provided for by European and Chinese Laws. Thus Italian hydro-sanitary taps and fittings companies should, like other creative and innovative sectors, apply for intellectual property rights (in the sector concerned, mainly trademarks, designs and patents) in Europe and/or China and when they face an infringement, ask for customs measures (retention of fake goods at borders), be it in Europe to prevent fake goods coming from third countries from entering the EU or in China to prevent fake goods from being exported (Chinese Law provides that not only imports, but also goods for export can be retained), and bring their cases to the judicial and/or administrative authorities in charge of enforcement. The affected rightholders should in this case file requests for action with the customs authorities in China and in Europe. The use of this procedure in Europe does not entail any cost.
