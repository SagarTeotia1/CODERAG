Question for written answer E-004283/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Morten Løkkegaard (ALDE) (5 May 2011) Subject: Television networks During the tendering procedure, this year, for a regional television network, the Commission decided to drop a TVNET.EU project, long in the pipeline, in which a great deal of time and money had been invested. The reason given for abandoning the project was that it would be too costly. Euronews was opted for instead, a comparable amount being involved nonetheless. Potentially, TVNET.EU's regional television network has an average of between 80 and 165 million viewers a day. Euronews, by comparison, had an average of seven million viewers a day in 2010. In the light of those figures, how does the Commission justify disregarding what TVNET.EU proposed? With regard to daily viewing figures, what is the Commission's criterion for success?
