WRITTEN QUESTION E-5889/08 by Roger Helmer (NI) to the Commission (5 November 2008) Subject: Use of traditional British (Imperial) measures The Commission will be aware that Commissioner Verheugen recently staated that the EU had no intention of banning the use of Imperial measures (pounds and ounces) in the UK. The British Government has issued advice to local councils not to prosecute traders for the offence of using traditional measures. Does the Commission agree with me that to leave a law on the statute book, but to set it aside on the basis of executive or administrative whim or discretion, tends to undermine the rule of law, to create uncertainty, and to give undue power and patronage to bureaucracies? Will the Commission now recognise the will of the British people and amend the relevant directive so as to make the right of the British people to use Imperial measures both explicit and permanent?
