Reply (17 March 2008) The Council shares the concern of the Honourable Member regarding the appointment to government positions of individuals subject to measures imposed by the UN. In its conclusions the Council has repeatedly called on the Sudanese Government to cooperate unconditionally with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and has time and again made clear that there will be no impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity. In addition, the European Union Special Representative (EUSR) for Sudan regularly addresses human rights and humanitarian issues in his numerous and high-level contacts with the Sudanese authorities, underlining the EU positions. It is in his mandate to ensure coherence between the EU's contribution to crisis management in Darfur and the overall political relationship of the EU with Sudan. Regarding the overall political context, the Council is worried about the deterioration of the situation in Sudan and in particular in Darfur, with a high risk of destabilising the region as a whole. The Council reiterated its readiness to take necessary measures, notably within a UN framework, against any party that undermines peace and security in Darfur or in the region by committing acts of violence and especially against any party that obstructs humanitarian access.
