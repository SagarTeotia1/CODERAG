policy 10. Welcomes the Commission's initiatives to promote a socially-inclusive learning society in Europe by implementing step by step the undertakings given at the Lisbon European Council, in particular as regards a European information society and innovative businesses, especially SMEs; considers that the creation of a European Research Area and the incorporation of the 'Lisbon principles' into the R&D Framework Programme constitute an essential foundation for the modernisation of the European economy, and in particular the creation of more favourable conditions for SMEs; 11. Underlines that economic, employment and social policy are three aspects of an overall policy mix strategy and assumes that the implementation of the new strategy will also strengthen employment and social policy initiatives and will put them on an equal footing with economic policy instruments in the interests of qualified and valuable jobs, long-life learning for all and greater social cohesion; 12.

Considers that in order to maintain a European model of social and economic cohesion there is a need, in a number of important sectors which involve key public services, e.g. postal services, to develop a European 'code of conduct' (in the form of a framework directive) for general interest services which should ensure the fulfilment of public obligations, the quality of services and social conditions and safeguard
