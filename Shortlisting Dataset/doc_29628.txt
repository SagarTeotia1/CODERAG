Member States. The proposed amount of the annual adjustment is therefore the consequence of salary policies in those Member States. If the crisis leads these Member States to apply lower increases or even reductions, the impact of the crisis will be reflected in the next annual adjustment (an adjustment can be positive or negative). As the method is thus sensitive to the repercussions of the crisis, albeit with a time lag, the Commission does not see a justification for further measures based on the crisis clause. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that under Article 66a of the Staff Regulations and Article 20(3) and 92 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants 2 officials as well as temporary and contract staff of the EU are subject to a so-called special levy, presently amounting to 5.07 %. A variation of increases according to the grade of officials or other servants is not foreseen, as this would, in the long run, alter salary structures in the European public service that are designed to reward merit and assuming responsibilities. 3. After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Council Regulation laying down the staff regulations of officials and the conditions of employment of other servants remains in force, as does all Community legislation. Future amendments to the Staff Regulations will be proposed on the basis of Article 336 TFEU, i.e. according to the ordinary legislative procedure.
