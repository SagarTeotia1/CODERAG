Reply (28 February 2011) With regard to the first question raised by the Honourable Member, public access to Council documents is governed by Regulation (EC) 1049/2001 of 31 May 2001 OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 43. . This instrument was adopted with the aim of giving ‘the fullest possible effect to the right of public access to documents and to lay down the general principles and limits on such access in accordance with Article 255(2) of the EC Treaty.’ Recital 4. To that end, the regulation defines principles, conditions and limits on grounds of public or private interest in disclosure. Moreover, classified information in the Council is protected in accordance with Council Decision 2001/264/EC OJ L 101, 11.4.2001, p. 1. of 19 March 2001 adopting the Council's security regulations. The Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the fact that under the abovementioned Decision, particular attention is paid to the security of all communication and information systems via which such information is handled and exchanged, as well as to the appropriate level of security clearance of officials and other personnel with access to EU classified information, as provided for in the Council's security regulations. As regards the matters covered by the other questions raised by the Honourable Member, it is Council policy not to comment on press articles.
