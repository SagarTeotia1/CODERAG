Answer given by High Representative/Vice President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (4 June 2010) The Commission concurs with the views expressed by the Honourable Member on the critical situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran and on the fact that Iran’s election to the Human Rights Council of the United Nations (UNHRC) would have been against the values on which the Council is based. The Commission was therefore glad to learn that Iran decided to withdraw its candidacy to the UNHRC at the end of April 2010, including as a consequence of international pressure against it.
