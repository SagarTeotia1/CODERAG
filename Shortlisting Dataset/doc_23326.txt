Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2010) In the impact assessment accompanying the proposal for a directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare, the Commission has estimated that cross-border healthcare represents around 1 % of public expenditure on healthcare. This estimate was broadly confirmed by the responses from Member States and other contributors to the open consultation. The Commission is informing the public on free movement of patients via the webpages ‘Cross-border healthcare http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_overview/co_operation/healthcare/cross-border_healthcare_en.htm ’ and ‘Healthcare abroad http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=509&langId=en ’ and via the Public Health Portal of the European Union http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/news/streaming/crossborder/crossborder_en.htm . Information to the public on patient mobility nevertheless remains a genuine duty of each Member State of the European Union. That is why the Commission's proposal for a directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare stipulates that the Member State of affiliation shall ensure that there are mechanisms in place to provide patients, on request, with information on receiving healthcare in another Member State, and the terms and conditions that would apply, in particular with information on patients' entitlements, on procedures for accessing those entitlements and on systems of appeal and redress. The Commission considers that the common values of all European health systems — universality, access to good quality care, equity, and solidarity — should be respected by all health systems in Europe. As the organisation of health services is under the responsibility of the Member States, it is for the Member States to provide healthcare to all their citizens. In the case that a treatment, being among the benefits of the Member State where the person concerned is insured, cannot be provided to him/her within a time limit which is medically justified, that person has the right to get an authorisation for treatment in another Member State and to receive benefits in kind there in accordance with the provisions of the legislation of that other Member State, as though the person was insured under that legislation. This already existing right of patients to receive planned treatment abroad is enshrined in the regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 OJ L 028, 30.1.1997 , p. 1. on the application of social security schemes (to be replaced by Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 OJ L 200, 7.6.2004 , p. 1. on the coordination of social security systems in May 2010). The proposal for a directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare will not affect this right.
