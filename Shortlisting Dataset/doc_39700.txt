in a society based on the rule of law and mutual respect. Complementarity and joint responsibility are the best tools for enabling Mediterranean diversity to flourish in such a way as to contribute to a prosperity in which all citizens can share. 8.4.2010 OPINION of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for the Committee on Foreign Affairs on Union for the Mediterranean ( 2009/2215(INI) ) Rapporteur: Niki Tzavela SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy calls on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: Introduction 1. Wishes the Union for the Mediterranean Summit on 7 and 8 June 2010 in Barcelona to show the EU’s continuing support for closer cooperation with its Southern Mediterranean partners on the optimisation of national support schemes; the development of common positions on regulatory issues in the energy field, with the help of the Association of Mediterranean Regulators for Electricity and Gas (MEDREG) and the Euro-Mashreq Gas Centre; trans-Mediterranean cooperation on renewable energy; and the exchange of best practices and technological progress through initiatives and partnerships such as the Barcelona Process, the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Euro-Maghreb Energy Community Treaty and the MED-ENEC programme on energy efficiency in the construction sector; Infrastructure and supply 2. Supports the promotion of trans-Euro-Mediterranean interconnections in the electricity, gas and oil sectors in order to improve energy supply security; emphasises the importance of completing the Mediterranean electricity loop and supports the development of a southern gas corridor; encourages the use of reverse flows where it is justified in terms of security, cost-effectiveness and viability; Solar and wind energy 3. Underlines the fact that the Mediterranean has enormous, and largely untapped, potential in the field of renewable energies such as solar energy, wind energy and hydropower; 4. Calls for strong support for the Mediterranean Solar Plan (MSP) as it aims to increase the use of solar energy and other renewable energy sources for power generation to an ambitious target of 20 GW of additional installed capacity by 2020 and to bring about energy savings of 20% around the Mediterranean; 5. Emphasises the further significance of the MSP for the Southern Mediterranean countries’ economic development, in terms of providing additional domestic electricity capacity, reinforcing grid infrastructures and underpinning the creation of a new industrial sector of solar components manufacturing (with associated jobs), and calls, in this regard, for a practical action plan to be produced on the basis of the strategy paper; 6. Notes that a number of industrial initiatives in the Mediterranean region (such as DESERTEC) have the potential to impact positively on energy security, the environment, sustainable development and the growth of energy networks, and calls for practical steps to be taken towards their realisation; emphasises, at the same time, that such projects should generate direct added value for the local societies in which they are based by activating local stakeholders, facilitating technology transfer and enabling the development of efficient networks and infrastructures that also lend themselves to local use, thus boosting the local economy, contributing
