Question for written answer P-004751/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Agnès Le Brun (PPE) (11 May 2011) Subject: Voluntary depigmentation Over the past 30 or so years, a relatively dangerous type of cosmetic treatment entailing the voluntary depigmentation of the skin using various beauty products has spread among a certain number of black Europeans and foreigners living in the EU. The poor quality and toxicity of some of these products has led to serious health problems among users. This practice is spreading to a dangerous degree and is beginning to look like an addiction. It is therefore a major public health issue. 1. Is the Commission looking into this phenomenon? Is there data on the incidence of this practice among European residents? 2. Are measures planned to combat this practice, or at least its consequences?
