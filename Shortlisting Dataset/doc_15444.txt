2002/C 205 E/210 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0715/02 by Guido Podestà (PPE-DE) and Raffaele Lombardo (PPE-DE) to the Commission (15 March 2002) Subject: Children's rights and gay couples In Norway gay couples may adopt the children which their partners have had in previous relationships. The Swedish Government is currently preparing a bill to extend the right to adopt children to homosexual couples. There have also been repeated requests from gay couples for artificial insemination. This important issue raises the question of the effective protection of children's rights, which must be given precedence over the rights of couples, as officially laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted at Nice. The Charter's provisions on the protection of family life lay special emphasis on the protection of children's rights. The Commission: — Would it agree that research work, statistical surveys and assessments should be carried out into the development, in psychological and mental terms as well as from the point of view of socialisation, of children who are brought up in homosexual families, as is already the case in certain countries? — Does it not consider that surveys should be conducted to ascertain whether the role which parents should play with a view to the healthy development of their children's personality can be taken on by gay couples?
