Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (13 April 2010) The mechanism for reclaiming VAT has entirely changed with the entering into force of Council Directive 2008/9/EC of 12 February 2008 laying down detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in Directive 2006/112/EC, to taxable persons not established in the Member State of refund but established in another Member State OJ L44, 20.2.2008, p. 23. . 1. The Commission is in close contact with the Member States on the various problems and issues in relation to the implementation of the directive, both formally and informally, such as via the Standing Committee for Administrative Cooperation (SCAC), and the Sub-Committee for Information Technology (SCIT) and various workshops and technical channels. 2. Although the system works in a majority of cases, the Commission is aware that two Member States have not yet an available web portal. 3. This situation is not acceptable but the Commission is making every possible effort to resolve these issues within the parameters of what is legally permissible taking into account that these problems are entirely within the competence of the Member States. 4. As to the suggestion to reintroduce the former paper-based procedure, the Commission draws the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that the corresponding legal base (the so-called ‘Eighth Directive’ Eighth Council Directive 79/1072/EEC of 6 December 1979 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Arrangements for the refund of value added tax to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country (OJ L 331, 27.12.1979, p. 11). ) is no longer applicable. 5. If no corrective action is taken by the Member States concerned, the Commission, acting in its role of guardian of the Treaties, would consider launching formal infringement proceedings.
