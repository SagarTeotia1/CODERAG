17.10.1989, p. 23. on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities. This directive is commonly known as the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive. The legal basis chosen was Article 57(2) of the former EC Treaty (now Article 47 in the consolidated version of the Treaties), which concerns facilitating access to self-employed activities, on the basis that television broadcasting constitutes a service. This directive is of crucial importance not only from the point of view of its economic repercussions on the sectors concerned but chiefly, in my view, because of its pioneering role at Community level: (a) in Chapter V, on the protection of minors against harmful content in programmes and against advertising which might be prejudicial to their integral development; (b) in Chapter VI, which recognises the right of reply for people whose rights have been harmed by an incorrect assertion in a television programme. Directive 89/552/EEC was amended by Directive 97/36/EC of 30 June 1997 OJ L 202, 30.7.1997, p. 60 with the aim of taking account of both technological and market developments, and it was rounded off by Directive 2000/31/EC of 8 June 2000 OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1. on electronic commerce in the internal market. Nevertheless, the first text to deal with matters linked to the protection of minors and human dignity in audiovisual and information services offered to the public at Community level, whatever form of delivery is involved, was Council Recommendation 98/560/EC of 24 September 1998 OJ L 270, 7.10.1998, p. 48. on the development of the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information services industry, pursuant to Article 157 of the EC Treaty. The application of Recommendation 98/560/EC in the Member States was evaluated by the Commission first in 2000 and subsequently in 2003 in two evaluation reports COM(2001)106 of 27.2.2001 and COM(2003)776 of 12.12.2003. . In view of the results and suggestions outlined in these evaluation reports and in public consultation on Directive 97/36/EC of 30 June 1997 amending Directive 89/552/EEC (‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive), the Commission has submitted the present proposal for a recommendation with the aim of complementing Recommendation 98/560/EC and updating it to take account of the huge technological progress made since then and the great proliferation of illicit and harmful content distributed every day through all the media, particularly radio, television and the Internet. II - ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSAL FOR A RECOMMENDATION On initial consideration, your draftswoman takes the view that this proposal for a recommendation represents a step forward by comparison with Recommendation 98/560/EC and provides a complement to it in that it recommends that the Member States, audiovisual and information services industries and other parties concerned: (a) guarantee that any person has the right of reply to inaccurate information disseminated through any type of medium which might harm their legitimate interests; (b) promote information media education programmes designed to enable parents, teachers and trainers to teach minors to make proper use of the information media; (c) avoid any discrimination based on sex,
