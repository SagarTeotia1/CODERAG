Question for written answer P-003998/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (20 April 2011) Subject: Directive 2010/63/EU: exact proportion of inspections without prior warning Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes entered into force on 10 November 2010. Article 34 of the directive relates to the inspections of breeders, suppliers, and users which Member States are required to carry out in order to verify compliance with its requirements; paragraph 4 of that article stipulates that ‘An appropriate proportion of the inspections shall be carried out without prior warning’. Bearing in mind that it approved the directive on 22 September 2010, can the Commission explain what it means by an ‘appropriate proportion’ of inspections to be carried out without prior warning and specify their actual extent?
