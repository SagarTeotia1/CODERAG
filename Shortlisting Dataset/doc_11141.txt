Question for written answer E-4815/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Fiorello Provera (EFD) (30 June 2010) Subject: Disbanding private militias in the Philippines On 16 June 2010, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), announced that it wanted the newly elected president, Benigno S. Aquino III, to bring to an end the government's policy of ‘nurturing warlords’ if it wants to bring an end to media killings. The vice-chairman of the NUJP, Nonoy Espina, told the Filipino news service ABS-CBN that ‘government after government after government has [sic] nurtured warlords, allowed them to grow so strong that they practically ruled their provinces like their personal kingdoms’. In Maguindanao province on 23 November 2009, a private militia working on behalf of the governing family massacred 57 people, including 30 journalists. President Aquino has promised action on the problems plaguing the country, such as corruption, and, according to the Associated Press, he said he would set up a ‘commission to investigate allegations of corruption and other wrongdoing’ which occurred during the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, ‘whose nine-year presidency was wracked by four coup attempts by mutinous troops and by opposition impeachment bids over alleged election fraud, corruption and human rights abuses’. What steps is the Council prepared to take to support President Aquino’s efforts to stamp out corruption and private militias that pose a serious threat to democracy in the Philippines?
