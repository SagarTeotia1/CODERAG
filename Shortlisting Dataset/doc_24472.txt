reference to productivity developments specifies the need for Social partners to adopt a responsible course when negotiating wages. (Amendment 6 ) Recommendation 3.1 (iii) (wage developments) (iii) national labour institutions and collective bargaining systems, respecting the autonomy of social partners, take into account the relationship between wage developments and labour market conditions, thereby allowing an evolution of wages according to productivity developments and skills differentials , in order to guarantee the EU's competitiveness and to improve employment across skills and geographical areas. (iii) national labour institutions and collective bargaining systems, respecting the autonomy of social partners, take into account the relationship between wage developments and labour market conditions, thereby allowing an evolution of wages according to productivity and capable of taking into account the investment in enhancement of the human factor , in order to guarantee the EU's competitiveness and to improve employment across skills and geographical areas. The Social Partners Summit which is intended to be convened every year preceding the Spring European Councils can play a positive role in this. The Commission, the Council, and the social partners should contribute to improve the macro-economic dialogue by a combination of productivity oriented wage policies and a financial policy designed to strengthen economic recovery, so that both elements support the push for full employment.

But stability alone does not by itself create sustainable growth. Moreover, the achievement of stability and growth needs new opportunities within public and private investment expenditure in a wider sense (e.g. infrastructure, research, data highways, education and training).
