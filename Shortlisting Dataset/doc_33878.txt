WRITTEN QUESTION E-4032/08 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (15 July 2008) Subject: Assisting the investigation of sudden deaths in other Member States I am contacted on a regular basis by the relatives of people who have died suddenly in other Member States, on holidays or on business and as a result of accidents, natural causes or murders. According to statistics recently obtained by the Labour Party in the Irish Parliament, 322 Irish people have died in Spain over the past five years, 39 in Italy, 34 in France, 26 in Germany, 23 in Greece, and 23 in Portugal. Some of these relatives say that they have difficulty in establishing the cause of death of their loved ones or have concerns about the retention of organs. Could the Commission indicate whether it will examine the possibility of taking an initiative in this area so as to assist the relatives, possibly through the establishment of dedicated offices and contact points in all Member States with a mandate to provide legal and financial support to such relatives?
