Answer given by Mr Monti on behalf of the Commission (10 March 2004) The Commission is not aware of any British proposal to grant industrial customers a ten per cent State subsidy on electricity prices that the Honourable Member refers to in his written question. The Commission is watching developments in the energy market with all due attention. It will request information from the United Kingdom authorities to investigate the alleged subsidy. The Commission will not fail to take appropriate action if infringements of the relevant Community legislation are discovered. All due attention would be given to any more detailed information on such proposals that the Honourable Member might provide to the Commission.
