ORAL QUESTION H-0206/02 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Harlem Désir to the Council Subject: Taxation of international currency transactions What action does the Council intend to take on the Commission document of 13 February 2002 entitled 'Reponses to the challenges of globalisation', with particular reference to the issue of the taxation of international currency transactions, the proceeds from which would be allocated to development aid? Is it aware of the study which the German Government commissioned Professor Spahn to conduct, which concludes that an OECD country or a group of countries could introduce such a tax unilaterally? Is it aware that the French National Assembly has adopted a provision of the 2002 finance act which supports the introduction of such a tax once the Council has endorsed the idea? Does the Presidency intend to enter this issue on the agenda for the Seville European Council meeting with a view to considering the political action that might be taken to secure broader support both within the Union and around the world for a tax of this kind?
