Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (22 March 2011) The Commission agrees with the distinction between ‘evasion’ and ‘avoidance’ as mentioned by the Honourable Member. The same distinction is used in the Reckon study http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/tax_cooperation/combating_tax_fraud/reckon_report_sep2009.pdf that is the source for the estimation of 12 % of VAT gap, which includes both avoidance and evasion. The Commission recently launched a debate on the VAT system with the publication of the Green Paper on the future of VAT COM(2010)695 final. . The objective is that this debate will culminate in an agreement on changes that can lead to a simpler, more robust and efficient VAT system. A more harmonised VAT system with fewer exemptions will be less vulnerable to some forms of tax avoidance. Therefore, the Commission believes that it is also possible to suggest legal changes that would make the schemes for this tax avoidance less attractive or even impossible.
