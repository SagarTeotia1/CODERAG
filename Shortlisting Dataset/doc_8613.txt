2004/C 70 E/063 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1754/03 by Elisabeth Schroedter (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (27 May 2003) Subject: Bridge linking the island of Rügen with the mainland, question E-0543/03 In my question E-0543/03 OJ C 242 E, 9.10.2003, p. 144 . of 28 February 2003 I drew to the Commission's attention the project to construct a high-level bridge linking the island of Rügen with the mainland. The reason for my question was my concern that protected areas forming part of Europe's natural heritage could be permanently encroached upon using ERDF money. In its answer the Commission informed me that the financing of the bridge did not fall within the Commission's responsibility, as the German authorities had not requested assistance for the project under EU funds. The implementation report on the OP in respect of the ERDF (infrastructure) shows expenditure of EUR 23 400 for the B96n (new construction), part of which relates to the Rügen bridge. The Minister of Economic Affairs for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern indicated, during a discussion with citizens on 2 April 2003 in Bergen, that the authorities did not propose to submit an individual application for financing for the bridge to the Commission but an overall application for transport projects in general. 1. (a) Is the Commission aware that ERDF money has already gone into the above project? (b) What is the Commission's view of the provision of such assistance in the light of the circumstances set out in my last question (fact that there is no need for the bridge, implausible financing plan, damage to nature, bridge to stand in the middle of a route linking European protection areas for migratory birds and seabirds)? 2. (a) What is the Commission's view of the wish of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern authorities to submit an overall application? (b) Does the Commission intend to agree to such an application? If so, will it ensure that projects included in it are adequately examined? 3. Has the Commission concluded, following its examination of the relevant documents, that the Federal Republic of Germany is fulfilling its obligations under Council Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 . of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora?
