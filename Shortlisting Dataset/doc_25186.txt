non-Community fishing grounds, on the basis of the principle of responsible fishing; 10. Calls also on the Council and Commission to focus, within the international dimension of the CFP, on the need to establish relations with non-member Mediterranean countries, allocating adequate human and financial resources to that end, in order to speed up the launch of a process to harmonise the management and exploitation of common resources, so as to avoid further penalising Community fishing, depletion of stocks, job losses and an increase in imported fisheries products, without any impact on the environment; 11. Agrees with the Council and the Commission on the need to fight illegal fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience or no flag at all, on the basis of severe penalties for countries sheltering such vessels and support for the initiatives of certain international organisations in combating the phenomenon; calls for much more stringent monitoring and penalties; 12. Calls on the Commission to submit initiatives within the various RFOs with a view to standardising offences and penalties, as well as closer coordination in monitoring fishing activities, with the aim of preventing the appearance on the Community market of the catches of vessels which have not respected the rules on stock conservation and rational stock management; 13. Calls on the Commission to reduce the time-limits for transposition into Community law of the agreements adopted by the RFOs, while improving its own procedures, preparing the Community's positions in suitable fashion with full involvement of the sector; stresses the need for Parliament to be consulted regularly on the issues debated by the RFOs and the negotiation of international agreements, in the interests of effective participation in the decision-making process; 14. Calls on the European Union to encourage the creation of joint ventures with third countries, since these are an effective instrument for developing local fisheries sectors via transfers of know-how and technology, job creation, training and research, while also contributing to the social and economic development of the developing countries, supplying the Community market and the preservation of the fleet; calls, therefore, for the integration of such measures into the principle of Community preference; 15. Insists on the need to guarantee the fundamental labour rights of all fishermen (fair pay, safety, proper rest periods, union representation, welfare benefits and collective negotiation of labour contracts); calls on the Commission, accordingly, to promote greater social dialogue with a view to the creation of better-quality jobs and the drawing-up of a Statute for Fishermen which would take account of the specific characteristics of their occupation; 16. Calls for further scientific research to determine the real situation of each species and current trends affecting it, with the full involvement of the sector, the aim being to ensure the rational management of the fishing grounds in which the Community fleet operates; 17. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
