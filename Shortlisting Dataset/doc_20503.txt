Question for written answer E-010668/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Astrid Lulling (PPE) and Struan Stevenson (ECR) (18 November 2011) Subject: Discriminatory treatment in relation to excise duties on spirits Under European Directives 92/83/EEC OJ L 316, 31.10.1992, p. 21. and 92/84/EEC OJ L 316, 31.10.1992, p. 29. , all spirits are supposed to be subject to the same rate of excise duty. It appears, however, that some Member States are applying reduced rates of duty to domestic products. Greece — citing Directive 92/83/EEC — applies to ouzo a rate of excise duty which is around 50 % of the rate of excise duty applied to other spirits. Without any legal justification, this favourable rate has been extended to tsipouro, another locally-produced spirit, to the detriment of spirits produced in other Member States. What are the legal grounds for this discriminatory treatment, which obstructs the smooth operation of the single market, and what measures does the Commission intend to take to rectify the situation? In September 2011, Hungary raised the excise duty rate on flavoured spirits by 50 %, but raised the duty rate on pálinka, a locally-produced fruit-based spirit, by only 5 %. Does not this unequal treatment of spirits as regards excise duty rates run counter to the objectives of Directives 92/83/EEC and 92/84/EEC, which provide for the same rate of excise duty to be applied to all spirits which fall into the same category and are therefore in direct competition with each other?
