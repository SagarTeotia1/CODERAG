the Commission has provided a sound framework, but proposes amendments to make the procedures clearer, more effective, more transparent and in compliance with better regulation practice. In this context, the operation of the comitology procedure will be critical, as it will be responsible for deciding which parts will be included in which category for a pan-European Type-Approval. It will be important to ensure that the decisions that will be taken will strive to achieve a fair balance between the interests of safety, the environment, consumers and manufacturers. Overall, your Rapporteur is very supportive of this proposal and considers that it completes the Internal Market acquis for a very important economic sector.
