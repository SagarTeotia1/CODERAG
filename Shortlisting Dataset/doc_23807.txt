ensure the full involvement of women in planning and decision-making on Information Society policies and control and management of the ICT and media sector; 3. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pay particular attention to women at risk of being excluded from the benefits of the Information Society, such as older women, unemployed and low-income women, migrant women, women belonging to ethnic minorities and women with disabilities, in order to prevent the emergence of a two-speed society and to give them the opportunity to participate in easily accessible ITC courses in their home localities; 4. Urges the Commission to collect systematic data on structural differences in the ICT sector broken down by gender in the sectors of education and the labour market (education level and type of education, type of jobs and level of seniority, grades and wages); 5. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement gender equality policies, that aim especially to vocational training, life long learning, compatibility between professional and private life and the equal division of family responsibilities between men and women, which will facilitate women's participation in the Informatιon Society; 6. Calls the Commission and the Member States to undertake the commitment - with the full use of Structural Funds and in particular the Social Fund - for training in ICT, particularly with regard to entry or return to the job market (unemployed women, initiatives for re-training, always in the context of the Lisbon objective for the employment participation rate), 7. Calls on the Member States to encourage the inclusion of ITC into primary schooling from an early age, thus giving girls a more natural relationship to ITC, counteracting the gender-stereotypical attitude to ITC which may occur later in life; 8. Calls for access to ICT to be affordable; 9. Calls on the Council and the Commission to continue existing gender mainstreaming policies and initiatives for confronting the under-representation of women in education in the fields of ICT; 10. Calls the Commission and the Member States to undertake the commitment for: a) integrate specific ICT training for women within a broader process of cooperation between all the parties concerned: the education authorities and organisations, school and vocational guidance, the private and public sector, the training organisations, the lenders of capital, the central and/or regional and/or local authorities, equal opportunities organisations, undertakings, women's groups or associations; b) reorganise the school, university and vocational guidance services in such a way that they seek out rather than wait to be approached by the people concerned and encourage the participation of girls in higher education, particularly in technical and technological fields c) encourage the participation of women and girls in specific ICT training courses by providing more decentralised and more widely distributed education and training facilities; d) develop awareness and information measures so as to offer women and those around them images of women engaged in non-traditional activities, particularly those related to ICT activities e) encourage greater participation by girls in the various initial vocational training systems outside the school education system, especially ITC apprenticeships and
