Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (1 April 2008) Directive 2004/22/EC OJ L 135, 30.4.2004. of Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on measuring instruments has been applicable from 30 October 2006. Given the recent applicability it does not seem probable that instruments conforming to the directive are concerned by the report the Honourable Member quotes. On the issue of subsidiarity raised by the Honourable Member, it should be noted that the directive harmonises the requirements for placing on the market and putting into use of measuring instruments within its scope. This includes gas meters if they are subject to legal metrological control. The directive defines putting into use as meaning the first use of an instrument for the purposes for which it was intended, and the harmonised requirements are necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the Internal Market. The directive does not cover aspects relating to the periodic verification of measuring instruments in use as these do not have an impact on the functioning of the Internal Market. As a consequence, the regular testing of measuring instruments to ascertain that they work properly, or need replacement, continues to be a competence of Member States. Issues related to these in-service controls are therefore dealt with under national law. It should also be noted that the directive allows a 10 year transition period until 29 October 2016 during which period instruments may be put into use based on valid type approvals complying with national laws that were in force until 30 October 2006. Such instruments will probably not meet the requirements of the Measuring Instruments Directive. End-users are, of course, free to demand from a supplier that a new meter complies with the directive, i. e. meters that are CE + M marked, but this is not a right that can be enforced upon suppliers under the directive before 30 October 2016 in the case of new meters.
