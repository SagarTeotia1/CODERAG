WRITTEN QUESTION E-4864/06 by Ignasi Guardans Cambó (ALDE) to the Commission (10 November 2006) Subject: Support to the cinematographic industry through the tax relief system in the United Kingdom At present, in the United Kingdom, a reform of the Finance Bill is currently being debated. The Finance Bill establishes in its Chapter 3, Part 3 that only eligible expenditure incurred in the United Kingdom will qualify for a tax relief. This requirement could imply that an US film productions (or US/UK co-productions) produced in the United Kingdom would benefit from a tax relief, while British co-productions produced elsewhere in the European Union would not receive these tax breaks. Does the European Commission consider this regulation compatible with the European Competition law? If so, and having regard to the Communication of the European Commission on certain legal aspects relating to cinematographic and other audiovisual works which considers that European ‘cinematographic works face strong competition from outside Europe’, is this unequal treatment of European productions acceptable in the light of the task of promoting cultural diversity in the EU pursuant to Article 151 of the EU Treaty? In that case, which measures will the Commission take under the EU Treaty and, in particular, under EU competition law in such a case?
