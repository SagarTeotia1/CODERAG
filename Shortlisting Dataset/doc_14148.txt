WRITTEN QUESTION E-2908/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (22 April 2009) Subject: Information on the use of subsidies for the ‘Europe Direct Information Network’ by the municipality of Bari Numerous financing programmes have been developed for the Community programming period 2007‑13; with these programmes the European Union intends to support projects under various sectoral policies. In this regard, the Commission has issued a call for proposals to select organisations that are eligible for an annual action and technical assistance grant to accommodate public information centres. The municipality of Bari (Puglia, Italy) requires funding in order to promote active, informed European citizenship, thereby helping to achieve the general objectives of the EU. In the light of the above, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Bari has submitted an application to accommodate a Europe Direct centre? If it has, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Bari has obtained the grants and whether they have been used in the correct way and within the proper time frame or whether they have had to be reimbursed?
