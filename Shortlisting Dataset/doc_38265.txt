70bn Euro. The rapporteur strongly encourages the Commission to work with the Member States to establish a co-operation and benchmarking system to combat tax fraud and unfair tax competition. Furthermore the European Parliament has repeatedly invited the Member States to redirect their expenditures towards productive investments. A co-ordinated investment in the future strategy of the EU and all Member States with a co-ordinated mobilisation of private sector investments, which is an integral part of the Lisbon strategy, will make a difference and give a considerable push to growth in the EU. Underinvestment in education, training, research and development in the EU stems in particular from the very low contribution from the private sector in comparison with the USA. There is an increased need to set up a new kind of public-private partnership in education and training, research and development, improving innovation and investing in transeuropean networks. The European Union needs to develop a coherent industrial policy, preventing the transfer of R&D centres outside of the EU, focusing on new, environmentally friendly, highly productive technologies and renewable energy and providing particular support to SMEs. The rapporteur suggests a number of measures for Member States and the EU to improve the framework conditions, increase financial incentives and provide financial market guarantees to support to the private sector, but at the same time she also calls on the private sector to take up its responsibility and to increase its financial participation in the above mentioned investments in the future as well as to take up its social corporate responsibility to improve the quality of jobs in particularly in SMEs.
