and human dignity in the media, and to supporting the creation of a media environment appropriate for citizens’ social, educational and cultural needs. The Commission intends to use the findings of this group to launch a public consultation on the different issues referred to above and to possibly report on the results of the consultation in a communication on the subject. As far as awareness-raising activities are concerned, some initiatives have already been undertaken by the European awareness network which is coordinated by Insafe and co-funded by the European Commission under the Safer Internet Programme. Out of the current 23 national nodes which are members of this network, at least one third are in close dialogue with the games production and distribution industry, games researchers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the national children’s ombudsman (e.g. in Spain). Nodes work together to exchange information, and several actively contribute to the development of the PEGI system, which holds a central place in all awareness-raising campaigns. By raising the interest of national media through press releases, several nodes have taken part in television (TV) and press interviews on the dangers of violent/racist games and are even acting as multipliers by disseminating information to other organisations. Some nodes, for example Finland, Norway, Spain and Belgium, have developed educational packages and/or games which touch on the issue of violent and racist games amongst other things.
