P5_TA(2001)0513 Pre-contractual information on home loans A5-0290/2001 European Parliament resolution on the Commission recommendation on pre-contractual information to be given to consumers by lenders offering home loans ( C5-0256/2001 - 2001/2121(COS) ) The European Parliament, - having regard to the Commission recommendation (C(2001) 477 - C5-0256/2001 ) OJ L 69, 10.3.2001, p. 25. , - having regard to the Financial Services Action Plan ( COM(1999) 232 ), - having regard to the Commission's third report on financial services priorities and progress ( COM(2000) 692 ), - having regard to the European agreement on a Voluntary Code of Conduct on pre-contractual information for home loans (the 'Code'), - having regard to Rule 47(1) of its Rules of Procedure, - having regard to the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ( A5-0290/2001 ), A. whereas the Code covers both domestic and cross-border loans, with the exception of credit agreements coming under Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning consumer credit OJ L 42, 12.2.1987, p. 48. as last amended by Directive 98/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council OJ L 101, 1.4.1998, p. 17. , B. whereas the completion of the internal market for financial services is a Community priority for the next few years, and must be a matter both for business and for consumers, C. whereas consumer protection is structured very differently from one Member State to another, D. whereas market integration and an enhanced cross-border supply of financial products and services must not lead to a lesser degree of consumer protection, E. whereas the harmonisation of provisions, taking into account the different civil law systems, seems neither desirable nor realistic in the foreseeable future, F. whereas the legal position of consumers must therefore be improved by other means, in particular by means of greater product transparency and the introduction of obligations to provide pre-contractual information, G. whereas the market participants themselves are best placed to negotiate proper solutions to ensure an appropriate balance of interests between the contractual parties, H. whereas voluntary agreements between banks and consumers' associations have only limited options with regard to penalties, and whereas they must therefore be supplemented by effective monitoring mechanisms so as to ensure that they are complied with, I. whereas the Commission recommendation is of considerable significance in this context, in particular with regard to the establishment of a central register and ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the recommendation, including the possibility of binding legislation being adopted should the recommendation not be fully complied with, 1.
