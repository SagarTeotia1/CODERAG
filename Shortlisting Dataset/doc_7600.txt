Question for written answer E-004075/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (3 May 2011) Subject: Use of mercury in Europe Despite the fact that mercury is recognised as toxic, it is still used in dental fillings, as well as for other medical applications and in laboratory instruments, such as thermometers. Europe banned the use of mercury in barometers in 2007, but these other uses, particularly in dentistry, are still with us. 1. What is the current situation with regard to the use of mercury in dentistry (fillings) and of other medical uses, including laboratory instruments, in Europe? 2. Is the EU seeking to ban, as Norway, Sweden and Denmark already have, the use of dental fillings which contain mercury, amongst other heavy metals such as silver and tin, in view of the potential implications for human health, and particularly for pregnant women and women of child-bearing age? 3. What measures is it considering taking against the use of mercury in medicine and in laboratory instruments in Europe?
