Answer given by Mr Marín on behalf of the Commission (14 April 1999) There are currently no plans to hold a Community-India high level meeting on the environment. Environmental issues are, however, discussed regularly in the framework of Community-India cooperation, as was the case recently in the meetings of the sub-commission on development and of the joint commission that took place on 13 and 14 January 1999, respectively. As a follow-up to the joint commission meeting, bilateral discussions are under way on the establishment of a number of working groups of experts, including a working group on the environment. Environment has been designated as one of the three main areas of the cooperation programme with India, in addition to primary education and basic health. This is in line with the Commission's communication on an EU India Enhanced Partnership COM(96) 275 final. . Furthermore, the Commission has in recent months made proposals to the Indian side to deepen the bilateral dialogue and cooperation on the environment, also as part of the Commission's endeavour to promote exchanges on soft security issues. The Commission specifically raised the environment at the last Community India annual ministerial (Troika) meeting at New Delhi on 13 November 1998, proposing to organise jointly a Community-India conference on the environment as a first step towards a new partnership on the environment .
