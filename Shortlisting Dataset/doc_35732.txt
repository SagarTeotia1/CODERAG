Answer given by Ms. Reding on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2012) In May 2011, the Commission presented a package of measures aimed at strengthening the rights of victims of crime, including a directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims and a regulation on the mutual recognition of civil law protection measures which complements the directive on the European Protection Order. Both instruments are currently being negotiated through the co-decision procedure and the Commission hopes that they will be adopted in 2012. In accordance with the Council's 2011 Roadmap for strengthening the rights and protection of victims, in particular in criminal proceedings, the Commission is currently researching on further actions to improve the situation of crime victims in the EU.
