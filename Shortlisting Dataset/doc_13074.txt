Question for written answer E-010020/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antigoni Papadopoulou (S&D) (7 November 2011) Subject: Violation of human rights in Turkey (cases of a young boy and students) The Turkish daily ‘ Milliyet ’ has reported that a prosecutor in Adana has asked for a three-year prison sentence for a boy who had been arrested for stealing 13 pears, without taking into consideration whether he stole from hunger or poverty. Besides, another Turkish daily, ‘ Cumhuriyet ’, has reported another serious case, namely the fact that some 500 students are still detained in Turkey while no mention of the matter was made in the Commission’s progress report for Turkey for 2011. Commission representative Marc Pierini has said that he would check whether the matter was omitted when drawing up the final version of the report or in the draft prepared in Ankara. Can the Commission state: 1. whether it finds it acceptable to impose a three-year prison term on a minor; 2. how it can accept such rulings from a candidate country that aspires to join the EU and to play a leading role in social and legal affairs; 3. how it explains the fact that no mention of the matter of detained students was made in the latest progress report for Turkey; 4. what its intentions are with regard to these students, and how it intends to deal with these matters so as to ensure the release of any minors wrongfully detained on the one hand, and, on the other, to make sure that such practices are immediately altered so that Turkey can continue to be a deserving candidate for EU membership?
