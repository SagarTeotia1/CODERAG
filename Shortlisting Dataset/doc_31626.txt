WRITTEN QUESTION E-7053/08 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (9 January 2009) Subject: Wood impregnation plants in Greece According to the Commission's answer to my previous Question E‑6098/07, ‘wood impregnation plants with a solvent consumption of more than 25 tonnes per year have to comply with the requirements of Council Directive 1999/13/EC OJ L 85, 29.3.1991, p. 1 . of 11 March 1999 on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations … All installations falling under the scope of this directive should either be authorised or registered … The directive sets limits for the emissions of VOC caused by wood impregnation. The fugitive VOC emissions from such activities should not be higher than 45 % of the solvent input, or the total emissions … should not be more than 11 kg per cubic metre of impregnated wood.’ What is the Commission's appraisal of the application of Directive 1999/13/EC in Greece? How many wood impregnation plants are there in Greece? Are they all authorised? What data does the Commission have on VOC emissions from wood impregnation plants in Greece?
