Question for written answer E-001717/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michael Cramer (Verts/ALE) (2 March 2011) Subject: TEN‑T funding of studies on a fixed Fehmarn Belt crossing between Lübeck and Puttgarden (measure 2007‑DE‑20010‑S) Under the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN‑T) programme, provision has been made for the funding of studies on a fixed crossing between Lübeck and Puttgarden (measure 2007‑DE‑20010‑S). In the context of the mid‑term review of TEN‑Ts, the Commission stated in October 2010 that it would only be possible to respect the already extended deadline for the measure if the final route for the German hinterland rail link was decided on by the end of 2010. On 7 February 2011 the German Government stated, in response to a question from a Member of the Bundestag, Dr Konstantin von Notz, that significant delays were occurring in the individual phases of the work and a final decision on the route therefore could not be taken in 2010, but a precise assessment of the impact of these delays had not yet been made. 1. What consequences will the failure to decide on the final route of the German hinterland rail link, as called for, by the end of 2010 have for support for the measure from TEN‑T funds? 2. What consequences will the German Government's simultaneous admission that significant delays are occurring have for support for the measure from TEN‑T funds? 3. What steps will the Commission be taking in respect of the measure in question against the background of the mid‑term review?
