ORAL QUESTION H-0622/03 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Ioannis Patakis to the Commission Subject: Statements by Commissioner David Byrne on ending the ban on GMOs Statements by Commissioner David Byrne that it would be necessary to end the five-year ban on most GMOs by the end of this year have caused serious concern. He indicated that he was in favour of authorising the use of a new type of genetically modified product, BT11 sweet maize, produced by the Swiss ‘Syngenta AG’ company and of examining another type of modified maize produced by the American Monsanto company. Are we in fact one step away from overturning bans and restrictions on GMOs in the EU Member States, chiefly as a result of intense pressure from the USA, a measure which will have incalculable consequences on the health of consumers and the environment, as demonstrated by an increasing number of scientific studies, while, at the same time, making farmers dependent on the interests of three or four, chiefly American, multinationals?
