Answer given by Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (12 August 2010) In response to questions 1 and 2, the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) is currently providing funding to twelve international humantiarian agencies who are delivering direct assistance to returning populations in Northern Sri Lanka Implementation of these projects is underway. Any issues or concerns that may arise are directly raised with the Government of Sri Lanka either at Colombo- or Brussels level, with whom we maintain regular contact. As regards the plight of the Tamil fisherman and all other citizens of Sri Lanka, the EU considers that the consequences of the conflict need to be put in the context of our long-term goal, which is to ensure that Sri Lanka upholds its democratic principles and continues on its path to become a stable, secure and economically prosperous country. This includes finding an inclusive lasting political solution to the root causes of the conflict, with the genuine participation of all ethnic and religious communities and stakeholders. The European Commission continues to use all opportunities to urge the Government and all communities in Sri Lanka to make concrete efforts to overcome the divisions of the past and to achieve genuine reconciliation.
