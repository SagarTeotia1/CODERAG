Question for written answer E-005108/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (24 May 2011) Subject: Forced prostitution A new forced prostitution phenomenon is posing a threat to Europe. So-called ‘loverboys’ ensnare young women and girls from all sections of society, use violence and drugs to pressure them into submission and force them into prostitution. The — native — victims are becoming younger and younger. The perpetrators, mostly immigrants from Africa and the Middle East, make use of the latest media as well as old modi operandi. Whilst the victims of forced prosecution previously came mainly from the fringes of society, ‘loverboys’ seek out their victims in all sections of society, targeting women aged between 11 and 35, often well‑educated. 1. Is the Commission aware of this form of forced prostitution? 2. If so, are there estimates of how many young women and girls have already fallen victim? 3. Does the Commission intend to conduct an EU‑wide campaign to draw young women's attention to this problem? 4. Are there estimates of how many young women have been brought from Eastern Europe to the West and forced into prostitution? 5. To what extent does the EU suspect that organised crime has involvement in this form of forced prostitution? 6. Are there plans to review protection for victims in this connection?
