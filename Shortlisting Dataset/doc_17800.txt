Question for written answer E-008271/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (16 September 2011) Subject: VP/HR — Racist persecution of ‘blacks’ in Libya Over the past few days a number of press and TV news sources have documented the terrible ‘black hunting’ that is being carried out in Libya, where black-skinned people are being arrested in huge numbers and kept locked up in detention centres in reprehensible conditions. This persecution is being carried out on the assumption that these people may be ‘mercenaries’ at the service of Gaddafi, but the racist nature of their persecution is demonstrated by the fact that Libyans who are Gaddafi loyalists are not being treated in such a manner. Will the High Representative of the EU take action to put an immediate end to these racist practices against African prisoners in Libya?
