21 October 1999 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION further to the Council and Commission statements pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure by the following Members: Watson, Ludford, Wiebenga and De Clercq on behalf of the ELDR Group on the extraordinary European Council meeting on the area of freedom, security and justice (Tampere, 15/16 October 1999) The European Parliament, Having regard to the conclusions of the European Council special meeting on 15 and 16 October 1999 in Tampere on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union and to the declarations by the Presidents of Parliament and the Commission on the same subject Constitutional and democratic features 1. Notes the significance of the Heads of State and Government holding their first special summit devoted to the important issues which are at the core of a Union “founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law”; 2. Regrets that, despite the stress placed by the European Council on democratic institutions being a foundation stone of European integration, the Presidency Conclusions contain no reference to the content of the President of Parliament’s intervention nor to the specific recommendations addressed by Parliament to the European Council; stresses in particular the necessity for an increase in democratic control; 3. Resolves to organise before the end of the year, through its Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, another interparliamentary conference on the area of freedom, security and justice (on the lines of that organised in March 1999) with participation from representatives of civil society as well as national parliaments; Towards an area of freedom, security and justice 4. Applauds the European Council’s decision to maintain the objective of developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice at the very top of the political agenda by means of establishing a “scoreboard” but reminds the European Council that its determination must encompass a comprehensive approach which pays full attention to issues affecting citizens’ rights, including their rights against governments; believes that against this criteria there was some unevenness and some gaps in the summit results such as, for example, the failure to open a channel for citizens to have recourse to the European Court of Justice to enforce their rights; Fundamental rights and non-discrimination 5. Welcomes the European Council’s acceptance of Parliament’s demands regarding the composition, working methods and practical arrangements for the body charged with drawing up a draft European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights (and indeed congratulates the Council for agreeing that the body should elect its own Chair) and hopes that the result will be a substantive and meaningful Charter; 6. Regrets that the European Council did not use this opportunity to take concrete steps to reinforce citizens’ rights to move and reside freely throughout the Union and - despite reaffirming the principle of transparency - citizens’ rights to freedom of information and access to documents, including an end to secrecy in the Council when acting in its legislative capacity; 7. Welcomes
