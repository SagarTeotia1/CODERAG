Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (27 July 2007) The Commission would inform the Honourable Member that, in the absence of harmonisation in the field of car registration taxes, Member States are free to lay down their own national provisions. However, these have to be in line with the general principles of the EC Treaty and, in particular, must not give rise to border-crossing formalities in trade between Member States and must respect the non discrimination principle. Problems resulting from the application of diverse registration taxes are not considered to be against EC rules by jurisprudence, but are the result of the lack of harmonisation at Community level. The Commission presented a proposal on passenger car related taxes COM(2005)261 final. in 2005, based on Article 93 of the EC Treaty, which among other things includes provisions providing for the gradual abolition or registration taxes over a period of five to 10 years. This proposal, although receiving a two thirds majority at Parliament, requires a unanimous decision at the Council for adoption.
