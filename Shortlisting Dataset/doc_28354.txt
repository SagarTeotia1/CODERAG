WRITTEN QUESTION E-6363/09 by Carmen Fraga Estévez (PPE) and Francisco José Millán Mon (PPE) to the Commission (22 December 2009) Subject: Shift from biological testing methods for detecting biotoxins On 17 November, the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health agreed to replace the current biological method of testing used for detecting marine biotoxins in live bivalve molluscs with a chemical method known as electrophoresis. Various scientific reports, which share the conviction that the protocols and testing and control procedures currently used are more than adequate to guarantee the quality and healthiness of these products, provide fundamental technical and scientific support for the rejection of the Committee's proposed amendment. Nor has the new procedure been negotiated within the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which means that the WTO could reject the change in methodology, since it is more burdensome and complicated for the producer countries. Furthermore the new method would become a reference method without its appropriateness for control programmes having been tested, validated and proven. Given that we are speaking about a means of detecting toxic compounds, there could be extremely grave consequences for consumer health and for consumer confidence in the products in question as a result of an over hasty and incorrect replacement of the current reference method — the efficacy whereof with regard to protecting public health has been fully proven — with a new method which has not been verified in identical terms. On what is the Commission basing its elimination of biological testing (tests on mice) as the reference method for testing to detect marine biotoxins? Is the chemical method involving high-performance liquid chromatography — mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) internationally validated? What guarantees does the Commission have that the legal text in question will not be published before the international validation of this method?
