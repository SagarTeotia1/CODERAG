WRITTEN QUESTION E-3483/06 by Mario Borghezio (NI) to the Council (26 July 2006) Subject: European Investment Bank funding for the media Two years ago in England there came to light a scandal involving ‘loans’ from the European Investment Bank to the BBC. The BBC has hitherto always denied the existence of such subsidies but it has now admitted that it has received funding from the EIB and that it is continuing to do so. There is a clear conflict of interest here between the BBC — which continues to profess its neutrality as regards its reporting from Brussels — and the European Investment Bank, which was set up in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome with the stated task of financing activities which further European integration. Will the Council say: 1. Which other media are funded by the EIB for the purpose of promoting European integration? 2. Does such a policy perhaps not contravene the principles of freedom and pluralism, pursuant to which the media are required to provide independent political information without placing those who are critical of European integration at a disadvantage?
