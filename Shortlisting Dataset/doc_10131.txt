The rejection of the urgency means that the initiative will not now be considered by Parliament. At its last part-session, Parliament deemed it unacceptable that the rights of those expelled are only listed in an annex to the proposal and not in the proposal itself. Furthermore, MEPs believe it is important to display consistency by drawing up a common asylum policy before introducing a common return policy.
