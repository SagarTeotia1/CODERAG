ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0017/05 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Kathalijne Buitenweg , on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group to the Commission Subject: Data retention and data protection What is the Commission's position concerning the draft framework decision on data retention by telecom service providers as proposed by France, the UK, Ireland and Sweden? Does the Commission support the substance of that proposal? If not, what are the specific points of the proposal on which the Commission disagrees? Does the Commission support the choice of a third-pillar legal basis? Should the draft framework decision be rejected by Parliament, will the Commission ask the four Member States to withdraw the initiative, and will it put forward a new proposal? When will the Commission propose, in response to repeated requests from the EP, an instrument that would assure in the third pillar the same level of protection as provided in the first pillar by Directive 95/46/EC ? OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31.
