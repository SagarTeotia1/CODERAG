Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (10 December 2004) The issue of enhancing the brake lights on vehicles is being seriously considered and the Commission is actively involved in discussing this subject within the World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, WP29, of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and specifically in its expert working group on lighting (GRE). Within GRE the discussions on the enhancement of the brake lights are well advanced and have focussed on the provision of an ‘emergency braking’ signal. With regard to this, two basic issues have been considered. First, what the appearance of the signal should be, and second, when it should operate. The Commission has been pressing GRE to reach consensus and conclude discussions on this subject. With regard to ‘Rearguard’, no specific proposal has been presented in GRE, neither by the Commission nor by industry nor by any of the Member States. This is due to the fact that there are a large number of alternative solutions that are being discussed at the moment. The devices in question need to work in a fully predictable and guaranteed way. It would have to be ensured that they do not create false alarms as these would be contrary to safety. As such any solution would have to be examined in great technical detail and tested under all possible conditions.
