access to basic rights as well as to civic and political participation; 16. Calls on the Commission to conduct a study examining which Member States have enacted positive action provisions and how they have applied them; 17. Urges the Commission to issue as soon as possible a proposal for a horizontal directive implementing the principle of equal treatment outside the scope of employment, including access to goods, services and housing, education, social protection and social advantages, immigration and asylum, and covering all grounds of discrimination set out in Article 13 of the EC Treaty; deeply regrets that the Commission has indicated that it does not intend to put forward proposals to complete the anti-discrimination package, as requested repeatedly by Parliament and as announced in the Annual Policy Strategy for 2008, but instead appears to intend to limit further proposals to those prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of disability; 18. Notes with concern that while 19 Member States have signed Protocol No12 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, only 5 have ratified that Protocol.
