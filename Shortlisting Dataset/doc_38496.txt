their environment to ensure long-term food security, assisted by adequate public support, such as access to loans, non-profit micro-credit and seeds; 10. Calls on the EU and developing countries to promote land ownership as a tool for reducing poverty and guaranteeing food security, by strengthening property rights and facilitating access to non-profit micro-credit for farmers, small businesses and local communities; stresses the importance of new investments in enhancing the capacities of small farmers, more efficient water management technologies and restoration of soil nutrients; 11. Points out that it is necessary to introduce better agricultural production methods in developing countries, including low-cost technologies, provide research in agriculture, and increase productivity, in order to enhance sustainability and mitigate the negative effects of food insecurity; 12. Points out that humanitarian food assistance should match the needs, challenges and structural constraints in developing countries; in this respect underlines that it is important that food assistance should take into account the local production, distribution, transport and marketing capacities of these countries, contributing to building the bases for their long-term food security; Producers' income and access to inputs 13. Notes that among the factors that most influence the price transmission mechanism and the gap between consumer and producer prices are: increasing concentration along the food supply chain, the degree of product processing, price rises linked to other external cost factors and speculation in agricultural commodities; 14. Notes that farm input costs are rising faster than agricultural commodity prices; is concerned that this could result in reduced farm output, which would exacerbate the food crisis in the EU and in the world; stresses that concentration in the input sector has devastating effects on the sustainability of farming, fostering dependency on a limited number of corporations for the purchasing of seeds and specialised fertilizers; calls on the Commission to ensure, in the context of increased consolidation, that a freely operating market functions in the input sector, contributing to food supply; 15. Expresses concern about low farm incomes in the EU; affirms that decreased incomes due to rising production costs and price volatility impact negatively on farmers' ability to maintain production and that as a result farmers do not benefit from increased food prices; firmly believes that food security will be compromised if these issues are not sufficiently addressed; Food and energy production 16. Recalls that energy security and food security are very closely linked; recognises that energy costs are a key factor in determining the level of profitability of agriculture, which is in the main oil-dependent; encourages measures that incentivise farmers to become more energy-efficient and develop alternative energy supply sources; calls on the EU and national governments to launch campaigns and put into place structural changes to minimise food waste; 17. Considers, however, that the increased drive to develop renewable energy sources and meet the 2020 targets must take into account the impact on food production and supply; stresses the delicate balance involved in meeting the food/fuel challenge; Research 18. Emphasises the importance of publicly funded research which serves to promote food security; calls for investment in research not
