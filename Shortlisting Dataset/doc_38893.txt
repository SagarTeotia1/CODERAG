Question for written answer E-004323/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Rovana Plumb (S&D) (4 May 2011) Subject: EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) — Value Added Tax EU energy and environment/climate policy goals are said not to be achievable without a major shift in the way European infrastructure is developed. This means financial sources for investments. Some of this could be the revenue from auctioning allowances under the ETS. Having in mind that starting from 2013 a quantity of allowances will be auctioned, does the Commission consider that it is necessary to harmonise the status of certificates in order to avoid VAT fraud?
