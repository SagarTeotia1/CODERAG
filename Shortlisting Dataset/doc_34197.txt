Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (11 January 2011) 1. EU interventions on urban development could be financed either by Axis IV of the Norte Regional Operational Programme 2007‑13 or by Axis IX of the POVT Programme. Public authorities or potential beneficiaries should submit applications for funding within the financing framework and conditions established for each programme. The Commission would therefore suggest that the interested parties should consult the programmes' websites or contact directly the managing authorities of the programmes concerned for further information, namely: Gabinete de Gestão do Programa Operacional ‘Regional do Norte’ 2007‑13 Rua Rainha D.
