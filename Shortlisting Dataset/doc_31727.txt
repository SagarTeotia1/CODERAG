Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (25 May 2005) The Guidelines, to which the Honourable Member refers, were approved by the Commission on 6 April 2005. They were published on the Commission’s Website in three languages and a full publication in all EU languages was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 27 April 2005 OJ C 101, 27.4.2005. . With regard to the question concerning real imports, it became clear on the basis of import figures, covering the first three months of 2005, that imports from China of certain product categories had reached such proportions as to justify the opening of investigations in order to determine whether it would be warranted to request formal consultations with China. The opening of these investigations was announced in the Official Journal on 29 April 2005 OJ C 104, 29.4.2005. . In light of the outcome of the investigations, it may be decided, after a positive opinion of the EU Textile Committee, to open formal consultations with China on the basis of the existing special China textile clause. In such an eventuality, a ceiling may be placed on Chinese exports on the basis of past performance for the products in question, as defined in the abovementioned Guidelines and Article 10a of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries, as amended OJ L 275, 8.11.1993, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 138/2003, of 21 January 2003, OJ L 23, 28.1.2003. .
