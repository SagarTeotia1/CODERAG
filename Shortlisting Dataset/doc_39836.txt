Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (24 November 2006) The Commission’s decisions on the principles of the procedure to be adopted for replies to national parliaments were taken on 5 September and 4 October 2006. It decided to empower the Vice-President responsible for institutional relations to reply to the national parliaments on its behalf, provided that she had the prior agreement of the Commissioners responsible for the dossiers. In the case of sensitive issues, the Commission as a whole would be called upon to reach a decision. It is not the Commission’s intention to ignore the concerns and wishes of the national parliaments. On the contrary, it is precisely in order to involve all interested parties in EU developments that it wishes to transmit its legislative proposals and consultation papers to the national parliaments and to invite them to react with a view to improving the process of policy formulation.
