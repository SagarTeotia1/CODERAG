Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (25 February 2011) 1. As mandated by Council Recommendation (1999/519/EC) of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (EMF) (0 Hz‑300 GHz), the Commission monitors developments in scientific evidence through requests to the independent Scientific Committee for Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks. In January 2009, the Committee, having reviewed all available scientific evidence, adopted an opinion on Health Effects of Exposure to EMF http://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_022.pdf . A large part of the evidence mentioned was included in this opinion. The next review, expected for late 2011, will take all new scientific evidence into account. So far, the independent reviews have not identified any scientific rationale to change the proposed exposure limits. As a result, the Commission is not considering modifying the limits at this stage. 2. In its resolution on ‘Health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields’ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&language=EN&reference=P6-TA-2009-0216 of 2 April 2009, the European Parliament did not renew its 2007 call upon the Council to lower the proposed exposure limits. Instead it decided to ‘urge the Commission to review the scientific basis and adequacy of the EMF limits as laid down in Recommendation 1999/519/EC and report to the Parliament’ and to ‘call for the review to be undertaken by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks’. The Commission considers that Council Recommendation (1999/519/EC) is in line with the application of the precautionary principle. The Commission is ready to revise or update the recommendation if justified on the basis of the most recent independent scientific assessments. 3. In 2009, the Commission has requested an opinion of the SCENIHR on the ‘Research needs and methodology to address the remaining knowledge gaps on the potential health effects of EMF’ http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_024.pdf . This opinion is contributing to the selection of research topics to be funded under the EU Framework Programme for Research. The Commission has already funded research projects on the potential health effects of EMF under the 5th ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/life/docs/emf_brochure_sheets.pdf and the 6th http://web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/emf-net/index.cfm framework programmes for research. The current seventh EU Framework Programme for Research (FP 7200 7‑13) http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html is funding two projects investigating the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields: MOBI-KIDS http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP7_PROJ_EN&ACTION=D&RCN=89894 (the largest study in the world focused on risk of development of brain cancer related to mobile phone use in children and adolescents); and SEAWIND http://www.eurosfaire.prd.fr/7pc/doc/1250171636_project_catalogue_2009.pdf (study focused on exposure and health risks of wireless technologies). In response to the most recent call for proposals under FP7, a new research project is expected to clarify whether there could be a link between exposure to extremely low frequency fields and childhood leukaemia.
