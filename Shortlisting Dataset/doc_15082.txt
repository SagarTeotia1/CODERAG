Question for written answer E-9657/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) (23 November 2010) Subject: Support for the development of native breeds of cattle On a recent visit to the Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro region I held meetings with various associations and cooperatives set up by breeders of native cattle breeds, such as Mirandesa, Maronesa and Barrosã. The experience of local producers shows some positive aspects but also a number of difficulties that continue to hamper efforts to do more to develop native breeds. Many producers who would like to opt for the development of native breeds find that the available incentives are not sufficient to offset the losses of income that this option frequently entails. In a context where current agricultural and trade policies have contributed to increasingly uniform agricultural production, promoted intensive production models and helped bring about the consequent decline in biodiversity, leading to the erosion of the genetic base on which human nutrition depends, the development of native breeds is of undoubted importance. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. What specific support might be earmarked for the development of native breeds of cattle, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized producers? 2. For what Community support might producers' associations and cooperatives be eligible, inter alia in the following areas: credit insurance (particularly important in the current crisis, to protect organisations working with very small marketing margins); artificial insemination (as a way of combating brucellosis)? 3. In the context of the reform of the common agricultural policy, in what way will the Commission strengthen the above forms of support?
