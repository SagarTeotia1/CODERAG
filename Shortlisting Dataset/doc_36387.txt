distributional impacts, particularly on low income households. However, all Member States have the means that will allow them to address such distributional impacts. In particular possible additional revenue that CO 2 taxation might generate could be used to provide targeted assistance to the most vulnerable sections of the population and in particular, to those for whom energy represents a proportionally higher component of their spending. The Commission is aware that the French authorities are indeed considering possible options and the Commission welcomes the fact that the French authorities wish to design an assistance scheme that would tackle undesirable distributional impacts in a targeted way, but that would not undermine the incentive effect of the CO 2 tax (e.g. lump sum allowance unrelated to actual energy consumption but possibly differentiated according to the income and location of the consumer).
