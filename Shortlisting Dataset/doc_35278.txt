WRITTEN QUESTION E-1607/05 by Glyn Ford (PSE) to the Commission (2 May 2005) Subject: Fair trade designation Is the Commission aware of the rapid increase in the number of European Union consumers who are prepared to pay a premium in order to purchase goods that are ‘fair trade’ goods? Is the Commission considering — and if not will it consider — introducing a directive that lays down a set of criteria that must be met in order for the ‘fair trade’ designation to be used to avoid unscrupulous traders exploiting the label to merely increase profits without seriously engaging in ‘fair trade’ practices?
