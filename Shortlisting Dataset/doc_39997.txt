Question for written answer E-5069/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (2 July 2010) Subject: Internet censorship in Vietnam Students and young people in Vietnam have recently been complaining that local authorities are, either totally or partially, preventing people from connecting to websites such as Facebook, BBCVietnamese.com and articles written by Vietnamese journalists abroad. At present there are at least 24 million Internet users in Vietnam. 90 % of students from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City use it for their research and over 60 % of young and middle-aged people use the Internet at home or in Internet cafés. However, last month the local authorities forced the managers of these premises to install special software that is able to identify and retain for 30 days users' surfing tracks. As a result, the government is blocking a number of websites and following Internet users' tracks. 1. Is the Commission aware of the lack of freedom of information, communication and speech in Vietnam? 2. What measures does it intend to take to safeguard the existence of sites which talk about democracy, freedom, justice and peace in Vietnam?
