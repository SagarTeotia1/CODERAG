Question for written answer E-3854/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Marielle De Sarnez (ALDE) (1 June 2010) Subject: Theft of building equipment Theft of building equipment is a major concern for construction companies, equipment manufacturers, distributors and repairers, and plant hire companies. The sector estimates the cost at more than EUR 1 billion per year with a clear upward trend in recent years. The construction industry has, with the support of some Member State governments and private operators, taken action to try to curb this phenomenon itself, notably by fitting equipment with anti-theft devices, training staff, improving security on construction sites and by setting up procedures to facilitate the recovery of stolen equipment. Nonetheless, combating equipment theft in Europe is not something the building industry can handle on its own. Most of the action taken today, notably at cross-border level, relies more on the goodwill of the police forces concerned than on concerted measures and strategic planning. — Does the Commission intend to facilitate discussions at EU‑level between all the parties interested in combating equipment theft, including public authorities, with the aim of adopting a strategy and developing effective measures? — Could the Commission set up a European register of stolen equipment, which police forces and private operators such as insurance companies, auctioneers and resellers of second-hand equipment could consult?
