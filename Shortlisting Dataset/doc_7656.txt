to draw up local strategy plans for areas which are, or have the potential to become, centres of innovative manufacturing clusters; to this end calls for local strategy plans to be targeted at making the best possible use of the primary wealth producing sector, research potential and any comparative benefits offered by each region; calls on Member States to make full use of the possibilities in the Structural Funds in this respect; 27. Points out that future European industrial policy measures must allow not just for the sectoral dimension, but also for the territorial dimension; notes that areas with a high concentration of manufacturing industry have to have industrial and economic policies geared to their specific needs; calls on the Commission, therefore, to follow up the proposals announced in the Communication by bringing further consideration to bear on the questions whether cooperation should be intensified among regions facing similar problems and challenges and how manufacturing companies in those regions might be encouraged to set up networks within which to pursue and coordinate the necessary industrial and economic policies; 28. Believes that the Structural Funds could do a great deal to strengthen industry; criticises, therefore, the cut in the amount to be allocated to them under the financial perspective, which will impact firstly on the EU’s capacity to promote innovation and improve workers’ training levels, and secondly on working conditions; hopes that the Council will agree to a substantial increase in the Structural Funds; 29. Welcomes the Commission proposal to integrate and coordinate industrial policy with other policies, including cohesion, environmental, R & D, and energy policies; notes that cohesion policy and industrial policy are interrelated, given that infrastructure and human resources are needed to enable industrial policy to succeed and to enhance the significant role of the European Works Councils, and hence that it is essential to bring policies into a coherent relationship and secure a high degree of involvement within society; 30. Believes that sectors facing fierce international competition should jointly adopt measures to facilitate their restructuring and modernization; in this respect, cites a number of initiatives, such as LeaderSHIP 2015, CARS21 and the High-Level Group on textiles and clothing, as good examples; in view of the urgent need for action in the last two sectors, calls on the Commission to submit concrete proposals by Autumn 2006 with a view to their adoption by the Council and Parliament giving its opinion before the end of 2006; welcomes the intention of the Commission to set up such sector-specific initiatives for the pharmaceutical, chemical, defence, space and mechanical engineering industries; 31. Is of the opinion that, as far as individual sectors are concerned, workers’ trade unions, consumer associations, and employers’ organisations must be involved in the debate so as to help ensure that industrial policy solutions will be better suited to their purpose and more comprehensive; 32. Stresses the importance of establishing a dialogue with all the parties concerned, and welcomes the creation of the High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment; 33. Is of the opinion that the European Globalisation
