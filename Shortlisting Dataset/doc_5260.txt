WRITTEN QUESTION E-6619/08 by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE) to the Commission (16 December 2008) Subject: Flying tax In its answer to my Written Question P‑0297/08, the Commission said at the time that it was too early to judge whether the tax complied with Community law. Since then the Dutch flying tax has entered into force, with effect from 1 July 2008. 1. Is it possible to conclude from this that the Commission considers the Dutch flying tax to be compatible with Community law and the Chicago Convention? If not, why not? 2. And if so, can the Commission state very precisely and in extensive detail why it considers that the Dutch flying tax is compatible with Community law and the Chicago Convention?
