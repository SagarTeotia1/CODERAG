ORAL QUESTION H-0343/02 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Göran Färm to the Commission Subject: Implementation of the budget For a number of years now, the EU's budget out-turn has been a large surplus. This is a negative trend since it implies that committed funding is not reaching its intended destination. In the long run this will jeopardise the EU's credibility. What steps will the Commission take to resolve this serious problem? Is the Commission in consultation with the Council and the Member States with a view to improving the implementation of the Union's budget?
