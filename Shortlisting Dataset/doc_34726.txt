Answer given by Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (28 September 2010) The effective response to the affected population will depend on ensuring a proper transition from emergency response to reconstruction. The overall EU pledge at the International Donors' Conference in New York was EUR 1.235 billion. The European Commission's share of this pledge was EUR 460 million. In the medium to longer term, the coordination of reconstruction activities in Haiti has been assigned to the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC). The IHRC is composed of representatives of the Haiti government and all the major donors, including the Commission. An amount of EUR 120 million was provided in humanitarian aid to Haiti in the wake of the earthquake by the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO). This aid is currently being delivered to those in need and has been instrumental in preventing loss of life and outbreak of epidemics during the first critical months of the crisis. The humanitarian response will remain crucial for the months to come. The Commission will continue to focus its response on food security, shelter, water and sanitation, protection, health, and disaster risk reduction. However, allocating substantial additional funding for humanitarian aid is not likely to result in a rapid improvement of the situation as the absorption capacity of implementing agencies is limited and operational constraints in key sectors such as shelter continue to persist.
