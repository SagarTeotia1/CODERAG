WRITTEN QUESTION E-3356/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Council (29 June 2007) Subject: Russia-Burma agreement to build nuclear research reactor In May 2007, Russia's atomic energy agency and the Burmese regime signed an agreement to build a nuclear research reactor in Burma and to train about 350 Burmese specialists in nuclear technology. The agency said that the 10-megawatt nuclear reactor, fuelled by less than 20 % uranium-235, will contribute to Burma's research in nuclear physics, biotechnology and material science as well as medicine production. Russia has become a major political supporter and supplier of arms to Burma's military regime since the US and EU imposed sanctions in response to the country's poor human rights record. Is the Council concerned about the Russia-Burma nuclear agreement? Has the Council raised its concerns with both Russia and Burma and, if so, what was the outcome of those discussions? Has the Council brought any pressure to bear on Russia regarding its continuing political support for the ruling military junta in Burma and, in particular, its continued supply of arms? Does the Council consider that Russia's continued support for Burma is undermining the effectiveness of the EU and US sanctions on Burma?
