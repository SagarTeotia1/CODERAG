of the situation to date regarding implementation in the Member States and by checking that flexibility measures have been properly accompanied by security measures for workers, and to assist Member States and the social partners in implementing the principles of flexicurity so that they are applied with respect for acquired social rights at European level and in accordance with the specific nature of the various labour markets and the differing traditions with regard to labour policies and collective bargaining and the structure of social security systems, and points out that reciprocal learning, exchanges of good practice and the open coordination method are essential tools for coordinating the varying strategic approaches of the Member States; 29. Believes that, especially in the context of the present economic situation, taking stock of the implementation of flexicurity in the Member States is even more necessary and that the social partners will only support labour-law and labour-market reforms if they also aim at effectively reducing differences in treatment between different types of contracts; points out that the application of flexibility principles requires adequate social protection, ensuring that people can live and develop, together with special support for job seekers and solid labour laws for all kinds of employment based on a clear institutional framework, and needs to be accompanied by increased protection mechanisms to prevent hardship; 30.

Emphasises the importance of preventing, detecting and penalising illicit employment; calls on the Commission to draw up a set of concrete initiatives, including specific rules to tackle ’letter box companies’, provisions on joint and several liability in subcontracting chains and the creation of an EU agency to prevent and detect illicit employment; 34.
