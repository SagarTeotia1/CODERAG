WRITTEN QUESTION E-4758/05 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (15 December 2005) Subject: Pre-accession aid for Turkey until 2005 Since 1987, Turkey has been making efforts to achieve accession to the EU and is aiming to reach EU level. In reality, it is still far from the EU average. In light of its catastrophic economic situation, Turkey was close to State bankruptcy in 2001 and was saved mainly through IMF financial assistance. EU money certainly contributed to this. Between 2004 and 2006, EUR 1050 million of pre-accession aid is supposedly planned for Turkey. 1. How much money has been given to date (from the establishment of the European Community to the year 2005) in pre-accession aid, and how much in other aid assistance has been paid to Turkey? 2. What are the various EU programmes (agriculture, structure, etc.) from which Turkey could have acquired money to date, and how much did it receive from each programme? 3. How many cases are there of fraud in relation to the aid paid? How much has been linked to fraud, and how much of this was claimed back?
