Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (11 July 2006) The Commission is aware of the occasional use of dynamite by certain fishermen and understands and supports the efforts of the Galician federation of Fishermen’s Associations to abolish this practice. The Commission has already taken action, since this practice is forbidden by virtue of Article 31 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998, for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms OJ L 125, 27.4.1998 . . The Commission is preoccupied by the fact that this illegal activity is still used by certain fishermen and would appreciate to receive more detailed information about it. Since the control of fishing activities falls, however, under national competence it is up to Member States to ensure that such illegal practice does not continue. On its part the Commission will seek to establish Member States compliance with this duty.
