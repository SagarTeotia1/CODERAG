WRITTEN QUESTION E-2552/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (8 April 2009) Subject: Protected timber for public works The environmental activist organisation Greenpeace has spoken out against illegal imports of protected timber from Liberia. The wood apparently originated from illegal logging at the time of the civil war; timber imports were banned under the UN embargo on commodities from Liberia. The 660000 tonnes of timber concerned have been acquired by Interwood S.r.l., the company which has been awarded a contract with MeT.Ro Roma Spa for the management and extension of the Rome underground railway, controlled in part by Rome City Council. The problem lies in the fact that in the procedure from which Interwood emerged as the winning bidder, environmental certification was not mentioned, contrary to what is provided for in the Greenpeace plan for verification of the origin of raw materials used in public works, which Rome City Council endorsed in 2002. The timber in question could now be used in the maintenance and extension of Rome’s two underground lines. 1. Is the Commission aware of this matter? 2. Would it not be desirable to stipulate that commodities and products entering EU territory must conform to requirements related to environmental protection and the conservation of protected areas, in addition to quality and safety requirements? 3. Does the Commission not consider it unfair that environmental certification requirements concerning the origin of raw materials used in public works should apply only to those local authorities which have chosen to comply with the Greenpeace plan?
