Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2011) The Commission expects higher education institutions to pay out the biggest part of the EU grants as much as possible before the start of the Erasmus mobility period. It is nevertheless common practice to release a final payment after the submission of the final report upon return of the Erasmus students. The implementation of mobility actions of the Erasmus programme is decentralised to the national agencies and it is their responsibility to set the detailed rules within general EU guidelines. If Erasmus students face a particular problem, they can contact the sending higher education institution (HEI) or, if problems persist, the Erasmus national agency of the sending institution. The sending HEI receives funding from the national agency, which deducts any interest yielded by pre-financing exceeding EUR 50 000. Based on the information received from the Italian national agency concerning the payment modalities for mobility funds at the University of Siena, the grant agreement between this university and the Erasmus students enters into force when the students send the certificate of the host institution confirming the beginning of the mobility period. The agreement foresees a pre-financing by the university within 45 days of the date of entry into force of the agreement, representing 80 % of the total EU grant. The balance of the EU grant is paid at the end of the mobility period when the students return the official documents required (the narrative report and the host institution certificate).
