— ‘Infrastructure related to the development and adaptation of agriculture and forestry.’ The organic production of medicinal plants is supported under Action 2 — ‘Organic Farming’ of Measure 214 — ‘Agri-environmental Payments’, thus contributing to the attainment of the environmental objectives of this measure. Moreover, Measures 311 — ‘Diversification into non-agricultural activities’ and 312 — ‘Support for business creation and development’ could also finance activities or micro-enterprises related, for instance, to the processing of medicinal plants into non-agricultural products, promoting therefore rural employment and entrepreneurship. Farmers and other possible beneficiaries can take advantage of these opportunities by responding to the calls for projects and for applications launched by the Managing Authority of the Lazio Region throughout the 2007‑13 programming period.
