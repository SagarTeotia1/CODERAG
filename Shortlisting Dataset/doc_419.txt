WRITTEN QUESTION E-0861/07 by Emilio Menéndez del Valle (PSE) to the Council (22 February 2007) Subject: Exploitation by Iran of the isolation of Hamas A report of 1 February 2007 by the British House of Commons' Committee on International Development expresses the view that the policy towards Hamas of Israel and the international donors is benefiting Iran. This text states: ‘The withholding of revenues by Israel and the boycott of the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority by existing donors has led the Hamas government increasingly to look elsewhere for financial support. As a result, Hamas now has closer links to governments like that of Iran than it had two years ago. We doubt whether this is a development that the international community would have intended’. In addition, there has been no significant loss of popularity by Hamas among the Palestinians. Does the Council not believe that a policy which has such results now needs to be modified?
