national level; 14. Stresses that synergy goes beyond complementary project funding; considers that capacity building, networking and knowledge transfer is an important form of synergy and notes that all instruments offer opportunities for such exchanges; 15. Notes that actual synergies from the point of view of the direct beneficiary of funding depend on the beneficiary's organisational and strategic capacity to combine support from different EU instruments; calls on the regional actors to create regional strategies that can facilitate the combination of funding; 16. Recommends that Member States and the Commission allocate sufficient resources from the SF for research and innovation, in particular sustainable innovations, and strengthen research capacities; stresses the need to promote and apply successful models in the knowledge triangle and to ensure the sustainable development of regional research and strategic frameworks for innovation in collaboration with enterprises, research centres, universities and public authorities; highlights the potential of knowledge-intensive regional innovative clusters in mobilising regional competitiveness and welcomes the inclusion of cluster development in both CIP and FP7 (Regions of Knowledge action in FP7); highlights the new Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) established within the framework of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), linking up leading European knowledge-intensive regional clusters; notes that knowledge exchange in regional clusters can also be facilitated by Structural Funds; emphasises that such clusters represent a major opportunity for disadvantaged regions in particular; 17. Calls on regional and local authorities to make better use of the SF to build up research, knowledge and innovation capacity in their regions, for instance by setting up research infrastructure, enabling them to take part in EU research and innovation activities; encourages regions to establish SF R&D priorities that are complementary with those of FP7 and calls for long-term planning at regional level in order to achieve synergies that derive from thematic complementarities between the financial instruments; 18. Highlights the importance of analysing, sharing and integrating best practices concerning synergies between the policy instruments; in this context, welcomes the efforts made by the Commission to improve inter-departmental cooperation and calls on it to step up regional-level analysis of research and innovation potential and needs, in particular as regards the collection of available qualitative data, as well as analysis of the interrelations with other instruments in the evaluation studies on either of the three financing instruments, in order to be able to provide joint guidance; 19. Notes with satisfaction the Practical Guide to EU Funding Opportunities for Research and Innovation; recommends that in future such guidance notes be provided immediately after the legislative frameworks come into effect; awaits the Commission Staff Working Document containing examples of synergies in practice; calls on the Commission to act as a facilitator, promoting the exchange of good practices, and to evaluate the possibility of providing additional expert support on Community funding opportunities through ex-ante guidance notes and a ‘user's manual’ for the practical management and administration of research and innovation projects with a view to achieving the intended results; 20. Calls on the Commission to simplify the bureaucracy for the FP7 and CIP in order
