ORAL QUESTION H-0621/03 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Josu Ortuondo Larrea to the Commission Subject: Notification of allocation of fishing opportunities Articles 20(3) and 20(5) of Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy requires the Kingdom of Spain to provide appropriate notification concerning its method of allocating the fishing opportunities assigned to it in accordance with Community law. In reply to my previous question P-2656/03 , the Commission stated that Spain had not yet informed it of the method it had chosen for allocating the fishing opportunities assigned to it. What action will the Commission take in the face of the Spanish Government's failure to comply with the requirements laid down in Articles 20(3) and 20(5) of Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources? OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59
