Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (12 January 2011) Technical data on the conditions for use of railway infrastructure are set out in two separate documents: the ‘network statement’ and the ‘register of infrastructure’. The ‘network statement’ referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2001/14/EC OJ L 75, 15.3.2001 . must include, inter alia , a section setting out the nature of the infrastructure which is available to railway undertakings and the conditions of access to it. However, the ‘network statement’ is basically meant to provide the information necessary to enable application for infrastructure and does not necessarily contain all detailed technical data needed to calculate admissible speed on specific sections of the infrastructure and train composition. To this end, more detailed information concerning the infrastructure technical characteristics must be included in the ‘register of infrastructure’ referred to in Article 35 of Directive 2008/57/EC OJ L 91, 18.7.2008 . . The specifications regarding presentation, format, revision cycle and instruction for use of this register are now being drafted by the European Railway Agency. A Commission decision on these specifications is foreseen to be adopted in the course of 2011 based on a recommendation by the Agency.
