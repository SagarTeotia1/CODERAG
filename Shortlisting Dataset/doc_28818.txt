definitions contained in the directive; these concern industrial practices (amendments 2 and 3), existing international or Community law (amendments 6, 8, 11) and the correction of technical errors in the Commission proposal (amendments 9 and 10). In line with the argument set out in this explanatory statement, the rapporteur has tabled five amendments to the limits set for a number of specific subcategories (amendments 12 - 16), in order to maintain quality (or the protective function) of the subcategories of paints and to avoid the risk of increasing VOC emissions. The other amendments concern: - the commitology procedure, laid down in Article 12, where clarification is required to take account of existing labelling practices in the industry; this change relates to the scope of Article 4 (amendment 5); - monitoring by Member States, set out in Article 3 (amendment 4). - the approach to product substitution, set out in recital 6 (amendment 1). - the feasibility study proposed by the Commission in Article 9 (amendment 7): this amendment is justified by the changes made to Annex II by amendment 13.
