Question for written answer E-012331/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (5 January 2012) Subject: Launch of a consumer markets scoreboard on fuels The Commission has just announced that it is to launch a ‘consumer markets scoreboard’ on the consumer credit and fuel markets. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. What is the budget allocated to this market research? 2. How does it justify the absolute priority given to such research, when these markets are already the subject of numerous surveys and studies conducted by a number of organisations, universities, industries and market research firms? 3. How does it justify the need for and urgency of such expenditure when consumer organisations lack the resources to deal with the daily problems of consumers, which have never been more critical?
