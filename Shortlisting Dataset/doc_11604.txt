WRITTEN QUESTION E-0571/09 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Council (4 February 2009) Subject: Cyprus and Partnership for Peace (PfP) Cyprus is the only Member State in the European Union which is neither a NATO member nor a PfP member. Thus, it is excluded from ESDP operations, which use NATO assets. This state of affairs causes problems for the entire ESDP mechanism. Does the Council think that it should advise the Cyprus Government to apply for PfP membership in order to rectify this situation?
