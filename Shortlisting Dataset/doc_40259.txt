WRITTEN QUESTION P-3377/08 by Donata Gottardi (PSE) to the Commission (13 June 2008) Subject: Discrimination against the Roma Draft law No 115 of the Veneto Region (eighth legislative term), which seeks to repeal Regional Law No 54 of 22 December 1989 on measures to protect the culture of the Roma and the Sinti, is about to be adopted. The bill was approved by the competent council committee and is shortly to be adopted by the Regional Council. Does the Commission not think that repealing this law is at odds with the policies of the European Union, which recognise the Roma as the ethnic group most subject to discrimination in Europe and require Member States and local authorities to take measures to combat discrimination and foster social inclusion? Does it not think that the statements included in the background report to the effect that the funding granted had caused enormous harm to the people of the Veneto, that the Roma and Sinti are nomadic tribes whose presence in the region should not be safeguarded, but at best tolerated, and that these people have absolutely no desire to integrate into Italian society, are particularly serious in that they are being made by a regional authority? Rather than repealing a law which serves to fund the camps, would it not be better to amend it in such a way as to promote the measures referred to in its title and provide support for settlement sites, vocational training and the right to education for minors, in line with best practice as applied in the European Union?
