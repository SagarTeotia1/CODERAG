Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2011) 1. Free movement of capital is one of the four freedoms and at the heart of the European Union. Flourishing and robust financial markets are key to finance the real economy. However, excessive speculation can be detrimental in certain circumstances, in particular when the speculation focuses on sovereign borrowers and should be therefore eliminated. Lack of transparency on such activity is harmful. To this end, the Commission aims at reducing systemic risk and improving transparency on all derivatives transactions. Mandatory central clearing for all ‘over the counter’ (OTC) derivatives and mandatory reporting to trade repositories have been proposed COM(2010) 484, 15.9.2010. . In this context, the Commission welcomes the agreement by the European Parliament and the Council on its proposal for a regulation on short selling and certain aspects of Credit Default Swaps (CDS). This regulation will grant regulators, including ESMA under certain conditions, clear powers to temporarily restrict short selling in exceptional situations, and will prohibit uncovered CDSs on sovereign debt in the Union. 2. Public oversight of the financial sector has been considerably strengthened, firstly by creating three European Supervisory Authorities, for banking, securities markets, and insurance and occupational pensions, with significant powers. Secondly, new legislation strengthens public control. For example, alternative investment fund managers are now regulated at EU level, which was not the case before. The Commission's legislative proposal revising the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), presented in October, extends MiFID's regulatory framework to types of trading venues which fell outside the scope of the existing MiFID, increases transparency in financial markets, and boosts sanctions for violations.
