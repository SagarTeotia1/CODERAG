ORAL QUESTION H-0168/08 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Colm Burke to the Commission Subject: Food traceability Food traceability is a cornerstone of the EU's food safety policy, and consumers in the EU expect clear information. It has come to my attention that, in my own Member State, there are cases where food products are marketed in a way which gives a misleading impression as to the source of the raw material. Can the Commission comment on whether it is aware of such concerns, and whether any action can be expected on enhancing food traceability?
