EMPL Cancer and long-term illness patients at the workplace The study aims at gaining understanding of the barriers but also of the facilitating factors enhancing the reintegration of chronically sick and absent workers. It also highlights the characteristics of national legislations providing support for workers with long-term illnesses. The analysis of the different schemes and approaches indicates that all 27 Member States have a compulsory social/sickness insurance scheme, which is the main instrument to protect against the risk of poverty and exclusion. The duration of sickness benefit varies considerably across Europe, ranging from a minimum of 6 months to unlimited duration, the most common being up to 1 year of sick pay leave. As regards the long-term illness, the sickness benefit in most countries is substituted by other measures, such as invalidity pension. The rate of return to work varies greatly (ranging from 30% to 93%) depending on several factors, in particular on sectors and types of job, duration of sick leave, the site and type of cancer, the work and social environment. The economic burden of a sick worker includes the lost productivity of those who quit work and the cost linked to the possible pauperisation of the worker and his/her family for the next years. An early retirement or invalidity pension is a costly measure because it represents a significant loss of human resources and results in a form of exclusion, measure which sometimes may not be compatible with the need for a sustainable welfare system. Members focused on the need of a common definition covering the persons who suffer from long-term illness or cancer, as in most Member States a distinction between disability and illness is made. From a legal point of view, a clarification is needed for the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of disability to cover discrimination on the grounds of illness. 20080930CAN38400 Study
