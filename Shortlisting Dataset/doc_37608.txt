Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (31 May 2010) The Commission assesses the status of interconnectors in the context of relevant EU legislation. Article 2(13) of Directive 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC, OJ L 211, 14.8.2009. defines an interconnector as ‘equipment used to link electricity systems’. Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) 714/2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross border exchanges in electricity Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, OJ L 211, 14.8.2009. defines an interconnector as ‘a transmission line which crosses or spans a border between Member States and which connects the national transmission systems of the Member States’. These definitions are unchanged from those which applied respectively in Directive 2003/54/EC and Regulation (EC) 1228/2003. An undersea electricity cable such as the one described between between Norway and Germany constitutes an interconnector as defined in Regulation (EC) 714/2009. According to Article 1(a) of the regulation, it aims at ‘setting fair rules for cross border exchanges in electricity …’ The regulation sets out rules governing charges for access to the cross border transmission system, including interconnectors. Where certain criteria are met, the regulation also provides for exemptions from these rules for new interconnectors on a case by case basis and subject to the approval of the Commission. Similar rules applied also in the regulation (EC) 1228/2003. The Commission does not consider it to be either necessary or appropriate to amend these definitions which were recently confirmed by the legislator. Both Directive 2003/54/EC and Regulation (EC) 1228/2003 were adopted as EEA law as set out in Annex IV to the EEA Agreement. Norway has indicated that it intends to similarly adopt Directive 2009/72/EC and Regulation (EC) 714/2009. The EFTA European Free Trade Association. Surveillance Authority ensures that the participating EFTA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway respect their obligations under the EEA Agreement. In monitoring and enforcing the Agreement, the Authority has powers that correspond to those of the Commission and there is close contact and cooperation between the Commission and the Authority.
