question, without needing to apply for a work permit. Parliament is only being consulted on this legislation and any amendments it adopts are non-binding on the Council of Ministers. MEPs are urging that mandatory provisions be added on family reunification so that direct family members (spouse or partner, children under 21 or dependent parents) will have the right to join the researcher. The Council wants these measures to be optional for Member States. MEPs would also like the researcher to have full access to the national sickness insurance scheme. MEPs see mobility as an essential factor in the transfer of knowledge and formation of scientists’ networks, so they passed an amendment to allow the visa holder to conduct part of his/her research work in another Member State. However if the researcher wishes to stay there for more than three months, the second Member State may require a new hosting agreement. This new directive will be a small but crucial step in the achievement of the ambitious agenda set in Lisbon and Barcelona in 2002, where Member States committed themselves to invest 3% of the national GDP in research and recruit 700,000 researchers in Europe by 2010.

With this consultation report MEPs give their support to the draft Decision on procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings by identifying five areas in which common standards may be applied by all Member States to protect the rights of suspected persons: the right to immediate access to a lawyer; access to interpretation or translation so that they enjoy the same standard of legal treatment as they would at home; ensuring that persons in need of specific attention because they are unable to follow the proceedings receive it; consular assistance to foreign detainees and notifying suspects and defendants of their rights in writing. Under the new EU Constitution, all Member States will have to abide by judgements handed down by other national legal systems within the EU. At the same time, membership of the EU will entail an obligation to treat all European citizens " in a comparable fashion ", a principle which will also apply to judicial proceedings.
