Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2005) The Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC Directive 2000/60/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000 defines an environmental objective, i.e. achieving/maintaining good status for all waters, rivers and lakes, groundwaters and coastal waters. It does not entail any provisions on property ownership. The Commission would in this context like to recall the provisions of the EC Treaty, Article 295 ‘This Treaty shall in no way prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership.’
