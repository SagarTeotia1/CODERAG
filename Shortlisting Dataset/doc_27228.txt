WRITTEN QUESTION E-0588/09 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Commission (9 February 2009) Subject: Corruption in African countries According to estimates by the African Union, corruption costs Africa some USD 150 billion per annum. This is equivalent to a quarter of Africa's total gross domestic product (‘Afrika verliert jährlich 148 Milliarden Dollar durch Korruption’, der Standard.at, 23 February 2006). Does the Commission have any studies of the prevalence of corruption in African countries? Do they corroborate this claim? What measures has the Commission already taken in this connection?
