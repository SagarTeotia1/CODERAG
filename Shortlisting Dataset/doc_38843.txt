WRITTEN QUESTION E-2949/07 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (14 June 2007) Subject: Vulture funds In its answer to Questions P‑1431/07 and E‑1927/07, the Commission states that it is ‘ready to support any suitable (…) initiative aimed at reducing the activities of vulture funds’. Will the Commission itself draw up a plan for this and submit it to the other institutions and the international community? If so, what exactly does it have in mind? If not, why not?
