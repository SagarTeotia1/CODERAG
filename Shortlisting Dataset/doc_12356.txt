Answer given by Ms Kuneva on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2009) The Commission has been aware of the practices operated by certain business directory companies for some time and has replied to numerous complaints from companies in addition to a number of letters from Members of Parliament as well as written and oral questions on this issue (see, for example, E‑1572/08 by Mrs de Veyrac, E‑318/08 by Mr Evans, E‑812/07 by Mr de Rossa, E‑1374/06 by Mr de Mote, E‑1960/06 by Mrs Jackson and E‑2788/06 by Mr de Rossa). The only piece of EU legislation which is relevant to this problem is Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising Directive 2006/114/EC of the Parliament and of the Council concerning misleading and comparative advertising OJ L 376, 27.12.2006. This directive repealed and replaced as of 12 December 2007 by Council Directive 84/450/EEC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, OJ L 250, 19.9.1984. . The enforcement of this legislation is the responsibility of the competent national courts and/or public enforcement authorities who should decide on a case-by-case basis whether a commercial communication is misleading and, where appropriate, take enforcement action. In addition to the protection under the national laws transposing Directive 2006/114/EC there are other areas of law, such as criminal law, which are not harmonised at Community level and may possibly be relied upon at a national level. The Commission has attempted to increase awareness of the problem in its contacts with European business organisations. For instance, on 4 February 2009, it provided information on the extent of the problem and how to avoid it to nearly 600 members of the Enterprise Europe Network www.enterprise-europe-network.ec.europa.eu . The issue has been also discussed during the regular meetings of the SME Envoy with the SME representative organisations. In addition, on 13 October 2008, the Commission raised the problem with the Steering Group of the e-Business Support Network for e-Business policy coordination http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/e-bsn/index_en.html . The Commission has also written to the competent Ministers in the Member States most affected. In these letters the Commission raised awareness concerning the complaints received so far and asked a number of specific questions with a view to receiving more detailed information on how national authorities are addressing such issues. From the replies received, it is clear that the national authorities are aware of the problem, have legislation in place to take action and where relevant, have already done so. Finally, the Parliament adopted a Resolution on this problem on 16 December 2008 Parliament Resolution of 16 December 2008 on misleading directory companies (Petitions 0045/2006, 1476/2006, 0079/2003, 0819/2003, 1010/2005, 0052/2007, 0306/2007, 0444/2007, 0562/2007 and others) ( P6_TA(2008)0608 ). . The follow-up fiche the Commission has transmitted officially to Parliament on 22 April 2009 is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat.
