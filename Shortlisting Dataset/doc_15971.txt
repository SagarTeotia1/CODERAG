The Safer Internet Plus programme is established for the period 2005-2008 to promote safer use of Internet and new online technologies, particularly for children. Its aim is also to fight against illegal content and content unwanted by the end user.

To ensure that the Programme is effective, hotlines are required in all Member States and candidate countries. Currently, hotlines exist in 13 of the 25 Member States. 2. Tackling unwanted and harmful content (10-17%) by means of funding for filtering technologies etc. 3. Promoting a safer environment (8-12%): the Safer Internet Forum to be developed in 2004 to provide codes of conduct. 4. Awareness-rising (47-51%) measures.
