Answer given by Ms Malström on behalf of the Commission (6 July 2010) The Commission is aware of the report of the United Kingdom's House of Commons Home Affairs Committee on e-Borders. After giving a number of commitments and assurances that allowed the Commission to conclude that e-Borders would be in line with EC law, the UK authorities drew our attention to the technical problems with the IT solutions used by some airlines to submit the passenger information which are not developed to allow for voluntary refusal by passengers to provide their data. A further meeting with the UK authorities on this issue is foreseen shortly.
