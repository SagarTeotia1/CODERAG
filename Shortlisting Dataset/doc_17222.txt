and coordinating the smooth changeover to the euro, a historically unique and complex undertaking. These achievements make us confident that the ECB will continue to meet its objectives and perform its tasks efficiently in the future. In my new capacity I intend to use my professional experience and devote all my energy to the success of this effort. In my introductory statement I have chosen not to speak in my native language so as to underline the supranational character of the ECB and to facilitate communication. I would like, however, to finish with a quote from Aristotle regarding the value of money. In his Politics (Book I, 1257 B10), he states: “Oτέ δε πάλιν λήρος είναι δοκεί το νόμισμα και νόμος παντάπασιν φύσει δ’ουθέν, ότι μεταθεμένων τε των χρωμένων ουθενός άξιον, ούτε χρήσιμον προς ουθέν των αναγκαίων εστί και νομίσματος πλουτών πολλάκις απορήσει της αναγκαίας τροφής”. This text can be freely translated as follows: “If those who employ a currency system choose to change the agreements upon which it is created, the currency ceases to have its value and although one could have plenty of money one could no longer use it to procure the necessities of life”. This quote shows that the value of money has been a major concern since ancient times. The overriding responsibility of the European Central Bank is to achieve its primary objective and secure the purchasing power of our single currency in the euro area. By doing so, it contributes in a fundamental way to the long-term growth of real incomes and employment and, more generally, to the social and economic welfare of the citizens of Europe. Thank you very much for your attention.
