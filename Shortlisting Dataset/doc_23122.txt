1999/C 348 E/148 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0697/99 by José García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE) to the Commission (26 March 1999) Subject: Structural Funds The regions whose level of income per inhabitant is less than 75 % of that which corresponds to the average Community inhabitant are classed as Objective 1 regions and are entitled to substantial Community aid. In order to work out whether this threshold has been crossed or not, the draft Council Regulation, COM(98) 0131 final OJ C 176, 9.6.1998, p. 1 . , laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, stipulates that the figures corresponding to the last three years on which Eurostat has information will be taken into account. The Director-General of the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) disclosed at the meeting of Parliament's Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs of 17 February 1999 that the statistical data corresponding to the financial years 1994, 1995 and 1996 already included the data corresponding to the hidden economy of the regions analysed, although he did not say exactly what criteria had been followed in order to estimate or assess this type of activity. What criteria is the Commission following in order to estimate the hidden economy of the various European regions?
