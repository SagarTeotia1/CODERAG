Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (2 April 2002) Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste OJ L 194, 25.7.1975 . , as amended by Council Directive 91/156/EEC of 18 March 1991 OJ L 78, 26.3.1991 . , aims to protect human health and environment against harmful effects caused by the collection, transport, treatment, storage and tipping of waste. The definition of waste is fixed in Article 1 a) of Directive 75/442/EEC as any substance or object in the categories set out in Annex I which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard. Excavated earth is waste for the purposes of the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 75/442/EEC ), Article 1a). It falls within the concept of discard. This is so even if the excavated earth is inert and/or (as would be hoped and expected) is to be reused later. It is important to note that excavated earth without proper management does present actual or potential environmental adverse impact in terms of disruption of soil base, potential dangers of mound slides etc. The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 91/156/EEC , has drawn up a list of wastes belonging to the categories listed in Annex I (European Waste Catalogue (EWC)). Chapter 17 of Commission Decision 2001/118/EC of 16 January 2001, amending Decision 2000/532/EC as regards the list of wastes OJ L 47, 16.2.2001 . , is entitled: Construction and demolition wastes (including excavated soil from contaminated sites). Soil and stones containing dangerous substances and soil and stones other than those containing dangerous substances are included in this chapter (EWC codes 17 05 03 and 17 05 04). In 1997, the Commission already challenged Italian legislation which excluded, at Article 8, paragraph 2, letter c, of Decreto Legislativo 5 febbraio 1997 No 22 (first version) transposing waste Community directives, the non hazardous materials derived from digging activity from the scope of application of Italian waste legislation. This exclusion has then been repealed by the next version of the Italian decree. In the light of the above, the Italian law No 443 of 21 December 2001, which prohibits excavated soil and stones from being defined as waste, even if it is contaminated, could be in breach of the Community waste legislation. The Commission will take the appropriate steps in order to verify the compliance with Community law in the specific case. Should the Commission identify a breach of Community law, it would not hesitate, as the guardian of the EC Treaty, to take all necessary measures conferred on it by the EC Treaty, including infringement procedures under Article 226 of the EC Treaty, in order to ensure the compliance with relevant Community law.
