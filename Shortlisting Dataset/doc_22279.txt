Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (13 December 2011) Based on the specific indicators prescribed by the Europe 2020 strategy, all but one Member State have set national poverty targets, with a number of countries also specifying sub-targets for specific populations such as children, elderly or youth. As not all Member States have based their national targets on the EU indicator, the estimation of the overall ambition is difficult. A first evaluation shows that the sum of national poverty targets is around 12 million people to be lifted out of poverty by 2020. If spill-over effects of strategies focusing on, for example, combating child poverty or reducing long-term unemployment are taken into account, this number can be increased by 25 %, but that still falls short at least by 5 million or 25 % of the EU headline target. As poverty levels have increased in many countries due to the crisis, the achievement of the target is becoming even more challenging. The Commission, in line with the objectives of the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, has been engaged in various activities that aim at reducing poverty and social exclusion in the EU. Among others the Commission has just recently adopted a recommendation on access to basic accounts See: http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/ia_carried_out/docs/ia_2011/c_2011_4977_en.pdf , and plans to adopt another recommendation on child poverty in 2012. A full list of initiatives can be found in the accompanying document to the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion See: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SEC:2010:1564:FIN:EN:PDF . The Commission has also proposed in the regulation on the European Social Fund 2014-2020 COM(2011) 607 final. that at least 20 % of the European Social Fund allocation in each Member State should be dedicated to the objective of promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. The need to protect the vulnerable and respond to the social consequences of the economic crisis has also been emphasised in the Annual Growth Survey 2012 See: http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/ags2012_en.pdf . It should, however, be noted that the primary responsibility for fighting poverty remains with the Member States.
