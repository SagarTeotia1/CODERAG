accordance with their basic texts; takes the view that there is a need to review all texts that go against this principle; 2. Finds table 1 of the Court of Auditors' report, introduced for the first time during the 2003 discharge exercise, which summarises the Centre's powers and responsibilities, governance, resources, activities and services provided, of great value; notes that the information contained in table 1 is supplied by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction; asks the Court of Auditors to verify the contents of table 1; 3. Insists that as well as spending money properly, agencies should also strive to spend money as efficiently and effectively as possible; invites the Court of Auditors to consider the possibility of extending its specific annual reports on the agencies to include an examination of performance and achievement of objectives; in this context and in line with its resolutions on the 2003 discharge, insists that the following aspects be taken into account: duplication of work among the agencies must be avoided as much as possible, and measures designed to improve transparency and communication with the public must be clarified, along with Community affirmative action measures at all levels of recruitment, training and the assignment of responsibilities; 4. Notes that Community agencies do not always have a good image or good press and that many of them do not deserve such a negative image; points out that EU citizens should be made aware of this, with appropriate means being used to explain as often as is necessary the raisons d’être and achievements of the agencies; calls on the Commission to act accordingly using whatever means it considers necessary; 5. Notes that the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 has affected the structures and operating arrangements of the Community agencies in many ways, and that several of the agencies draw attention to these effects in their activity reports, focusing in particular on the increase in the number of administrators; calls on the Commission to assess the real or supposed problems encountered and to recommend the regulatory changes required; 6. Notes that the Commission has made a commitment to harmonising the way in which activity reports concerning its directorates-general are presented; calls for a similar approach to be taken in respect of the activity reports of the Community’s agencies, which differ significantly in terms of content; calls on the Commission to point out to the Community’s agencies the information and activity indicators that they must provide; 7. Is pleased to note that the Court of Auditors has been able to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 are reliable and that the underlying transactions, taken as a whole, are legal and regular; 8. Regrets the very high level of transfers made; urges the Centre to respect more closely the budget originally set by the budgetary authority; 9. Notes the Court of Auditors' finding of a number of anomalies in the management of contracts; welcomes the steps taken by the Centre to improve the management of contracts;
