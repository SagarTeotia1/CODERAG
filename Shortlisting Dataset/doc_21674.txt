WRITTEN QUESTION P-1600/06 by Marcin Libicki (UEN) to the Commission (11 April 2006) Subject: Commission President's statement on Poland's appeal against the Commission decision to authorise the merger between the Pekao SA and BPH banks, and threat to the independence of the NBP On 20 March 2006, in a statement to the Associated Press on the Polish Government's appeal against the Commission's decision to authorise the merger between the Pekao SA and BPH banks, the President of the Commission said that when ‘you launch a procedure in the European Court of Justice against the European Commission’ or when ‘at least in terms of perception the autonomy of the central bank is put in question, this is certainly not the best way to show engagement with our European model’. Given the above statement, would the Commission answer the following questions. 1. On what does the President of the Commission base his statement that a Member State making use of the procedure laid down in the Treaties for appealing to the Court of Justice against a Commission decision is undermining the ‘European model’, and does the Commission take the view that the ‘European model’ means that Member States must completely surrender this Treaty-enshrined prerogative? 2. Are the media pronouncements that individual Commissioners are constantly making on domestic events in Member States instead of concentrating on efficiently carrying out the Commission's appointed tasks — such as concluding infringement procedures that have been dragging on for years — the Commission's way of showing commitment to the ‘European model’?
