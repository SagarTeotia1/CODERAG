Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (20 January 2005) The German toll operator ‘Toll Collect’ offers three possibilities to pay the toll: by an on-board unit (OBU), by Internet or at a terminal. Frequent users who are not using the OBU can nonetheless facilitate the booking procedure by getting the basic data of their vehicles registered in the system. In addition to these three possibilities a private service provider offers the toll booking via telephone. The installation of OBUs is not limited to German transport operators. Moreover the network of workshops to install OBUs does not cover only Germany. As a matter of fact Toll Collect has set-up a network of 1500 workshops (service partners) in Germany and 350 in neighbouring countries. The idea of expanding the network of service partners in other countries has been developed and is being discussed between the Commission, the German Ministry of Transport and road hauliers associations. The plan should be put in place in the first half of 2005, so that a feasible solution is found to better satisfy operators in countries not bordering Germany. In the meantime the existing 1850 workshops can be visited for the installation of OBUs.
