Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (10 August 2010) 1. As regards the approach of Mexico towards the incident, the Mexican federal government has been keeping track of the oil spill via its federal Agency ‘The Secretary for the Environment and Natural Resources’. A special commission was created in order to develop a strategy and an action plan for the permanent observance, prevention and response to the possible damages on Mexican territorial waters and coast line. As of 8 June 2010, the official sources did not report any direct impact of the spill in Mexican waters. More details are available on the website of Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (Semarnat). 2. Considering that the accident in the Gulf of Mexico has not taken place in an area under EU's jurisdiction, the Commission is not in a position to hold BP accountable for the disaster. However, the Commission is following closely action taken by the US authorities, within whose jurisdiction the spill has occurred. BP has accepted responsibility for the incident in the Gulf of Mexico, and the US authorities are following the matter in accordance with the US legal system. 3. As regards the EU assistance to the USA, the Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its earlier reply to Written Question E‑4622/10 by Mr Jørgensen http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/ .
