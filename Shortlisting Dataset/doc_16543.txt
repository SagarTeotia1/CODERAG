Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2009) The questions raised by the Honourable Member are addressed in Articles 2(2), 2(4), and 9(4)c of Directive No 2008/96/EC COM(2008)0096 final. on Road Infrastructure Safety Management. These provisions establish basic principles so as to ensure competent, impartial and objective safety inspections and audits. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the directive, the bodies carrying out inspections and audits may be either newly created or pre-existing bodies. However, it should be emphasised that in accordance with the requirements of Article 9(4)c, the auditor may not at the time of the audit be involved in the conception or operation of the relevant infrastructure project.
