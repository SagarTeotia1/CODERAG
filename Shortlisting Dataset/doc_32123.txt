WRITTEN QUESTION E-2424/04 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (11 October 2004) Subject: Forest fires in Andalucia Some 30000 hectares have been destroyed by forest fires in the provinces of Huelva (affecting the villages of Berrocal, Paterna del Campo, Las Delgadas, Escacena del Campo, Nerva and Minas de Río Tinto) and Seville (El Madroño, Castillo de las Guardas, El Álamo, Aznalcóllar, El Garrabo and Gerena, inter alia). This ecological and economic catastrophe has destroyed one of the largest of western Andalucia's ‘green lungs’. 1. Is the Commission aware of the situation? 2. Can it request an investigation into the scale, causes and consequences of the disaster? 3. Does it believe that the Spanish authorities should declare the villages affected by the fires a disaster area? 4. What urgent measures can the Commission take, either via the Spanish authorities or at European level, to compensate those affected, who include professionals involved in farming, stock-breeding and forestry? 5. Does the Commission not believe that an emergency plan, similar to that adopted following the Prestige Disaster, should be established for the areas affected by forest fires? 6. Has the Commission visited the areas affected by the fires so as to assess the consequences?
