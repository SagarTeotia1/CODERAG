WRITTEN QUESTION E-5803/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (27 October 2008) Subject: Public transport in Cyprus Cyprus’s public transport policy appears to be in disarray. As a consequence, public transport in Cyprus is of a very low standard. This sorry state of affairs has serious effects on the daily lives of citizens and on the environment. Is the Commission aware of the problematic area of public transport in Cyprus? And does the Commission intend to help/advise the Cyprus authorities on ways and means to help significantly improve public transportation on the island as soon as possible?
