WRITTEN QUESTION E-5675/07 by Françoise Grossetête (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (15 November 2007) Subject: Levels of aluminium used as adjuvant in vaccines It is highly probable that aluminium, which is used as an adjuvant in vaccines, is the factor that has triggered macrophagic myofasciitis. Patients complain of muscular pain and chronic fatigue. Suspicion currently centres on the vaccine against hepatitis B. The number of patients recorded in France shows a rising trend, but they are still seen as isolated cases and are being kept poorly informed. The progress of the disease is currently almost impossible to predict, and specialists appear to be making light of certain incapacitating symptoms. The European standard relating to the aluminium threshold that should not be exceeded in vaccines has apparently been set at 15 mg/litre. However, frequently‑used vaccines, namely the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio and the hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines, apparently contain aluminium in quantities of 650 to 1250 mg/litre. What are the maximum quantities of aluminium that are permissible as an adjuvant in vaccines? Could the Commission specify whether the permissible aluminium content has been changed — once or more — at the European level between 1994 and October 2007?
