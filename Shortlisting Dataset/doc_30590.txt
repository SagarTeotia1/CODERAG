Question for Question Time H-000020/2011 to the Council Part-session: February 2011 Rule 116 Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė (PPE) Subject: Crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe The Commission's Report on the memory of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe (COM(2010)0783) contains good proposals on how to preserve and promote the memory at EU level. The Commission also states that this issue will be kept under review, which is of utmost importance. Reconciliation of European Histories is important for the solidarity and unity of the EU, as also stressed in the letter to Commissioner Reding signed by six Foreign Affairs Ministers (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania) and another signed by the Estonian and Polish Ministers of Justice. What steps are envisaged to be taken by the Presidency to ensure implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report? Does the Presidency plan to have a discussion on the issue at the Justice and Home Affairs Council? How does the Presidency plan to encourage a discussion and sharing of experiences and best practices in order to keep alive the memory of atrocities committed by totalitarian regimes?
