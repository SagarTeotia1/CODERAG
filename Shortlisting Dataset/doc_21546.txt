Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2009) Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on social rules in the road transport sector Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 3821/85 and (EC) No 2135/98 and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85, OJ L 102, 11.4.2006. , applicable since 11 April 2007, does not introduce new restrictions as regards the regular weekly rest period of at least 45 hours compared with the preceding Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 of 20 December 1985 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport, OJ L 370, 31.12.1985. which had been in force for more than 20 years. These rules have been adopted in order to improve road safety, guarantee adequate social standards for drivers and ensure fair competition. While it is important, therefore, to have harmonised rules, a certain amount of flexibility is also necessary and possible. In this respect, in any two consecutive weeks one regular weekly rest period may be replaced with a reduced weekly rest of 24 hours, provided that the reduction is compensated by an equivalent period of rest taken before the end of the third week following the week in question, as it was the case under the previous Regulation as well. Furthermore, in order to take account of the specific features of the fishing industry, the regulation allows Member States, under certain conditions, to grant exceptions from the rules on driving time and rest periods for vehicles used or hired by fishery undertakings for carrying goods, as part of their own entrepreneurial activity, within a radius of 100 km from the base of the undertaking. The Commission monitors implementation of these social rules and publishes a report every second year. The most recent report was published on 3 August 2009 Report from the Commission on the implementation in 2005-2006 of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport, COM(2009)416 final. .
