Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (24 March 2011) The issue of industrial espionage raised by the Honourable Member is indeed an important challenge for companies which are at the forefront of research and innovation and which therefore create important technological advantages for Europe. The Commission has not taken measures to combat industrial espionage, because there has so far not been a necessity to regulate this issue at European level. It is therefore currently in the responsibility of the Member States to take the measures they consider adequate to respond to this threat. The Commission has, on the other hand, adopted legal instruments for the protection of intellectual property rights in the EU and for trade with third countries. The Member States and the EU also took part in the negotiation of the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement (ACTA) recently finalised. This is an important element with view to the protection of new technologies, as was raised in the question. In the framework of (service or works) contracts and grant agreements it concludes with external partners (industry, firms, academia, consultants, etc), the Commission makes sure that the contractors or grant beneficiaries comply with the basic principles and minimum common standards and requirements for protecting sensitive and classified information or material against unauthorised disclosure, acts of sabotage or espionage which may jeopardise the confidentiality, availability or integrity of such information or material. These basic principles and requirements are laid down in Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 29 November 2001 amending its internal Rules of Procedure OJ L 317, 3.12.2001. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:317:0001:0055:EN:PDF , and in particular Section 27 of the security provision annexed to this decision, which contain the provisions on industrial security.
