Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (26 September 2007) The Advisory Group to the Commission President on energy and climate change is a group of external experts, invited by the President to give him advice on the nexus between energy and climate change issues. It is an advisory group with the objective to provide independent and informal advice to the President. They are a mix of energy and climate experts, with a range of disciplines, coming from a range of different Member States. The purpose is to have an open debate. The idea is to draw on the vast, and often unique, experience of these independent experts, so that the European Union remains at the forefront of the debate. The group meets occasionally.
