WRITTEN QUESTION E-1976/06 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (4 May 2006) Subject: Use of palm oil as a fuel With the publication in December 2005 of its biofuels action plan, which aims to increase the use of alternative and renewable sources of energy from forestry, agriculture and waste materials in order to reduce European carbon emissions, is the Commission aware of the increased use of palm oil as a fuel? Is the Commission also aware of the intensive growth of palm for the production of palm oil in locations that are considered unsuitable and in ways which are considered unsustainable and as having a damaging effect on wildlife — particularly orang-utans? What action has the Commission taken already or will it consider taking in order to promote only the use of palm oil from genuinely sustainable and renewable sources?
