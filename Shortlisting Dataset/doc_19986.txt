los poderes a la OLAF. MINORITY OPINION pursuant to rule 161(3) of the Rules of Procedure Mónica Ridruejo, member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs Based on Art 161.3 of the European Parliament Rules of Procedure, I want to say that: “The Report, as amended, fundamentally alters my Draft. Based on information available, changes introduced are unfounded. An MEP limited amendments to the transmission of EIB arguments to cover up its defficiencies. Other MEPs seem not to conceive that EMAC can exercise a real control over the EIB. No data suggests my Draft is inaccurate. None contradicts Draft denunciations on EIB´s serious management, transparency and accountability defficiencies. None suggest improvements to recommendations proposed, to correct them. In fact, there has been no debate on its content. Most amendments are based on the idea that the priority is to keep a friendly dialogue with EIB, even if at the cost of permitting EIB to keep using the fiction of parliamentary control as guarantor of its practices. I believe MEPs must promote the construction of a solid, efficient and transparent Europe, defending citizens´ interests, without bending to lobby pressure. Having information on irregularities and not denouncing them makes one an accomplice. Detecting issues needing substantial improvement, without recommending clear actions to correct them, is not fulfilling EMAC objectives and undermining European citizens´confidence in the Parliament. I do not want to appear as accomplice of this attitude. I withdraw my name from this Report.”
