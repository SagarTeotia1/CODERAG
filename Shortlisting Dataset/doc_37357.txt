Question for written answer E-011724/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jan Březina (PPE) (12 December 2011) Subject: New rules on online privacy In March 2011, Commissioner Reding delivered a speech in Parliament that set forth a new ‘right to be forgotten’ and a ‘burden of proof’ that should be imposed on online companies to justify why they need to store personal data. She made only passing reference to this towards the end of her speech, stating that the ‘right to be forgotten’ should build on existing rules. If individuals do not want their data to be stored any longer, and there is no legitimate need for the company to keep it, then data should be removed. Why did the Commission soften its stance on the ‘right to be forgotten’? How would the Commission refute the assumption that this stance is in the interests of online companies and not in line with the interests of consumers?
