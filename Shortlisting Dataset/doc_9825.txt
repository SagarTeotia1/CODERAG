Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (7 July 2005) As the Honourable Member states in his question, Andorra is one of the EU’s cooperation partners. The cooperation will be extended as from 1 July 2005 to several sectors, through the entry into force of the EU-Andorra cooperation agreement, and the agreement on taxation of savings. Both agreements were signed on 15 November 2004. Andorra as a sovereign country, has established its own legal system. Conditions of nationals of EU Member States living and working in Andorra are governed by the Andorran laws. An agreement on the free movement of persons between the European Union and Andorra does not exist at the moment, due to Andorra’s unwillingness to negotiate such an agreement. The cooperation agreement contains a non-discrimination clause (Article 5) covering the EU workers legally resident on its territory, as regards working conditions, pay and redundancy. The Commission has no knowledge of any abuse of power by the authorities in Andorra.
