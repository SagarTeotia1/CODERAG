Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2005) Following its investigations, the Commission can confirm that, as regards the wood intended to be built permanently into the Berlaymont: 1. Throughout the renovation, S.A. Berlaymont 2000 took great care not to use wood that had been logged illegally or in a way that harmed the environment. 2. All the data sheets provided for this wood by the contractors used by S.A. Berlaymont 2000 confirm that the wood was logged legally and in an environmentally friendly manner. 3. None of the random sampling checks carried out during the renovation of the Berlaymont indicated that wood had been logged illegally or in a way that harmed the environment. 4. Neither did more targeted checks indicate that wood had been logged illegally or in a way that harmed the environment. As regards the wood used for temporary structures (e.g. formwork, temporary protection of surfaces, construction of temporary supports, etc.), S.A. Berlaymont 2000’s contractors were not subject to the same requirement not to use wood that had been logged illegally or in a way that harmed the environment. Consequently, for financial reasons, those contractors used other types of wood, which has since been removed from the site and the Berlaymont building. The Commission will amend the specifications for its renovation projects to ensure that the wood used for temporary structures and purposes is also logged legally and in an environmentally friendly manner.
