main objectives of EU 2020 strategy; calls for an ambitious long-term strategy against poverty with far-reaching targets for poverty reduction, including for women, children and, the elderly and for in-work poverty, including a coordinated strategy on housing in Europe; 22. Recalls, in respect of the poverty reduction target, its earlier proposals for an EU target for minimum income schemes and contributory replacement income schemes providing income support of at least 60% of national median equalised income, and agreement on a timetable for achieving this target in all; 23. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to establish, on the basis of the headline targets on employment rate and poverty reduction, a set of sub-targets at EU and national level, to be followed up by concrete policies and monitoring mechanisms, including indicators; 24.
