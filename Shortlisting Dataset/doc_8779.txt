for the period during which the administrative reform is to be implemented; Standards of behaviour in public life 6. Notes the establishment of a set of codes of conduct for the Commission (code of conduct for Commissioners, code of conduct governing relations between Commissioners and departments and code of good administrative behaviour for Commission staff in their relations with the public); reiterates its view that these texts should have a legal basis; calls, therefore, on the Commission to incorporate the first two codes referred to into its Rules of Procedure pursuant to Article 218(2) of the EC Treaty, as it has just done in its decision of 17 October 2000 amending its Rules of Procedure OJ L 267, 20.10.2000, p. 63. for the third code of conduct, and to make provision for sanctions in the event of non-compliance; 7. Welcomes the Commission's proposal to establish, by means of an interinstitutional agreement, a committee on standards in public life; considers that such a committee should have a purely advisory role, and that its membership should be subject to approval by the European Parliament; considers that this committee should play a different role towards different groups within the institutions, and that, in particular, the independence of Members of the European Parliament and Parliament as an institution must be guaranteed; also takes note of the introduction of sectoral codes, such as the code of ethics for staff in the Internal Audit Service (IAS) (see Action 68); stresses that this proliferation of codes should not result in confusion and lack of clarity as regards the rules in force and stresses the importance of ensuring that these codes are consistent with staff regulations (see Actions 55 and 56); 8. Notes the drawing up of a regulation on public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents to be adopted under the codecision procedure, which will replace the existing codes of conduct of the three institutions in this area; rejects the restrictive nature of the Commission proposal and insists that the provisions in the regulation respect the right to access enshrined in Article 255 of the EC Treaty; rejects the recent decision by the Council to exclude an entire category of documents from the existing rules governing access to documents; Framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission 9. Points out that it will judge the recent framework agreement between the two institutions Texts Adopted of 5.7.2000, Item 9. on its merits in practice; in this connection, stresses its determination to safeguard its right pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 197 of the EC Treaty and also its right of access to Commission documents, so as to perform fully the role assigned to it, in particular by Article 276(2) of the EC Treaty; Speeding up payments 10. Accords the utmost importance to speeding up the payment of sums due by the Commission, currently subject to frequently unacceptable delays; calls on the Commission to take steps to ensure that the target it has set (payment in 60 days for 95% of invoices by 2002 - see Action 10) can
