WRITTEN QUESTION E-2688/05 by Silvana Koch-Mehrin (ALDE) to the Commission (20 July 2005) Subject: Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 21 March 2002 on the imposition of turnover tax on the annual subscriptions paid to non-profit-making organisations by members On 21 March 2002, the Court of Justice of the European Communities handed down a judgment on the imposition of turnover tax on members' subscriptions to non-profit-making organisations. It found that the annual subscriptions paid by members of non-profit-making organisations can constitute the consideration for the services provided, whether or not the members actually use or have used the facilities provided. Pursuant to Directive 77/388/EEC OJ L 145, 13.6.1977, p. 1 . on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes, non-profit-making organisations are, therefore, also liable to turnover tax. In general terms, Article 13A(1)(m) of Directive 77/388/EEC authorises the Member States to exempt certain activities in the public interest from value added tax, although the question arises as to the extent to which such exemption adversely affects competitive neutrality. Is the Commission aware of this issue? In the Commission's view, what are the implications of Directive 77/388/EEC for non-profit-making organisations? What is the Commission's opinion of the judgment? Does the Commission have any plans to submit a legislative proposal in connection with that judgment?
