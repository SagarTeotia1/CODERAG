Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (7 June 2005) Pending a settlement to the Cyprus problem, the application of the acquis has been suspended pursuant to Article 1(1) of Protocol No 10 of the Act of Accession 2003 in those areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control. In consequence, the areas mentioned, in which the Turkish Cypriot community lives, are not part of the internal market as they are outside the fiscal and customs territory of the European Union (EU). For this reason the Commission does not share the view of the Honourable Member that internal market rules are violated by the Republic of Cyprus as regards trade with those areas. The Commission draws the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that, trade across the line between these areas and the government-controlled areas is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 of 29 April 2004 on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol No 10 of the Act of Accession OJ L 161, 30.4.2004 . . As regards direct trade in products originating in areas not under the effective control of the Cypriot Government, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council regulation COM(2004)466 final. on 7 July 2004 which has not been adopted by the Council to date.
