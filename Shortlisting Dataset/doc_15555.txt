for Safety and Interoperability (06 02 08) Administrative appropriations under Titles 1 and 2 rise by 12,2 % to EUR 12 400 000, commitments and payments while operational appropriations under Title 3, both commitment and payment, rise by 24,9 % to EUR 4 245 000. As yet there is no contribution to expenditure from third countries. The aim in 2007 is to strengthen its expertise to support the Commission in the area of implementation of EC legislation on rail interoperability and a European Railway Traffic Management System. For all three agencies above increases in Titles 1 and 2 appropriations are connected to start up costs, transfers of headquarters, getting up to establishment plan strength and the uptake, as planned of new responsibilities in their respective fields. Trans European Networks - Executive Agency (06 01 04 31) There is as yet no legal basis for this agency. The Commission proposes EUR 8 617 000 in non differentiated appropriations for 2007, a 28,3 % increase. The Agency would be a management and technical body which would also verify the conformity of projects to the assistance rules. Transport Safety (06 02 03) Here a sharp reduction of 44,7 % in commitment appropriations and 15,1 % in payment appropriations is proposed (from EUR 18 080 000 to EUR 10 000 000 and EUR 17 080 000 to EUR 14 500 000, respectively). The history of this line is one of low utilisation of appropriations. The Commission argues that many of its tasks are now undertaken by the various agencies and that few European projects have been proposed upon which its funds could be spent. Nevertheless the sum proposed for commitments is lower than the amount used in 2005. Marco Polo II (06 02 06) This is the launch of a new programme within the frame of the Financial Framework for 2007-2013. The proposal is for EUR 55 775 000 in commitments and EUR 5 000 000 in payments in the programmes first year. The objective is to facilitate traffic transfer from road to other modes and to develop "motorways of the sea". When payment appropriations for Marco Polo II are added to those for Marco Polo I in 2007, expenditure is increased in 2007 by 29 %. A related line is Internal Market and the Optimisation of Transport Networks (06 02 04 01) This line is for the collection of data and statistics to aid interoperability and the development of intelligent transport systems. Commitment appropriations show a decrease of 27,8 % from EUR 9 000 000 to EUR 6 500 000. Galileo Supervisory Authority (06 02 09 01) A very sharp increase in commitment and payment appropriations of 159 % is included in the PDB for administration under Titles 1 and 2. Both go from EUR 2 500 000 in 2006 to EUR 5 800 000 in 2007. The increase in Title 3 appropriations, from EUR 2 500 000 to EUR 2 625 000, or 5 %, is considerably more modest. The overall increase is below that requested by the Agency. The Agency is wholly funded
