Supports the consolidation in the ENP of previously separated strands of foreign and assistance policy; looks for a strengthened network of institutional arrangements which is stable, economical and purposefully dedicated to developing closer economic integration and political association among all those involved, including the alignment of values within all international fora – especially the United Nations – with those of the European Union; 2. Stresses the need to decentralise the ENP with a view to involving more fully the societies of the countries concerned; welcomes, in this respect, the Commission’s commitment to building partnerships with societies through instruments such as the Civil Society Facility; 3. Welcomes the Commission’s intention to avoid duplication, to concentrate on strategic issues within the multilateral fora of the ENP and to use subregional and bilateral contacts for specific investment projects and cooperation programmes; calls for more effective use to be made of existing financial instruments so as to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from them; stresses the importance of building effective subregional partnerships within the wider Mediterranean region and continuing with similar efforts within the Eastern Partnership; 4. Recognises the challenges facing the project of the Union for the Mediterranean and acknowledges that it has not yet fulfilled its task and has not been instrumental in enhancing cooperation in the wider Mediterranean region; supports the current process of relaunching the Union for the Mediterranean, and, at the same time, emphasises that it should play a major role in the democratisation process which has commenced on the southern shore of the Mediterranean; takes the view that the process needs more attention and commitment from the Union, including steps to promote regional cooperation; therefore calls for a re-examination of the existing structures for regional cooperation and their adaptation to the needs arising as from the new situation, harnessing the full potential of the EEAS; insists in particular on the full incorporation of the European side of the partnership into the conventional EU framework under the auspices of the High Representative/Vice-President and the European External Action Service; 5. Stresses that, despite its challenges, the parliamentary dimension remains a very important component of the ENP, since it facilitates the exchange of experience as well as views, both of which are equally important to parliamentarism in the countries concerned; recommends that, in order to ensure the proper functioning of this dimension, a systematic assessment of the practical arrangements for EuroNest and the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly be undertaken with a view to improving them wherever possible; 6. Welcomes
