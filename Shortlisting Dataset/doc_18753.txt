Western European network; underlines the need for special attention for the development of a Baltic Interconnection Plan covering gas, electricity and storage in 2009; also supports the building of interconnections with islands, remote and isolated areas in the European Union; 23. Urges, for the same reasons, the development of the interconnections with South-Western Europe, especially from the Iberian peninsula to northern France; 24. Recalls that cross-border links already exist between various countries; observes that regional initiatives such as the Pentalateral Forum have devised usable practical solutions which increase the integration of the internal market; encourages those responsible for these initiatives to continue their successful work; 25. Calls on the Commission to propose adequate measures to encourage interconnection and development of electricity networks to allow for the optimised integration and balancing of fluctuating renewable energy production on- and offshore; 26. Welcomes the proposal to submit a plan for an offshore network in the North Sea in order to exploit its enormous wind energy potential; also welcomes in this connection the creation of a European supergrid by linking the network infrastructures of the North Sea, Mediterranean and Baltic regions; 27. Calls on the Commission and Member States to ensure appropriate regulation and to allow for non-discriminatory access to new infrastructure, for example, to the North Sea offshore grid; 28. 28 Believes that the EU must substantially and as rapidly as possible continue to increase its diversification and security in energy sources; calls on the Commission and on the Czech Presidency to present a new ambitious and far-sighted diversification plan to the next European Council; 29. Expresses its support for projects to diversify sources and routes of supply, particularly the development of a southern gas corridor including the Nabucco, the Turkey-Greece-Italy Gas Interconnector (TGI), and South Stream projects; stresses the need to work with the countries concerned, notably in the Caspian region; considers it of great importance that in the longer term, when political conditions permit, supplies from other countries in the region, such as Uzbekistan and Iran, should represent a further significant source of supply for the European Union; 30. Expresses also its support for the full interconnection of the Argelian-Spain-France and continental Europe MEDGAZ project, regarded by the Commission as a project of European interest in the Priority Interconnection Plan to further diversify entry gas routes to Europe; 31. Advocates, in view of the decline in domestic natural gas production and the change in the energy mix in many Member States, that all currently planned natural gas and electricity infrastructure projects be implemented rapidly in order to ensure that demand can still be met in future; 32. Considers that relations and partnerships with key energy suppliers, transit countries and consumer countries are important and must be deepened; points out, however, that the deepening of those relations and partnerships should in no circumstances take place to the detriment of the Union's founding values with regard, in particular, to respect for human rights; emphasises in this regard that the development of confidence and deeper and legally binding ties between the European Union and producer and
