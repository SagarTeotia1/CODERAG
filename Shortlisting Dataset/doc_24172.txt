ORAL QUESTION H-0901/05 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Richard Ashworth to the Council Subject: Court of Auditors Annual Report Later this week, the European Court of Auditors is due to produce its Annual Report on the EU accounts. For the past ten years, it has been unable to give a satisfactory statement of assurance. This is unacceptable. What steps have been taken by the UK Presidency to rectify this unsatisfactory state of affairs, and will the Council now give me an assurance that, next year, we may expect a positive statement of assurance on the EU's accounts?
