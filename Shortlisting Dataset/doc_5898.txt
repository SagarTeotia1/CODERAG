WRITTEN QUESTION P-0245/09 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (22 January 2009) Subject: Control measurements in French and European nuclear power plants In January, the French nuclear regulatory authority, ASN, took away responsibility for measurements in French nuclear plants from the nuclear operator, EDF, because of shortcomings in measurement methods and unreliable data. In the second half of 2008, ASN found that measurement methods had been departed from. According to a report in the newspaper ‘ Saarbrücker Zeitung ’, this also affects the Cattenom nuclear plant close to the border. 1. Is the Commission aware of this alarming development? 2. Does the Commission have information about out-of-the-ordinary or too high radioactivity readings in the border area between Germany and France? 3. Can the Commission verify whether there has been non-compliance with quality criteria only, or whether operators have gone so far as to gloss over radioactivity measurement results? 4. Does the Commission have information on how local residents and neighbouring countries are notified? Has the obligation to inform been met? 5. Does the Commission have information about similar incidents in other EU Member States? Have licences been withdrawn there, too, because of inaccurate measurement methods and data? 6. In the Commission's view, has the Euratom Treaty been infringed?
