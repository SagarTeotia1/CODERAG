WRITTEN QUESTION E-2529/06 by Gisela Kallenbach (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (9 June 2006) Subject: Trunk road 11 — relocation in Wurzen (Saxony) The highway authority of Döbeln-Torgau is currently building the B-6 Mulden bridge in Wurzen and intends to start work on the bypass (S11). The planned stretch of road passes through the natural protection area of the ‘Mittlere Mulde’, protected biotopes will be affected in the surrounding area and the road will cut through the priority natural and countryside area. The planned route will also entail sealing a significantly larger net area than the available alternatives, thereby destroying soil function in a previously unsealed site. 1. Can the Commission say whether it is true that the project ‘Trunk road 11 — relocation in Wurzen’ is being funded from ERDF appropriations at a rate of 75 %? If so, what amount of money is involved? 2. Does the Commission consider that promoting this project is compatible with the Structural Fund regulation and the horizontal task defined therein of the ‘enhancement and protection of the natural environment’? 3. How does the Commission assess the intrusion into a bird protection area and a countryside protection area, particularly in the light of possible alternative plans?
