Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2007) The Commission has not asked Member States to express their official position on the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), as the Commission's legislative proposal has not been tabled yet. As foreseen in the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2008 work will continue in order to establish an EU‑wide tax base. An impact assessment has been launched to examine the options and their implementation. If no unanimous agreement can be reached in the Council, as a last resort, consideration could be given to making use of the enhanced cooperation provisions (Article 43-45 of the Treaty on European Union). Under this approach providing certain conditions are met a group of Member States which intend to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of company taxation could address a request to the Commission, which may submit a proposal to the Council to that effect (Article 11.1 of the EC Treaty). As regards the main progress made since the publication of the May 2007 communication, technical discussions on the sharing mechanism have continued in a sub-group and in the main CCCTB Working Group (WG). A WG document setting out a possible outline of the principles of a CCCTB by bringing the basic structural elements of the base together into a coherent set of rules was discussed in the main CCCTB WG in September 2007 (‘CCCTB: Possible elements of a technical outline’ — CCCTB/WP/057 available on the DG TAXUD web pages http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/company_tax/common_tax_base/article_4381_en.htm ). Two similar outline documents on the sharing mechanism and on the administrative framework will be tabled at the next CCCTB WG meeting in December 2007.
