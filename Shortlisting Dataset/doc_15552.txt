enterprises — improvement of the financial environment for SMEs" will come to the end, meaning that there are no commitments but payments only for 2007. CIP will be launched in 2007 and a new line 01 04 04 has been created for its Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme. TITLE 02: ENTERPRISE Competitiveness, industrial policy, innovation and entrepreneurship (Chapter 02) The budget of this chapter has increased from EUR 73,74 million to EUR 145,86 million (increase of 97,82 %). This activity will be supported by the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme of the CIP which will cluster the corresponding financial resources available in 2007. Cooperation — Space and security (Chapter 04) The budget of this chapter has been increased from EUR 122,10 million to EUR 171,72 million (increase of 40,64%); FP7 will provide a substantial increase of resources. A new line (Security and Space Research - 02 04 01) has been created to cover all activities in this field. TITLE 06: ENERGY AND TRANSPORT Inland, air and maritime transport (Chapter 02) Activity of high importance for ITRE is the creation of a specific programme for Galileo (implementation phase, new line 06 02 10, EUR 100 million in commitment appropriations); and the development of the Galileo Supervisory Authority (line 06 02 09, increase of 68,5%). Trans-European networks (Chapter 03) The budgetary increase of 17,51% is linked to the management of the new programme for 2007-2013. "Financial support for projects of common interest in the trans-european energy network" (06 03 02) will be completed, and a new line has been created (06 03 04). Commitments under the old and the new line show continuity. Conventional and renewable energy (Chapter 04) The budget of this chapter has been slightly decreased from EUR 62,26 million to EUR 60,38 million (decrease of 3,01%). The "Intelligent Energy - Europe" programme will be completed and the "Intelligent Energy - Europe II" programme (new line 06 04 06) will be deployed as part of the CIP. The new programme is front-loaded; however commitments under the old and the new line show continuity. Nuclear energy (Chapter 05) The budget of this chapter has been increased from EUR 165,30 million to EUR 264,30 million (increase of 59,89%). This large increase is mainly in connection with the increase in line 06 05 05 of "Nuclear safety - transitory measures (decommissioning)" (EUR 143,200 million in 2006 and EUR 244 million in 2007), which is due to enlargement. TITLE 08: RESEARCH Cooperation This programme will cover research activities performed in trans-national cooperation; the 2007 budget provides continuity with actions already existing under FP6. Ideas This programme will be devoted to introducing a new dynamic in research by putting a premium on excellence through competition; a European Research Council will be sustained. These are newly conceived activities thus, the Commission proposal for 2007 budget must be read independently from the 2006 appropriations. People No major differences exist between the budget requested for this programme in 2007 and the FP6 2006 “Marie Curie” actions. Capacities The budget will be devoted to ensuring optimal use and development of research infrastructures. Under
