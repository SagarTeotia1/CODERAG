Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (26 September 2007) Regarding point 1, the Commission is not aware of the situation in the border area between Germany and the Netherlands. The Commission wishes to recall, however, that Directive 2002/49/EC Directive 2002/49/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise — Declaration by the Commission in the Conciliation Committee on the directive relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise, OJ L 189, 18.7.2002. requires strategic noise maps and action plans to be prepared with a view to managing rail noise emitted by railways with more than 30 000 trains per annum. According to this directive, Member States must cooperate on the action plans for border regions. As regards point 2, the Commission wishes to recall that the Commission Decision 2006/66/EC of 23 December 2005 2006/66/EC: Commission decision of 23 December 2005 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the subsystem rolling stock — noise of the trans-European conventional rail system ( notified under document number C(2005) 5666 ), OJ L 37, 8.2.2006. referred to by the Honourable Member limits noise from new locomotives. Regarding existing locomotives, the decision requires that noise is not increased following the renewal or upgrading of the vehicles. Regarding points 3 and 4, Directive 2002/49/EC states that common methods for the assessment of environmental noise should be established by the Commission and that, until such methods are adopted, Member States may use national methods provided that they are equivalent to those specified in Annex II of the directive. The Commission intends in this respect to assess shortly whether the methods currently used by Member States are equivalent to these methods. The Commission believes that the establishment of common methods should be adopted after impact assessment and taking into account the Article 11 review on the implementation of the directive.
