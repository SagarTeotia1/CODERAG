he proposes should be three years after the entry into force of the directive. However, the Environment Committee has decided that it would be more advisable to retable the amendments on this aspect adopted at first reading. Training The rapporteur considers that the Council’s proposed wording as regards staff training does not respond fully to Parliament’s concerns regarding the initial emergency measures in the event of accidents and therefore proposes an amendment on the subject. Conclusions Your rapporteur agrees with the Council and the Commission that the purpose of the proposal for a directive should be to respond to the problems linked to recent accidents and cannot constitute a comprehensive revision of the current provisions. Nevertheless, he considers that, without contradicting the original objective, the text should include the points set out above, which aim to remedy some of the shortcomings in the current legislation, which were, moreover, highlighted by the accidents which gave rise to the proposal to revise the Seveso II directive.
