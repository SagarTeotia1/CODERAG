WRITTEN QUESTION E-4031/05 by Bernat Joan i Marí (Verts/ALE) to the Council (3 November 2005) Subject: Kurdish students at Hacettepe University Hacettepe University students have been punished for collecting and signing a petition for the Kurdish language to be an optional subject on the curriculum in 2001. Ankara 11th Criminal Court for Major recently condemned two students to sentences of six years and three months' imprisonment, and another two students received sentences of three years and nine months' imprisonment just for defending education rights in their mother tongue. Tens of thousands of students signing the petition for ‘Kurdish education’ were either punished or expelled by their schools or are being prosecuted by the authorities. While the charges for students from different cities with similar court cases were dropped, students from Hacettepe University are being punished with up to six years of imprisonment. 1. Is the Council aware of these regrettable developments concerning the Kurdish language? Has the Council addressed a formal complaint to the Turkish authorities regarding these cases? 2. Owing to the fact that accession negotiations with Turkey have already begun, does the Council intend to put forward as a condition for accession the respect of the cultural and collective rights of the Kurdish People?
