confirming that they are making every possible effort to ensure prompt adoption of a Common Position and avoid any further unjustified delays; 4. Considers that the Council’s position in favour of a simple consolidation of the three existing legal bases for OLAF investigations is not a valid argument for not immediately opening negotiations on Regulation 1073/99 since simple consolidation will not improve the legal framework for OLAF anti-fraud investigations and therefore constitutes a considerable loss of time in efforts to step up the fight against fraud; opts therefore for a recasting of EU anti-fraud legislation, including EC Regulations 1073/99, 2185/96 and 2988/95, which should be based on revised Regulation (EC) No 1073/99; 5. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the competent committees of the parliaments of the Member States, the European Court of Auditors and national audit bodies of the Member States.
