WRITTEN QUESTION E-6008/08 by Frieda Brepoels (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (6 November 2008) Subject: Via Baltica The Strategic Environmental Assessment for the Via Baltica has been available since June. It contains the recommendation to route the Via Baltica via Lomza and not along route S-8 via Bialystok, which would have a damaging effect on Natura 2000 areas. Despite this recommendation, we note that work is continuing on route S-8. In the Bialystok‑Katrynka section, trees are being cut down and plans are being made for a bypass around Sztabin. This bypass would have a damaging effect on the well-known Biebrza Wetlands. The Polish Government is now thinking of renaming the S-8 section ‘Via Carpatia’ and hopes to receive funding for it from the Cohesion Fund (see Operational Programme ‘Infrastructure and Environment’). This brings the worst-case scenario of two parallel international routes (one via Lomza and one via Bialystok) dangerously close. Against this background, would the Commission please answer the following questions? 1. Is the Commission taking steps to guarantee that the recommendations of the Strategic Environmental Assessment are followed and the EU makes funding available for construction of the Lomza section? If so, what steps? If not, why not? 2. Is the Commission prepared to send Poland a clear political signal regarding cessation of work on the S-8 route? If so, what signal, and when can it be expected? 3. Does the Commission intend to initiate infringements proceedings in connection with the Sztabin bypass and the Bialystok-Katrynka section of road, as mentioned in the letter of notice of 2006?
