in active dialogue on the role and impact of EU macro-regional policies after 2013; 5. Considers that the enlargement of the European Union as well as major trans-national challenges such as the economic crisis, environmental threats, sustainable transport, energy connectivity, resource sustainability, the ecological use of water resources, show that the interdependence of individual states is on the rise, sectoral thinking is no longer appropriate and in this context the establishment of macro-regions opens up new, more efficient perspectives for cooperation by taking an integrated, coordinated approach to sustainable development on a broader regional territorial level and setting out a more efficient use of the Danube Region’s immense potential for development; 6. Underlines that its conformity with EU2020 objectives ensures that the Strategy is in line with European development trends and the EU’s commitment to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and will help raise prosperity, security and peace by providing new, additional advantages in political, economic and cultural areas; 7. Expresses its conviction that the Danube Strategy, if supported by a strong political commitment of the Member States, could represent a significant contribution to the overall success and the efficiency of the European recovery strategy after the recent years of economic and financial crisis, giving a new impetus to sustainable growth at regional, national and European level, not only within the limits of Central and Southern-Eastern Europe, but also in a much wider geographical context; 8. Notes the deep impact the global financial and economic crisis has had on all countries in the region, in particular on the Danube riparian countries; calls on all stakeholders not to weaken their commitment to the EU Strategy for the Danube Region because of the crisis; 9. Emphasizes that the Danube Strategy, together with the various forms of cross-border cooperation that it implies, could easily become a key factor of economic and environmental development, catalyzing local and regional efforts and development needs, contributing to the creation of strong cross-border interrelations in various types of industrial supply chains, municipal and regional cooperation projects and transnational transport modernization initiatives; 10. Believes that the development of large-scale strategies, such as macro- regional strategies, should contribute to enhancing the role of the local and regional level in the implementation of EU policy more generally; 11. Stresses the fact that the new ‘macro-regional’ framework of cooperation has a strong ‘top-down’ approach, and that in the framework of this model of cooperation it has to be ensured that the natural handicaps of the peripheral regions are converted into assets and opportunities, and that the development of these regions is stimulated’; 12. Recommends, in this context, increasing the local communities’ involvement by setting up wider and more focused communication and consultation tools, including through the local media (local television, radio and printed and online newspapers); suggesting a special web portal devoted to the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, which would act as a forum for the exchange of experiences regarding current and future projects undertaken by central and local governments, NGOs and other entities active in the Danube Region; 13.
