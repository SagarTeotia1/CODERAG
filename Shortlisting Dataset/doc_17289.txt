WRITTEN QUESTION E-3988/05 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (3 November 2005) Subject: Non-compliance with Directives 85/337/EEC and 92/43/EC (Habitats Directive) in relation to the grey eagle at the Castelló/Castellón airport site (Spain) The ‘agreement for the implementation of measures for the preservation of the grey eagle and protection of its habitat’ signed by the Aerocas construction company with the Land and Housing Ministry of the Valencian regional government (Comunidad Valenciana) enters into serious contradiction with the decisions made in 2001 under the environmental impact statement for the Castelló/Castellón airport with regard to the conservation of this protected species. The new agreement permits activities on the premises of the planned airport which would be totally incompatible with those listed and authorised by the environmental impact statement: the entire feeding area, far from being preserved, would be eliminated, and conservation would apply only to nests identified inside the planned airport and in its immediate environs and for the duration of the rearing period. Such phenomena as clearing, excavations, earth transfers and demolitions have been allowed, despite all being explicitly prohibited for the rearing and nesting months by the environmental impact statement and by Directive 92/43/EC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 . . This breach of the environmental impact statement and the grave impact on the grey eagle's habitat have been drawn to the attention of the Spanish Government on several occasions, but to no avail. In view of these breaches of Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 . (as amended by Directive 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5 . ) on environmental impact assessment and Directive 92/43/EC on the conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna, can the Commission state what action it will take?
