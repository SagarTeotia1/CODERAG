had very limited time to reflect on the actual proposal. Therefore, while entirely in agreement with the need to provide Georgia with exceptional MFA, your rapporteur had a difficult choice to make. Either to propose adopting the Parliament's opinion as soon as possible, in the interest of the needs of a country that has already suffered enormously. Or to defend Parliament's institutional prerogatives and refuse the unacceptable timetable for adopting a legislative proposal, thereby effectively depriving Georgia of the assistance it desperately needs and has long been looking for. Considering the above, your rapporteur suggests accepting the proposal unamended. However, your rapporteur reserves the right to propose his amendments following the consideration of the proposal in the Committee, and exchange of views with the Council and Commission. 5. Parliament's role in providing MFA The rapporteur would also like to stress, in line with previous Parliament resolutions, that such a substantial instrument as MFA cannot be simply regarded as "exceptional". It is therefore unjustifiable that such an instrument lacks a regular legal basis and continues to be based on ad hoc Council decisions for each operation. A co-decided framework regulation on MFA is necessary in order to enhance transparency, accountability, monitoring and reporting systems. In this respect it must be stressed that after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the appropriate legal basis for a Decision granting MFA will be Article 209(1) and 212(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), depending on whether the beneficiary country is classified as developing country or not by the Union institutions. In both cases, the ordinary legislative procedure applies. Article 213 TFEU should not apply to Decisions granting MFA. Moreover, the role of the Parliament should be enhanced. In particular, the Commission should improve its reporting to Parliament as concerns the actual implementation of this aid instrument and provide Parliament with an ex post evaluation report (in addition to the annual reporting foreseen in Article 5 of the proposal). 6. Commitments by the Council and the Commission Even if the proposal for MFA would be accepted by the Committee without amendments, your rapporteur requests the Council and Commission to address the above concerns in statements to Parliament.
