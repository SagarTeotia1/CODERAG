Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (19 October 2011) The Commission's ongoing EU‑wide campaign ‘Ex-smokers are unstoppable’ http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/ex_smokers_are_unstoppable/index_en.htm which aims at encouraging Europeans to stop smoking is gender sensitive and pays particular attention to targeted population groups. One of the campaign's TV clips focuses on women and presents how stopping to smoke has enabled women to fulfil her wishes and create a family. This clip was launched on 16 September 2011. The current mandatory health warnings on tobacco packs, introduced by the Tobacco Products Directive, are also intended to increase citizens' knowledge of the risks of tobacco use, to prevent smoking initiation and to encourage smokers to stop or to reduce smoking. Some of the warnings are targeted specifically at women. Finally, the Commission is currently preparing a review of the Tobacco Products Directive. The packaging and labelling of tobacco products are one of the possible areas to be raised.
