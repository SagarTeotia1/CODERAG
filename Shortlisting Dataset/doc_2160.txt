Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (30 March 2006) The duty percentage rates proposed constitute the findings of the investigation. They are based on the price undercutting found for China and Vietnam and on the traditional profits of the industry, and are thus designed specifically to address the problem. In comparing imported products with Community-produced products, adjustments with regard to quality, research and development costs, etc. have been made where appropriate. Of course, this is a provisional calculation on which all economic operators will have the opportunity to comment in accordance with the EU’s normal rules. In summary, since state intervention has taken place in the footwear sector in China and Vietnam, and this should not be allowed to distort competition, action should be taken. The recommended duties of 19.4 % for China and 16.8 % for Vietnam are what the investigation has shown to be necessary to provisionally redress the situation. It is indeed further recommended that this duty be phased in gradually over a period of six months, beginning at about 4 %. This is to ensure that retailers with goods in transit are not suddenly faced with an unexpected full tariff at the border. This takes into account the long lead time between time of order and delivery and allows predictability. It nevertheless means that, after six months, a full duty will be in place and the damaging effects of dumping will be counteracted. As regards children’s shoes, all interested parties are being consulted further on the issue of the definition of children’s footwear, with the aim of reaching an agreed definition.
