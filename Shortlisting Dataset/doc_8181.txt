associations which maintain or establish stud-books for registered equidae, OJ L 192, 11.7.1992 . for the establishment of a stud-book for Sorraia horses. In the agri-environmental measure Maintaining native breeds in the RDP for mainland Portugal (RURIS), the Portuguese authorities included provisions for the protection of the Sorraia breed. Therefore, since 2000, breeders of this endangered breed qualify for aid under the programme if they meet the terms and conditions laid down in it. Applications for eight Sorraia females were submitted in 2001 and 2002 and they are already receiving funding. In addition, a new Community programme for the conservation, characterisation, collection and utilisation of genetic resources in agriculture will soon be available, covering the period 2003-2006. The Commission proposal has almost been finalised. Once it has been adopted by the Council, interested parties (national and regional authorities, institutions and private individuals) will be able to respond to calls for proposals for measures launched by the Commission. Projects qualifying for Community part-financing will be selected by independent experts. The Commission has information on the origins and genetic heritage of the Sorraia horse which is publicly accessible in the FAO database on farm animal genetic resources (http://dad.fao.org) and on the AICS website (www.aicsorraia.fc.ul.pt), among other sources.
