WRITTEN QUESTION E-4468/06 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Council (19 October 2006) Subject: Anticorruption and good governance On 18 September 2006 the Development Committee comprised of 24 ministers of finance and development approved the World Bank's strategy paper on strengthening its engagement on governance and anticorruption. The paper entitled ‘Strengthening Bank Group Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption’ explicitly states that with respect to exceptional-risk countries, where there is a high risk of deterioration in governance or where weak governance and widespread corruption block development, government leadership has no commitment to reform, and the Bank and the government cannot agree on priorities, the new strategy will include, inter alia , a low-case scenario, which may involve highly restricted financing, a shift to non-lending activities, or a suspension in financing support. Though the purpose of the new strategy, as confirmed by President Wolfowitz, is not to disengage from areas where there are problems but rather to engage more deeply to help countries solve their problems and improve governance, concerns that this may result in the Bank's reduced lending or imposition of fresh conditions prevail. In view of the above, could the Council provide information regarding the degree to which the distribution of the EU funds is dependent on anticorruption and good governance benchmarks being met? Furthermore, could the Council elaborate on the impact of withholding funds if and when such a scenario did indeed take place, in which case were any concrete changes observed before the redistribution?
