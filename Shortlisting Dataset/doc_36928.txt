WRITTEN QUESTION E-3225/08 by Katerina Batzeli (PSE) and Maria Eleni Koppa (PSE) to the Council (9 June 2008) Subject: Reopening of Greek schools on Imbros and Tenedos The progress report for Turkey for 2007 indicates that it has failed to make any headway regarding political reform, the promotion of cultural diversity or compliance with Commission standards concerning respect for, and the protection of, minorities. The report also refers to problems still being encountered by the Greek minority in the field of education, for example, on the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, where schools have been forced to close down and their premises expropriated. This has recently prompted a visit by Council of Europe representatives to the area concerned. What steps will the EU take to resolve the problems and ensure the continued operation of schools, thereby enabling the Greek minority to conserve its linguistic, religious and cultural identity?
