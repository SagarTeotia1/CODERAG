Joint answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-5866/07 , E-6009/07 (31 January 2008) The issue of illegal spring shooting of Turtle Dove and Quail to which the Honourable Members refer is subject to an ongoing infringement procedure relating to non-compliance by Malta with the hunting provisions of Council Directive 79/409/EEC OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds. The non-compliance in question concerns an annual spring hunting season of 40 days. The problem addressed is one which presents itself on an annual basis during the months of March, April and May. At the meeting to discuss infringements on 17 October 2007, the Commission decided to send Malta a reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the EC Treaty. The Commission has opportunities to take further decisions in advance of the next spring hunting season and based on the developments of the case, will not hesitate to use all means available to it under the EC Treaty to seek compliance. The Commission is taking — and will continue to take — all appropriate measures in order to ensure that Malta, as well as all other Member States, complies with the Birds Directive. If Malta does not comply with the Birds Directive, the Commission will not hesitate to continue the infringement procedure.
