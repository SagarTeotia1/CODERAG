Question for oral answer O-000149/2011 to the Commission Rule 115 Monica Luisa Macovei , Mariya Nedelcheva , Simon Busuttil , Manfred Weber on behalf of the PPE Group Subject: Closing the gap between anticorruption law and reality On 6 June 2011 the Commission adopted an anticorruption package, which includes a communication on fighting corruption in the EU, a decision establishing an EU anticorruption reporting mechanism, a report on the implementation of Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA on combating corruption in the private sector, and a report on the modalities of EU participation in the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption (GRECO). Parliament welcomes the anticorruption package, which addresses the high costs of corruption (estimated at EUR 120 billion annually), its distorting impact on the economy, competition and the internal market, and the public’s firm expectation that the EU should take action to combat corruption (78%, Eurobarometer, December 2009). 1. As regards the Commission’s reporting mechanism, how will it verify, assess and address the effective implementation of anticorruption laws (including the application of dissuasive sanctions), which is a key concern, given that such legislation is currently non-existent or implemented unevenly? 2. Will the Commission act on the basis of Article 83(1) TFEU to adopt minimum rules on the definition of corruption and associated penalties, given the cross-border impact of corruption and its consequences for the internal market? 3. How will the Commission involve Parliament in these efforts?
