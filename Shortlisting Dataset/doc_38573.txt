Answer given by Ms Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (19 September 2008) On 20 May 2008 the Commission adopted the legislative proposals on the Health Check, aiming at adapting the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to the new market opportunities, to respond to the new challenges facing agriculture and to render the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) more efficient and simpler. In this context, it has been proposed to increase quotas by 1% annually from 2009 to 2013 with a view to their elimination in 2015. In general, it is expected that the phasing-out of milk quotas will result in an expansion of production and increase the competitiveness of the sector. At the same time, certain regions, especially but not exclusively mountainous regions, are expected to face difficulties in keeping to a minimum level of production This is precisely why a gradual phasing out of the quota system through increases rather than a sudden expiry in 2015 has been chosen in order to allow the producers to adapt to the new situation while giving a stable policy framework. There are also additional measures proposed in the Health Check which may potentially be used to support dairy producers. Article 68 of the new Direct Payments Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001, OJ L 270, 21.10.2003 . includes the possibility of granting support to address specific disadvantages affecting farmers in the sector in economically vulnerable or environmentally sensitive areas. In the broader context, Rural Development Policy is the preferred tool to tackle many of the issues mentioned by the Honourable Member. The measures of Rural Development Policy encourage increasing competitiveness in the agricultural sector, improving the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy.
