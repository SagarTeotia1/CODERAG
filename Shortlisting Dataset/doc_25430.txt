Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (9 January 2006) During the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003, the Commission has endorsed the principle of ‘nothing about people with disabilities without people with disabilities’. In its 2003 Communication on ‘Establishing equal opportunities for people with disabilities: a European Action Plan’ COM(2003)650 final. , the Commission proposed that the EU Disability High Level Group holds meetings at least once a year with representatives of people with disabilities such as the European Disability Forum, as well as with the representatives of the various stakeholders involved in the field of disability such as the Platform of European Social non‑governmental organisations (NGOs), the representatives of families of people with disabilities, the European Women's Lobby, the European Association of Service Providers and the European Platform for rehabilitation. This exchange of views between the High Level group and civil society has increased the EU ability to understand and take into consideration the varying circumstances of people with disabilities. This point is of particular importance when mainstreaming disability issues: in this respect, the Commission considers that the full and complete participation of people with disabilities into society is essentially about mobilisation of all key stakeholders across the broad range of Community policies and actions that impact, directly or indirectly, on the situation of people with disabilities. In its recent Communication COM(2005)604 final. on ‘the Situation of disabled people in the enlarged European Union: the European Action Plan 2006-07’, the Commission specified that the implementation of the disability mainstreaming strategy requires participation of people with disabilities in the decision making process and provided information on increased participation of NGOs and associations at national level. Moreover, as from 2004, the Commission has organised each year a major thematic conference for the occasion of the European Day of Disabled People in cooperation with the European Disability Forum with the purpose to promote exchange between the representatives of people with disabilities and EU policy‑makers.
