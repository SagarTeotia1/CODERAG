of their national consumer legislation to cover business-to-business transactions, and actively encourages them to do so and also to ensure cooperation between Member States' authorities as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 in order to make it possible to track down cross-border activities of this kind engaged in by business-directory companies established within the EU or in a third-country ; moreover, requests the Commission to report by December 2009 on the feasibility and possible consequences of extending the scope of Directive 2005/29/EC to cover business-to-business contracts with specific regard to point 21 of Annex I thereto; 13. Welcomes the example set by Austria, which has introduced a specific prohibition in its national legislation on misleading business directories, and calls on the Commission, in the light of the cross-border nature of this problem, to propose legislation to extend the scope of Directive 2005/29/EC, based on the Austrian model, in a way that specifically prohibits advertising in business directories unless prospective clients are unequivocally and by clear and graphic means informed that such advertisement is solely an offer for a contract against payment; 14. Notes that national legislation is often inadequate to pursue remedies against business-directory companies that are based in other Member States and therefore urges the Commission to facilitate more active cross-border cooperation among national authorities in order to enable them to provide a more effective remedy to victims; 15. Regrets that Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 is not applicable to business-to-business transactions and therefore cannot be relied upon as a means of combating misleading business directories; calls on the Commission to propose legislation to extend its application accordingly; 16. Welcomes the example of Belgium, where all those affected by misleading practices are able to take legal action in their country of residence; 17. Notes that the Austrian experience shows that the right of victims to have collective legal action taken against directory companies by trade associations or similar bodies appears to be an effective remedy which could be replicated in the initiatives currently being contemplated by the Commission's DG COMP in relation to actions for damages for breach of the EC competition rules and DG SANCO on European-level collective redress for consumers; 18. Urges Member States to ensure that victims of misleading advertising have a clearly identifiable national authority to which they can make a complaint and from which they can seek a remedy even in cases, such as these, where the victims of misleading advertising are businesses; 19. Calls on the Commission to develop best-practice guidelines for national enforcement agencies which may be followed when cases of misleading advertising are brought to their attention; 20. Calls on the Commission to pursue international cooperation with third countries and with the competent international organisations so that misleading business-directory companies based in third countries do not cause harm to businesses based in the European Union; 21. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
