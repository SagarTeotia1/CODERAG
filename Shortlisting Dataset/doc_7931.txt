Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (8 June 2007) As far as the customs classification of the product in question is concerned, it has to be classified as a spirit drink under heading 2208 of the Harmonised System (established by the World Customs Organisation) as neither the criteria of a liqueur wine under heading 2204 nor those of another fermented beverage under heading 2206, are met. The Explanatory Notes of the Harmonised System (also established by the World Customs Organisation) to heading 2208 stipulate on page IV-2208-2 under point (15) that this heading includes, inter alia , ‘Fruit or vegetable juices containing added alcohol and of an alcoholic strength by volume of more than 0,5 % vol, other than products of heading 22.04’. Heading 2204 covers only products resulting from the alcoholic fermentation of the must of fresh grapes. The expression ‘liqueur wines’ is cited in the Explanatory Notes of the Harmonised System on page IV-2204-1 under point (I) (4) and can only be used in connection with products under heading 2204. Therefore describing ‘pommeau’ as a ‘liqueur wine’ would be legally unfounded as there are no grapes involved. The text of heading 2206 stipulates that this heading comprises only fermented beverages (such as cider) and mixtures thereof. As ‘pommeau’ consists of an unfermented beverage (apple juice) mixed with a distilled product (calvados or a spirit on the basis of apple cider), classification under this heading is also excluded. The Commission understands that the Honourable Member draws a comparison to the product ‘Pineau des Charentes’. However, that product is covered by the definition of a ‘liqueur wine’, which is obtained from grape must or wine of fresh grapes. Customs classification does not follow the marketing description of a product, but its objective characteristics which are, in the case of ‘pommeau’, established by the mixture of a distilled product with an unfermented fruit juice. The excise duty liability on alcohol and alcoholic beverages is prescribed by Council Directive 92/83/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages OJ L316, 31.10.1992. and Council Directive 92/84/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages OJ L316, 31.10.1992. . Under the former the definition of alcohol and alcoholic beverages is defined by reference to the combined nomenclature in force at the date of the adoption of the directive. As ‘pommeau’ has to be classified as a spirit drink under heading 2208, it will similarly have to be treated, for excise duty purposes, as ethyl alcohol in accordance with Article 20 of the said Directive.
