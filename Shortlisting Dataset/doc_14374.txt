Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (11 February 2011) The Staff Working Document (SEC(2010)1409 of 11/11/2010) based on the results of the study on the functioning of retail electricity markets for consumers in the European Union made a number of conclusions as regards improvement of consumer conditions in retail electricity markets. The Staff Working Document has been subsequently welcomed by the Energy Council of 3 December 2010. The analysis included in the Staff Working Document should be seen in the context of the Third Energy Package whose provisions have to be implemented in 2011. With regard to the two areas mentioned in the question: 1. The European Energy Regulators (www.energy-regulators.eu) committed to develop in 2011 guidelines of good practice for price comparison and the switching process and to improve information to consumers. 2. The European Energy Regulators have already developed guidelines of good practice for complaint handling which should now be acted upon http://www.energy-regulators.eu/portal/page/portal/EER_HOME/EER_CONSULT/CLOSED%20PUBLIC%20CONSULTATIONS/CUSTOMERS/Customer%20Complaint%20Handling/CD/E10-CEM-33-05_GGP-ComplaintHandling_10-Jun-2010.pdf . In addition, the Commission will set up a multi-stakeholder working group to promote best practice in alternative dispute resolution in energy.
