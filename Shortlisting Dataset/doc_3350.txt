Question for written answer E-000360/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Spyros Danellis (S&D) (20 January 2012) Subject: Livestock exports to Turkey According to Eurostat data, during the last 12 months, more than one million sheep and cattle were exported from the EU to Turkey. According to reports by reputable animal rights organisations, conditions of livestock transport frequently infringe Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport. On many occasions, the space provided for livestock transport, specifically clearance between animal heads and the ceiling, is insufficient, while ventilation and water supply systems are defective. These problems are compounded by delays at the Turkish border, often lasting hours — or even days — due to omissions in the requisite accompanying documentation or non-compliance with strict Turkish livestock regulations. During such delays, the livestock is generally left hungry and thirsty on the transport vehicles where it is also exposed to particularly high temperatures during the summer. The animals do not always survive the ordeal. In view of this: 1. What action is being taken by the Commission to ensure that livestock exports to Turkey comply with Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005? 2. Does the Commission intend to organise meetings between Turkey and the Member States involved in a bid to find practical ways of resolving problems regarding the well-being of exported livestock during transport?
