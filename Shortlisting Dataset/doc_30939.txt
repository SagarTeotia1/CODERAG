WRITTEN QUESTION E-2249/09 by Marian Harkin (ALDE) to the Commission (2 April 2009) Subject: VAT In the case of companies which are only letterbox companies: (a) charging VAT to their customers in the EU, (b) not supplying any regulatory VAT numbers, (c) not filing VAT returns and (d) not remitting the money to the EU Member State concerned, does the Commission have any measures to tackle these situations where companies outside the EU issue VAT invoices purporting to have been issued inside the EU when in fact they are merely a letterbox company? Could the Commission please provide details on what aspect of EC law would cover this?
