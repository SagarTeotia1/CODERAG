Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (13 November 2008) This written question follows up several written questions by Mr Meyer Pleite ( E‑0109/06 , E‑2057/06 and E‑3057/06 ) http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB . The Commission confirms that the four agglomerations of Benicarló, Vinarós, Peñíscola and Alcalá de Xivert-Alcossebre are included in an horizontal infringement procedure launched by the Commission against the Spanish Kingdom for bad implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC OJ L 135, 30.5.1991. concerning urban waste water treatment in agglomerations of more than 15 000 population-equivalent located in non-sensitive areas. This procedure is currently in the Article 226-phase. Therefore the imposition of penalties is not envisaged at this point of time. The Commission will keep the Honourable Member informed of the next developments of the infringement procedure.
