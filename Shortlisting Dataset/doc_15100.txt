Question for written answer E-011009/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 María Muñiz De Urquiza (S&D) , Teresa Riera Madurell (S&D) and Raimon Obiols (S&D) (25 November 2011) Subject: VP/HR — Demolition of a photovoltaic plant in Emnaizel in the West Bank by the Israeli army Within the framework of bilateral development cooperation, the Spanish Government, via its Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), provided EUR 292 000 in funding for the construction of a photovoltaic plant in Emnaizel, a small village situated in ‘Area C’ of the West Bank, i.e. under the exclusive control of the Israeli authorities. Constructed in 2009, this plant provides electricity for the 300 inhabitants of Emnaizel, a school and a medical centre. On 11 October 2011, the Israeli military and representatives of the so-called ‘Civil Authority’ announced that it would be demolished because it had not have the mandatory building permit. The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits attacks on, or damage to, any infrastructure that is necessary for the survival of the civilian population, and obliges the occupying authorities to ensure the general protection of civilian collective goods. 1. Is the Vice-President/High Representative aware of this situation? If so, what action is being taken to protect the rights of the Palestinian population and EU investment under its development cooperation policy, and to oblige Israel to comply with international law and, more specifically, international humanitarian law? 2. We request that the EU‑Israel Association Council be convened so that the Israeli authorities can be asked to explain the repeated destruction of civilian infrastructure built by the EU or its Member States.
