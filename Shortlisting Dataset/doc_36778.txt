Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (29 June 2010) The current restrictions on the carriage of liquids in airports have been put in place for security reasons, to the benefit of all travellers. The effects of such measures is that only limited quantities of liquids can pass the security checks. Once past the security checks, bottles can be purchased in the shops and dispensers available. The prices of goods can be set freely under European law. This principle equally applies to the sales of goods by shops beyond security checks in airports. Prices depend on a number of factors, including the costs that shops in an airport have to bear, the degree of competition between shops, the elasticity of demand, etc. The antitrust rules of the European Union prevent agreements between competitors which have as their object or effect to restrict competition. They also prohibit abuses of dominant position in a substantial part of the internal market. Both prohibitions only apply to the extent that the conduct may have a significant effect on trade between Member States The indications given by the Honourable Member do not point to an infringement of these rules. There are notably no indications that duty-free shops would have agreed to illegally set the price of bottles or that the prices of bottles would be abusively excessive in a substantial part of the internal market. The Commission is not considering imposing an obligation to introduce free water dispensers in duty-free areas.
