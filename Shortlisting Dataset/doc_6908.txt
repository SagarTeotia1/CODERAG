Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (23 July 2008) Directive 2005/89/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment OJ L 33, 4.2.2006. stipulates provisions to ensure security of electricity supply. Transposition deadline of this directive into national legislation was February 2008, therefore its provisions are fully applicable in Member States. Article 4(1) of the directive indicates that Transmission System Operators are responsible for electricity network security rules, as well as for the daily management of the electricity grid and control of possible cuts/outages. Cooperation and information exchange between the electricity networks operators is also crucial as it helps to prevent possible blackouts. In this regard, the Third Energy Package COM(2007)528 final; COM(2007)529 final; COM(2007)530 final; COM(2007)531 final; COM(2007)532 final. proposed by the Commission envisage better cooperation between networks operators via European Network of Transmission System Operators. If electricity supply is interrupted, disputes between consumer and supplier should be solved within the scope of their contract. Contractual obligations of suppliers towards their custumers are left to subsidiarity and therefore not covered by the EU legislation. Nonetheless, a basic list of consumer protection measures is contained in Annex A of Directive 2003/54/EC OJ L 176, 15.7.2003. of Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC.
