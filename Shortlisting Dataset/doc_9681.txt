Reply (19 January 2011) It is the responsibility of the competent authorities in the Member States to examine applications for international protection, in accordance with Council Directives 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third‑country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted OJ L 304, 30.9.2004, p. 12. , and 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status OJ L 326, 13.12.2005, p. 13. . Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on common standards and procedures for returning illegally staying third-country nationals OJ L 348, 24.12.2008, p. 98. must be transposed by Member States by December 2010. Under Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union, it is up to the Commission to ensure the application of the Treaties and of the measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them, as well as to oversee the application of Union law under the control of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Council has not been informed of the measures mentioned by the Honourable Member and is therefore not in a position to comment on them.
