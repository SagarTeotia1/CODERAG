Question for written answer E-6127/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (27 July 2010) Subject: Monitoring centre for Islamic radicalism The integration of Muslims is currently posing new challenges for European societies and, especially after the events of September 2001, the issue of the presence and penetration of Islamic fundamentalism in Europe has assumed considerable importance with regard to both the security of European citizens and respect for fundamental human rights. Indeed, not only does Islamic fundamentalism threaten the safety of European citizens and the integrity of Western institutions, but it also concerns the Islamic community in Europe. Phenomena that were thought to belong to social and cultural worlds light years away from Europe (such as crimes of honour, the imposition of certain types of clothing on religious grounds, forced marriages, religious violence, not to mention the tragic bombings of Madrid and London) are present and growing in Europe as well. Given the growing importance of the issue of Islamic radicalism in Europe and since one of the EU's objectives is to help establish an area of internal security in which the fundamental right of freedom is safeguarded, what measures has the Council taken to help, alongside the Member States, counter the penetration and spread of Islamic radicalism in Europe? Will the Council set up (or call for the establishment of) a special body to monitor the situation of Islamic radicalism in Europe, in terms of its developments, trends, phenomenology and the degree of danger it poses?
