Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2011) 1. The choice of network or individualised management of the public airports in Spain is a matter for the Member State concerned. State aid rules do not prevent a Member State from setting up a single company to operate the different airports. 2 and 3. The application of a common system of rates in the Spanish airport network is within the competencies of the Member State. Under Article 4 of Directive 2009/12/EC OJ L 70, 14.3.2009 . on airport charges (to be transposed into national law by March 2011) Member States are entitled to establish a charging scheme covering a network of airports under the operation of a single managing body as is the case in Spain. Member States are under no obligation to justify such a network. Drawing on well-established policies of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the same Directive obliges Member States to ensure minimum standards of transparency, non-discrimination and user-consultation in the calculation and levying of airport charges, whether they are applied at a single airport or across a network. AENA, to the extent it performs economic activities, is subject to the antitrust rules of the European Union. Excessive airport charges could constitute a breach of Article 102 of the Treaty, in respect of abuses of dominant position. The information contained in the question does not, however, allow one to conclude that AENA's charges are excessive within the meaning of that provision. Indeed, the indication in the question that AENA is loss making does not appear to be, at first sight, an indication of excessive charges.
