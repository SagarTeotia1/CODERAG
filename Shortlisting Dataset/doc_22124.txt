ORAL QUESTION H-0165/10/rev.1 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Charalampos Angourakis to the Commission Subject: Strike-breaking measures against Egyptian fishermen Striking Egyptian fishermen in the region of Michaniona have been subjected to attacks on their lives and physical integrity by thugs hired by their employers, while their right to strike is being flagrantly violated. In particular, during the strike, the Greek Manpower Employment Organisation (OAED) accepted false declarations submitted by the employers of 'voluntary departures' by strikers, without the approval of the fishermen concerned, thereby allowing large numbers of unemployed fishermen to be hired despite the fact that Law 1264/82 prohibits recruitment during a strike. Moreover, a ruling on the complaint filed by the Egyptian fishermen’s trade union has been postponed until 14 April, thus giving the shipowners free rein to continue hiring strike-breakers. Does the Commission condemn these attacks on immigrant workers by their employers, and the transformation of the OAED into a strike-breaking mechanism?
