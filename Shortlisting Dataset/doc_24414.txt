Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (20 March 2007) A central register of such contributions does not exist, since consultations are carried out in a decentralised manner. The research required to provide a detailed answer to the Honourable Member's question would be out of all proportion to the result obtained and would be inappropriate in the context of answering a written question. However, general information on the Commission's consultation processes is available on the Internet, in particular on the Commission's single access point for consultation ‘Your Voice in Europe’ http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/consultations/index_en.htm. . The web portal provides comprehensive information on open public consultations, the related consultation documents and questionnaires, and their follow-up, such as consultation reports and published contributions.
