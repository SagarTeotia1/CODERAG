WRITTEN QUESTION E-3248/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (11 June 2008) Subject: A second language requirement for airport officials in EU Member States While travelling to Brussels or Strasbourg, I and many other MEPs sometimes have to pass through the CDG airport in Paris. In addition to the many problems encountered because of that particular airport's ‘passenger unfriendliness’, we also find it difficult to communicate with airport officials, e.g. customs officers, as most of them do not speak English or any other language other than French! Does the Commission agree with me that, in the interest of better communication between EU Member States' citizens and in order to help travellers at an international airport in the EU, French authorities must try to make sure that customs officers and other officials working there should, in addition to their mother language, be able to speak another EU language (preferably one of the main EU languages)? I know that the Commission or any other EU organ cannot force the French or any other national authorities to implement a second language requirement for their officials, but perhaps the Commission can find a way of advising Member States as to the wisdom of so doing, in order to help EU citizens and at the same time promote better relations amongst different EU Member States. Does the Commission have a comment in relation to this?
