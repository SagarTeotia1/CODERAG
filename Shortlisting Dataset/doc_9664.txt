WRITTEN QUESTION P-0517/10 by Morten Løkkegaard (ALDE) to the Commission (2 February 2010) Subject: Digital Strategy in Europe Will the Commission leave it to the Member States to make their own solutions regarding the choice of technology or will the Commission actively encourage wireless broadband and fibre networks, by subsidising Member States choosing these options? Is it fair to conclude that the Commission is reluctant to let the market decide which solution is the best for Internet coverage? President Barroso has actively promoted the extension of wireless broadband and fibre networks. Has the Commission considered that new technologies will appear in the coming years and that they need to be considered as well?
