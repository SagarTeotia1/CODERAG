EMPL Working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities (Bauer - EPP) EMPL Committee rejected the Commission's proposal by 30-19-0. The Commission's proposal for a directive amending Directive 2002/15/EC does not cover genuine self-employed drivers, but as of 23 March 2009 the Directive 2002/15/EC was foreseen to include the self-employed drivers, unless it was decided before that date to exclude the latter category from the scope of the Directive. The current proposal maintains the definition of "working time" applicable to all drivers covered by the directive, but deletes the definition of "working time" for self-employed drivers as they fall outside its scope. The draft report supported the approach of the European Commission and focused on fighting against the phenomenon of "false self-employed"- giving a precise definition of what an independent driver should be, rather than regulating the working time of the self-employed - was overturned in Committee. Consequently, as with its vote of 2 March 2009 during the previous legislature, the EMPL Committee supports the full inclusion of self-employed drivers within the scope of the Directive. 20100503CAN73959
