Question for written answer E-001244/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) (17 February 2011) Subject: International Agreement on the protection of the Prespa Park According to the announcement by the Society for the Protection of Prespa, a year has passed since the signature of the International Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development on the Prespa Park between the European Union (represented by the then Commissioner for the Environment), Albania, FYROM and Greece without any substantial progress being made as regards its ratification. The signature of the 2010 agreement marked the official commitment of the three states and the EU’s active involvement of the EU in this cooperation, ten years after the creation of Prespa Park as the first cross-border protected region in the Balkans. I would like to ask the Commission: 1. What are the reasons for the delay in the ratification of the agreement? 2. Is it possible to give me details of the timescale for the procedures that it followed up to submission of the agreement to the European Parliament and Council? 3. Does it intend to put pressure on the contracting parties to expedite the process of ratification of the agreement? 4. Does it sympathise with the unease of the representatives of local organisations in the region that there is a distinct risk of failure to implement the content of the agreement?
