Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (19 February 2008) According to the official information submitted by the Spanish authorities, the Particulate Matter (PM 10 ) limit values for the protection of human health were not exceeded in 2005 and 2006 in the city of Valencia. That information is, however, based on the monitoring from only two monitoring stations in the L'Horta air quality zone, in which the city resides. According to Annex VII of Directive 1999/30/EC Council Directive 1999/30/EC of 22 April 1999 relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air, OJ L 163, 29.6.1999. , the required number of monitoring stations for a zone of this size is four, when no supplementary assessment Supplementary assessment may include indicative measurements or air quality modelling. is performed. The Commission has contacted the Spanish authorities and received confirmation that though the monitoring of PM 10 is performed at four additional monitoring stations in the zone, these stations do not comply with the PM 10 monitoring method requirements set in Annex IX of Directive 1999/30/EC. The Commission has already requested the Spanish authorities to immediately ensure full respect of the assessment requirements as specified in Annexes VI-IX of Directive 1999/30/EC. It will monitor progress and consider taking further steps including infringement as necessary. As regards Fine Particulate Matter (PM 2.5 ), there is no miminum number of monitoring stations prescribed in Directive 1999/30/EC. More detailed PM 2.5 requirements are set out in the proposal for a new air quality directive for which an agreement following the second reading has recently been reached COD(2005)0183 http://europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier.cfm?CL=en&ReqId=0&DocType=COM&DocYear=2005&DocNum=0447http://europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier.cfm?CL=en&ReqId=0&DocType=COM&DocYear=2005&DocNum=0447 . The new directive is expected to enter into force in the first half of 2008. As stated by the Honourable Member, Article 8 of Directive 1999/30/EC requires information to be given to the public on ambient air quality including up-to-date information on ambient concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead. Such public information must indicate at least any exceedance of limit values and alert thresholds, and it shall also provide short assessments of effects on health. The dissemination of this information is left to the discretion of the Member States. As an example, this may include broadcast media, press and computer-network services (i.e. Internet). In Valencia, the information on the concentration of air pollutants is available through the Internet http://www.cth.gva.es/cidam/emedio/atmosfera . The Commission notes that the data currently made available online includes up-to-date information on monitored air pollutants, annual evaluations, information on pollutants themselves (including their health effects), as well as monitoring sites. In addition, an air quality index is compiled and regularly updated to provide aggregated information on air quality.
