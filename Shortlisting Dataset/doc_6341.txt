WRITTEN QUESTION E-2198/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (31 March 2009) Subject: Legalisation of state hacking It has recently emerged that the European Union has authorised national police forces to carry out remote searches on the PCs of European citizens. In other words, European postal police will no longer need a search warrant signed by a judge. They will be able to monitor people's computers independently and anonymously, entering them without our knowledge. This will cause major problems: whoever has a password-protected PC, for example, might see his or her computer infected by a ‘trojan’ virus because of a police search. Accordingly, in addition to the already familiar privacy issues, we will also have a PC security issue to address. It is likely, in fact, that once a PC has been searched, its operating system will be irreparably damaged. While constant monitoring of the Internet through searches on multimedia devices (subject to prior authorisation by judicial bodies) is undoubtedly important, how does the Commission consider such an invasive measure to be compatible with Community law? Does it not consider that monitoring which is totally at the police's discretion could result in an abuse of power and of the law, not to mention a breach of privacy? How does the Commission intend to act?
