Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2012) 1. As the Honourable Member pointed out, the new Dutch law has not yet been adopted and is currently subject to parliamentary debate. Therefore the Commission is at this stage not in the position to carry out a thorough analysis of this law and to express an opinion as to its compatibility with EC law, in particular Directive 2001/29/EC. 2. According to this directive Member States may introduce an exception for acts of private copying provided that the rightholders receive fair compensation. However, the directive leaves member states free to decide how to implement this obligation. In this respect, the abolition of the compensation for private copying could contravene Directive 2001/29/EC if no alternative system is established to ensure that the rightholders receive fair compensation. 3. The Commission analyses the national law of Member States in the light of the acquis , notably Directive 2001/29/EC as interpreted by the CJEU. The Commission will not refrain from addressing the issue with the Dutch authorities should, in its view, there be a doubt as to whether the new provisions are compatible with EC law. 4. Member States implementing the exception for acts of private copying (all EU member states but the UK and Ireland) provide for fair compensation in the form of a levy system except for Malta and Luxembourg. As announced in the Commission's Communication of 24 May 2011, the Commission appointed Mr António Vitorino, former European Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, to take up the mission of mediator to lead the process of the stakeholder dialogue on private copying levies. The process has as its objective laying the ground for legislative action on private copying levies at EU level. These plans are not affected by the proposed changes to the Dutch system.
