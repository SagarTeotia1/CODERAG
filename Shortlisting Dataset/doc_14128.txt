Question for written answer E-6916/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Herbert Reul (PPE) (6 September 2010) Subject: Swiss economic success and conclusions for the shaping of the European Innovation Union As regards the current preparations for the planned European Innovation Union, would the Commission state whether it has sufficiently analysed the considerable achievements in innovation of the Swiss economy in order to gain insights which could be useful for the shaping of the EU research economy? According to the Commission’s 2009 European Innovation Scoreboard, Switzerland is by far Europe’s most innovative economy, whereas the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2009‑10 rates Switzerland as the most competitive economy in the world. The OECD Factbook 2009 lists Switzerland as the country with the highest number of patents per inhabitant in the world, and the Commission’s Science, Technology and Competitiveness Key Figures Report 2008/2009 rates Switzerland as one of the leading economies in Europe as regards the number of patents per inhabitant and the level of private research investment in relation to GDP. These achievements in the field of private research and innovation are all the more surprising when one considers that: — it has always been a fundamental principle of Swiss research policy that private research should not be supported with public funds; — public funding for research — 0.67 % of GDP — is relatively low compared to other high-innovation countries such as Finland or Sweden; — public funding for research focuses on excellent funding for fundamental research, with generous budgets for a small number of educational and research institutions such as the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology in Zurich; — most Swiss research funding is allocated in accordance with the bottom-up approach, i.e. there are no thematic requirements; — wage levels are extremely high owing to the financial sector, which has driven wage costs up, thus reducing Switzerland's attractiveness as a business location. Private research investment levels in the Netherlands, however, have fallen in the last 10 years, despite tax incentives and innovation vouchers. Has the Commission analysed Switzerland’s remarkable success, and what conclusions has it arrived at following this analysis as regards the shaping of the European Innovation Union and the Eighth Framework Programme?
