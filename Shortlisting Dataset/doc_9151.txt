Question for written answer E-008573/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Francisco Sosa Wagner (NI) (28 September 2011) Subject: State aid for financial bodies Spain has presented a report to the Commission on the granting of public guarantees to financial bodies in order to obtain the relevant extensions of authorisation for such state aid. In these critical economic times, the aforementioned guarantees significantly increase what are already inordinate levels of public debt. Indeed, Spain has exceeded the limits laid down in EU regulations given that forecasts for 2011 place public debt at 65 %. One must not forget last week's announcement by the European Central Bank on coordinated action with the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank to provide dollar liquidity to European banks. Given that state aid compounds non-compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and heightens the economic risks to the eurozone, does the Commission believe that this state aid should continue? Would it not be preferable to assess how the measures taken by the banking authorities affect the financial situation before extending aid that has such adverse effects, in increasing the size of a Member State's public debt and distorting competition in the financial markets?
