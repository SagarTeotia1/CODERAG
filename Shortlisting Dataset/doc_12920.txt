Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (20 November 2007) The Akamas Peninsula is a rich site for biodiversity and fulfils the criteria for classification as a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Birds Directive Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. and the criteria for its inclusion in the national list of proposed Sites of Community importance (pSCI) under the Habitats Directive Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . As Cyprus has not classified the most suitable territories as SPA's, in number and size, for the protection of those species mentioned in Annex I to Directive 79/409/EEC and of the other migratory species which regularly occur in Cyprus, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure in June 2007. The Akamas peninsula is one of the sites concerned. In addition, during the Mediterranean biogeographical seminar, which took place in December 2006, it was concluded that the Cypriot list of pSCI was insufficient; most of the insufficiencies observed were related to the failure to include the entire Akamas Peninsula in the list of pSCI. Cyprus is now expected to present additional sites. The directives for nature protection do not lay down rules regarding the consultation process to be followed in selecting the sites. This is for the Member States to determine. Consequently, the Commission cannot intervene and propose a compromise solution regarding the disagreement between the Cypriot authorities and the local communities. However, it should be recalled that the selection of Natura 2000 sites is based exclusively on scientific criteria, such as the size and density of populations of target species and the ecological quality and area of target habitat types present in the site. Other considerations, particularly those of an economic or social nature, may play no role in the classification of the area. This has also been confirmed by the European Court of Justice For instance, Case C‑355/90, Commission v Spain (‘Santoña Marshes’) [1993] ECR I‑4221, or Case C‑371/98, First Corporate Shipping , [2000] ECR I‑9235. .
