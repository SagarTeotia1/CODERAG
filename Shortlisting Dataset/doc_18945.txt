Question for written answer E-001355/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marietta Giannakou (PPE) (18 February 2011) Subject: Institutional role of Member States' central banks and the economic crisis Owing to the financial crisis, central banks have increased their oversight role, and long-term loans have been ‘decoupled’ from short-long loans. Given the measures that central banks have been obliged to take, in particular implementation of the policy of ‘quantitative easing’, will the Commission say: 1. Does it consider that the central banks of Member States are forced by circumstances to play a more important oversight role in markets and therefore to acquire a greater ‘political’ role, thereby challenging one element of the pre-2007 consensus, namely that central banks should be as far removed as possible from politics, since part of the attractiveness of the principle of ‘one tool, one target’ was that it made monetary policy a technical, not a political issue? 2. Does it consider that the institutional role of central banks has been affected or even transformed as a result of, and in the wake of, the economic crisis?
