to these least developed countries to adapt to the effects of climate change and develop sustainably their economies; 6. Considers that a legally binding global emissions ceiling should be agreed in distributing the total amount of available emission rights; in the long term the principle of equal rights per world citizen must be applied; 7. Reiterates its view that flexible mechanisms should be supplementary to policies and measures (domestic action) and must account for no more than 50% of the difference between the 1990 emissions level and the Kyoto target; strongly urges the Parties to adopt a binding agreement on this issue and to make sure that the method of allocation of emissions permits must be based on the principles of equity, environmental effectiveness and transparency and be guided by the ‘polluter pays’ principle; 8. Calls on the Parties to create a framework for the quick application of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which establishes a positive list of projects and technologies that are eligible under this mechanism; notes that projects eligible should be based on sustainability, energy efficiency and demand-side management in the fields of energy and transport and should exclude nuclear and large-scale fossil-fuel energy sources; 9. Considers that it is necessary to be very cautious about including greenhouse gas sinks among ways of complying with reduction obligations, as further research is needed in order to clarify the possible scale and impact of this measure and the risks associated with it, and that the use of carbon sinks should be strongly restricted until such information is available and a monitoring system has been established; notes further that the use of such carbon sinks must be linked to recognised sustainable forest management schemes; 10. Calls for the establishment of a strong compliance mechanism linked to an economic penalty system for non-compliance and a compliance fund to be used to minimise the effects of non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol; Ratification 11. calls on all Parties to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the basis of the above objectives in time for the Rio+10 conference in 2002; 12. Stresses that the Kyoto Protocol can only realise its full potential as a major step towards combating the greenhouse effect if it is ratified; 13. Appeals to Members of the US Senate and House of Representatives to drop their resistance to the principles agreed in Kyoto and to do justice to their responsibility to combat the greenhouse effect; urges European Union negotiators nonetheless to map out, in the run-up to the Hague Conference, ways whereby the quickest possible ratification of the Protocol could be achieved without the USA; proposes to that end that an agreement be reached with other industrialised countries, including Japan, the Central and East European countries and in particular Russia, that will guarantee ratification of the Kyoto Protocol; requests the negotiators not to relinquish any EU position vis-à-vis the USA if it has not been guaranteed that Congress will ratify the Kyoto Protocol; 14. Reiterates its view, given the possible outcome of COP-6, that it is now increasingly likely that ratification of the
