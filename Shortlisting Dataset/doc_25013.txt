WRITTEN QUESTION P-0172/08 by Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM) to the Commission (16 January 2008) Subject: European emergency call number ‘112’ In the 2000 Eurobarometer survey on knowledge of the 112, the question was ‘Imagine you are on a trip to another country of the European Union and you have an emergency (an accident, you are attacked, a fire). Which telephone number would you call for help?’ In the 2006 and 2007 Eurobarometer Surveys, instead of a single straightforward question identical to the above, two questions were asked as follows: QB37. ‘Can you tell me the number of emergency services, for example in case someone would urgently need medical assistance? (Answer: 112 in national context)’ and QB38. ‘Can you tell me what single telephone number enables you to call emergency services anywhere in the European Union, from a fixed or a mobile phone? (Answer: 112)’. However, 1. 112 is already used as one of the national emergency numbers in several EU countries such as Italy, Estonia, Slovenia, Germany, Portugal or as the single national number in others, for example Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Spain; 2. 112 is known to be the emergency call number to use with a mobile phone. Does the Commission consider the results of the 2006 and 2007 surveys unbiased and comparable with the ones of the 2000 survey? How is the Commission planning to avoid ‘guiding the responder’ and evaluate the real knowledge about the existence and use of the 112 as provided for in Article 26.4 of the Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC and requested in Written Declaration 0044/2007 of the European Parliament?
