Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (16 August 2011) European customs legislation does not lay down any specific conditions or criteria relating to imports of coffins from China. In the European Union tariff, such goods are classified according to their constituent material. As this is not specified, it is difficult to answer the question. However, by way of example, I can inform you that customs duties on products of wood from China range from 0 % to 4 % ad valorem . The EU import phytosanitary legislation may apply to products of wood as they may harbour live pests. In that case, specific requirements could apply depending on the nature of the items. As the applicable legislation is very technical, additional information will be forwarded separately to the Honourable Member. Finally, the Commission, should like to draw the Member's attention to the Export Helpdesk, a free online service provided by the European Commission to facilitate market access to the European Union. It can be accessed at the following web address: http://exporthelp.europa.eu This website provides detailed information concerning conditions applicable to import into the EU on a product based approach. With regard to the goods you refer to, namely coffins imported from China, searches based on selecting the product of interest will provide information concerning the conditions and quality standards is available in the section ‘Requirements and Taxes’ while information about customs duties can be found in the section ‘Import Tariff’.
