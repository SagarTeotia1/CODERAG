WRITTEN QUESTION P-4725/08 by Dirk Sterckx (ALDE) to the Commission (2 September 2008) Subject: Problems with the application of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 to market traders Article 13 of Regulation No 561/2006 OJ L 102, 11.4.2006, p. 1. permits Member States to grant a number of exemptions from the obligations concerning tachographs and driving and rest times for particular kinds of transport and categories of occupation, such as the transport of circus and funfair equipment, the carriage of live animals to and from markets, etc. These are types of transport which, by their very nature, are unable to be subjected to the provisions of the regulation. However, the regulation provides no exemption for market traders. As a result, market traders with a lorry weighing more than 7.5 tonnes are covered by the provisions of the regulation and are thus restricted in the exercise of their occupation. Is the Commission aware of this problem? Would it not be desirable to amend Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 to that effect, or does the regulation as it stands offer some other way of exempting market traders?
