Is concerned about the widespread phenomenon of violence in the workplace, ranging from harassment and unwelcome intimate approaches to serious physical violence; 67. Notes that there are still 15.5 million unemployed persons in the EU in 1999, accounting for 9% of the working population, and approximately 40 million people living under the poverty line, and that poverty and the resulting exclusion are unworthy of a democratic and developed society; calls for recognition of the right of the poorest sections of the population to assist and form associations with one another; considers that those who take part in voluntary work through an association should not be penalised financially, as happens in certain Member States where militancy through membership of associations is subject to authorisation or is penalised; 68. Calls, therefore, for the right to a decent standard of living (i.e. to adequate social protection - and hence safeguards against serious financial poverty - housing, adequate health care and proper education) to be explicitly included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights; 69.

Considers that the next Commission reports on progress by the applicant countries with regard to human rights ought to devote greater and more systematic attention to : - the rights of women, as there are many indications that in the absence of an adequate compensatory policy the current reforms are disproportionately placing women at a disadvantage; - the lack, in many applicant countries,
