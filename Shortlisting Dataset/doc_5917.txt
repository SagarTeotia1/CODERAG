Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (1 December 2005) The Commission regrets that the Honourable Member has not yet received a reply to his e‑mail sent on 27 September 2005 referring to the press summary report made by the EC delegation in Skopje. The Commission would like to assure the Honourable Member that it uses the provisional denomination ‘the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’, under which that State has been admitted to membership of the United Nations, whenever referring to that country in any official document. The document the Honourable Member is referring to is a short summary of the news, as published in the local media, compiled by the EC delegation. While it is mainly for the internal use of the Commission, it is shared with Members of the Parliament for the sake of good inter-institutional cooperation. The Commission will also make sure that, in this kind of paper in the future, the provisional denomination will be used.
