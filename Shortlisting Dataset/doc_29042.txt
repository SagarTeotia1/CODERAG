Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2009) As the Honourable Member will be aware, the European eel stock is in a very bad state. As a result the Council adopted in 2009 Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 OJ L 70, 14.3.2008. to save this stock. It allows Member States to choose between various measures to help the eel stock recover. One of the possible measures is indeed limiting (closing) the fishery on eel, and Ireland chose this measure in its national Management Plan on eels as the way forward to help the eel stock to recover. The Irish authorities have recently sent their plan to the services of the Commission. The Commission is now in the process of assessing the Irish management plan and as also the management plans which have been sent by other Member States. Before deciding whether to approve the plan, the Commission will also take into account the technical assessment by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).
