for payment appropriations are foreseen. For the Cohesion Fund EUR 7 122 million for commitments and EUR 4 947 million for payment appropriations are planned. There will be essentially no margin available within sub-heading 1 b due to a clear spending target. 33. For the period 2007-2013 the overall envelope for the Funds will be split between three objectives: · convergence: this objective covers regions whose GDP per capita is below 75% of the EU average · regional competitiveness and employment: this objective covers all those Objective 1 regions lying outside the Convergence objective. · territorial co-operation: this objective aims at funding cross-border and trans-national cooperation on a range of actions linked to the Lisbon and Gothenburg agenda (including networks of exchange, analyses and studies between regions and local authorities). 34. The Commission highlights that the proposed division of commitment appropriations between the two funds presented for 2007 is provisional as it is the result of an extrapolation on historical data of the present programming period. It will be reviewed in the light of the results of the negotiations with the Member States on their new National Strategic Reference Framework and Operational Programmes for the period 2007-2013. Structural Funds 35. A direct comparison between the Structural Funds in 2006 and 2007 is not straightforward due to the changes in the financial framework: The Structural Funds now only comprise the ERDF and the ESF, whereas in 2006 the EAGGF guidance and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance were also included (the latter now form part of heading 2). Cohesion Fund 36. The increase of the total commitments for the Cohesion Fund (18%) is fully accounted for by an increase in commitments for the new Member States and the allocation for Bulgaria and Romania. For EU-15 the Cohesion Fund allocation has even fallen by 24%. The new Member States together with Bulgaria and Romania now account for some 70% of the Cohesion Fund. Priorities for 2007 37. As for the priorities for 2007, the Commission points out that the overall priorities for funding by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are set out in the draft Structural Fund regulations and the Community Strategic Guidelines, which govern which types of intervention are considered eligible for Community funding. However, the precise allocation of funding to different priorities and projects will depend on the actual programming that is undertaken by Member States during the course of 2006 and 2007. Therefore, the Commission is of the view that the principal priority for 2007 will be to ensure adoption and agreement of programmes for the period, building upon the Community Guidelines and the National Strategic Reference framework that Member States will agree with the Commission for the period 2007-2013. Apart from this, the preparation of the closure of 2000-2006 programmes will be a main objective. DG Regional Policy will continue the implementation of 2000-2006 European Regional Development programmes (around 380 programmes and 215 major projects) and Cohesion Fund projects. The payment of these programmes will last until the end of 2008, and the related reporting until 2010. Heading
