Reply (22 December 2006) As the Honourable Members know, on 17 October 2006 the Council welcomed the Commission's monitoring report on the state of preparedness for EU membership of Bulgaria and Romania, which concludes that Bulgaria and Romania, on the basis of progress made, will be in a position to take on the rights and obligations of membership on 1 January 2007. The Council noted the advanced state of the ongoing process of ratification of the Accession Treaty and looked forward to welcoming Bulgaria and Romania to the Union on 1 January 2007. Regarding the need to create a competitive structure which supports SMEs, fights corruption and provides legal certainty, the Commission noted in its Monitoring Report of May 2006 that Bulgaria and Romania are functioning market economies and that the implementation of current reforms should enable them to meet the economic criteria and the acquis in full. The implementation of the acquis and the ongoing judicial reform are improving the business environment. Despite this, in its monitoring report of September 2006, the European Commission identified a number of areas of continuing concern, and areas where the Commission will initiate appropriate measures to ensure the proper functioning of EU policies, unless Bulgaria and Romania take immediate corrective action. The Council, which supports the Commission's approach, will continue monitoring the situation in both countries. Furthermore, upon accession Bulgaria and Romania should also benefit from increased EU funding, including Structural Funds, to support and improve the competitiveness of their SMEs.
