WRITTEN QUESTION E-1431/10 by Damien Abad (PPE) to the Commission (11 March 2010) Subject: Access to insurance by small, medium and craft enterprises in the building sector to stimulate innovation and the promotion of eco-technologies in the European Union Everyone agrees that the building industry and, in particular, SMEs, including micro-enterprises and craft enterprises, play a leading role in promoting energy savings and the development of renewable energies. However, uptake of the new technologies is being restricted by the difficulties encountered by very small firms — and SMEs in general — in obtaining insurance, as the insurance companies refuse to guarantee the new technologies in question. The European Parliament became involved in this issue by voting for a budget line proposed by the Committee on Budgets to encourage the deployment of a Community financial instrument. This instrument would provide insurance companies with a guarantee so as to reduce the risks involved, thus enabling small and craft firms to offer, at no additional cost, the requisite guarantees relating to products in the eco-technology sector in line with national practice. The Commission, meanwhile, has commissioned a consortium to produce a study on building insurance schemes in Europe. The European Liability Insurance Organisation Schemes (ELIOS) project is due to publish in the very near future a report containing recommendations as to how the Commission could support the introduction and promotion of insurance schemes to encourage the wider use of innovative solutions in the sustainable construction sector while taking into account the specific problems encountered by small and craft firms. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I should like the Commission to answer the following questions: — What possible scenarios does the Commission envisage to ensure the this pilot project is continued, particularly in connection with the introduction of the ‘Small Business Act’ and the ‘Think Small First’ principle? — Would it be possible to set up an insurance guarantee fund, using existing or prospective financial instruments managed by the European Investment Fund, to meet these needs and enable SMEs to apply creative solutions? — Do other initiatives or financial instruments exist which could be used in the medium term to encourage innovation and promote eco-technologies in the EU, particularly with a view to encouraging investment by SMEs in general, and very small firms in particular?
