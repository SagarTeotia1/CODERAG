2004/C 84 E/178 WRITTEN QUESTION E-4057/03 by Elspeth Attwooll (ELDR) to the Commission (13 January 2004) Subject: Trans-European telecommunications networks What proportion of rural residents in the EU have broadband internet access, and how does this compare to that in urban areas? What is the projected impact in terms of economic growth of expanding broadband access in rural areas? What role has the Trans-European telecommunications networks policy played in rolling out broadband internet access in rural areas? How might its role increase in the future, and does the Commission foresee the development and adoption of any other policy initiatives that aim specifically to improve the provision of broadband internet access in rural areas, particularly in the light of its work programme commitment to invest further in networks and knowledge? Does the Commission plan to make use of new technologies such as Galileo in this context?
