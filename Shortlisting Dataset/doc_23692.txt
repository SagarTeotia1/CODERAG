Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (24 April 2002) The health conditions applying to live animals imported into the territory of the Community are laid down in various Council directives. With regard to cats and dogs, which seem to be the main focus of the question, these conditions are laid down in Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC OJ L 268, 14.9.1992 . , particularly in its Articles 10 and 16. The general principles governing checks to be carried out on these animals when they enter the territory of the EU are also set out in Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC , 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC OJ L 268, 24.9.1991 . . This Directive particularly states that animals should be subject to systematic checks at the point of entry into the Community, at a border inspection post. In general terms, whilst the initiative for Community legislation lies with the Commission, its implementation is the responsibility of the authorities in the Member States. It is therefore up to the national authorities to ensure the correct implementation of the Community rules in force, and to take all necessary measures to tackle illegal imports and fraud. It would be useful for the Commission to have more detailed information on the circumstances of the illegal imports being reported here so that it can properly look into whether the Member States concerned are complying with the obligations to which they are subject.
