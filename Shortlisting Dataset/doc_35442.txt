WRITTEN QUESTION E-1627/09 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (13 March 2009) Subject: Protection of sheep-farming and cheese production in the Serra da Estrela (Portugal) In the Serra da Estrela area of Portugal, the small-scale producers of the cheese of that name, which is considered one of the world's finest, are currently faced with difficult circumstances: they are obliged to invest in order to obtain licences to breed sheep and operate their dairies, as well as having to pay new official regulatory charges every three months. These charges, justified by the Portuguese Government as being in implementation of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of 29 April 2004, mean that these cheese producers have to meet the costs of health and safety checks, inspection of premises, research into food contaminants, monitoring and eradication of food-related animal diseases, and, in addition, the wages and expenses of the staff employed to make the official checks — not to mention the costs of installations, instruments, equipment, training, travel and related expenditure, as well as laboratory and sampling costs. The local ‘bordaleira’ breed of sheep is subject to strict controls and is the only breed that yields the milk used for the genuine Serra da Estrela cheese. It produces smaller quantities than other breeds whose production is of lower quality, and could become extinct if support is not forthcoming. Can the Commission state: 1. whether it intends to review Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 with a view to exempting small sheep-farmers and traditional cheese producers from charges and requirements which should only be applied to intensive-type industrial producers; 2. what measures it proposes in order to support farmers raising local breeds and ensure that they do not become extinct, a risk now being run in the case of the sheep producing the genuine Serra da Estrela cheese, in other words the only cheese that can be certified as such?
