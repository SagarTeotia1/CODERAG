WRITTEN QUESTION E-6798/08 by Vito Bonsignore (PPE‑DE) and Sebastiano Sanzarello (PPE‑DE) to the Council (19 December 2008) Subject: Contaminated pork from Ireland According to press reports, alarming quantities of dioxin have been found in pork originating from Ireland. Unfortunately, the contaminated meat has already been distributed and sold throughout Europe, creating a very serious public health emergency. It appears that the meat has also been sold in countries outside the European Union, something which will clearly further damage the reputation of EU food products, thanks to the general impression inevitably created by such events. Given that this poses a very serious threat to public health, will the Council answer the following: 1. Is it aware of the true scale of this food emergency, which is concerning and threatening all EU consumers, and will it conduct a detailed enquiry into the real causes of the contamination? 2. What firm measures will it take to find an immediate solution to the problem? 3. What firm measures will it take to prevent health scares of this kind in future? Does it not think that everything should be done to speed up the implementation of all provisions on the traceability and labelling of foodstuffs?
