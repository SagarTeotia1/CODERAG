Reply (28 October 2009) The Council reassures the Honourable Member that the EU strongly supports the US's ongoing efforts aiming at a resumption of meaningful negotiations leading to a two-state solution and comprehensive peace and security in the Middle East. This was the unanimous view of Foreign Ministers of the EU Member States at their informal meeting in Stockholm on 4‑5 September 2009. Meetings in the margins of the ministerial week of the UN General Assembly in September provided an important opportunity for enhancing the coordination and cooperation between the EU and United States and within the Quartet. In light of further developments at the political level and on the ground, the EU will carefully assess how its policies, programmes and instruments can promote concrete and early results on the path to a comprehensive settlement of the conflict.
