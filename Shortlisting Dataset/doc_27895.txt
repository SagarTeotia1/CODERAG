WRITTEN QUESTION E-3614/07 by Maria Matsouka (PSE) to the Commission (16 July 2007) Subject: Greek bill on the media The Greek government recently tabled a bill in the Hellenic Parliament on the concentration and licensing of media enterprises and other provisions which is expected to be put to the vote very soon. Article 17 of this bill provides for the establishment of a subsidiary of ERT (Greek Radio and Television corporation) to develop, inter alia , terrestrial digital services and programmes. However, this presents some difficulties, notably the fact that shareholders of this subsidiary may include private individuals, and that the principal annual source of its revenue will be a percentage of up to 15 % of the duty paid by way of fees and dues to ERT. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. How can steps be taken to ensure that monies raised by the fees and dues to ERT paid by Greek citizens for use for non-profit making purposes will not be used, inter alia , for the commercial activities of the new company? 2. To what extent is it compatible with Community competition law to strengthen this subsidiary financially with ERT's assets, both moveable and immoveable? 3. To what extent are the European competition authorities aware of the situation created by this controversial article in the bill?
