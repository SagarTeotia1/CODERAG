Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (15 April 2011) The fifth Cohesion Report COM(2010)642 final; http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/cohesion5/index_en.cfm in its conclusions, following up the communication from the Commission on the EU budget review, proposes that ‘a performance reserve could be established at EU level to encourage progress towards Europe 2020 targets and related national targets and objectives: a limited share of the cohesion budget would be set aside and be allocated, during a mid‑term review, to the Member States and regions whose programmes have contributed most — compared to their starting point — to the 2020 targets and objectives’. The Commission is currently studying the details of a possible performance reserve, taking into account the results of the recent online public consultation on the conclusions of the fifth Cohesion Report. This includes an examination of criteria on the basis of which an assessment of the achievement of targets could be made and the level of government responsible for setting such criteria and measuring them. Mechanisms to improve the performance orientation of cohesion policy will be included in the legislative proposals for cohesion policy that will follow the Commission's proposal on a Multiannual Financing Framework.
