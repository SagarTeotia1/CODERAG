the legislative simplification process started in 2007, which should make it possible to cut administrative burdens by 25% by 2012; 73. Is aware that the development and implementation of EU policy are dependent on partnership and a commitment by the Member States to their reform programmes; considers, however, that the Commission has a central task in helping Member States to actively promote and develop major EU policies; regards the renewed Lisbon Strategy as an example of the role the Commission can play; Impact assessments 74. Welcomes the assurance given by the Commission that it will conduct comprehensive impact assessments of all legislative measures, including the comitology process, proposed as either strategic or priority initiatives in 2007; 75. Believes that successfully applying the impact assessment process is critical to establishing in the European Union the better lawmaking culture to which all its institutions aspire; takes the view, in that connection, that positive achievements can be acknowledged as regards the integration of impact assessments into the legislative process; 77. Welcomes the Commission’s initiative to withdraw pending legislation; takes the view, nevertheless, that ‘better regulation’ should not lead to total deregulation, but to regulation that, even if it is minimal, could improve the quality of the European regulatory framework; Link between political priorities and budgetary means 78. Emphasises the fact that, in view of the limited budgetary resources available to the European Union, as compared to its needs, the Commission should take particular care to use financial resources well, by better focusing budgetary and human resources, as it pointed out in its resolution on the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy; Bringing placeEurope closer to its citizens 79. Calls on the Commission to step up its efforts to communicate with European citizens and to explain the European project, in order to increase the visibility of the EU, and to include Parliament in this process; furthermore, urges the Commission to cooperate closely with Parliament on the operational proposals resulting from the White Paper on Communication; 80. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the parliaments of the Member States.
