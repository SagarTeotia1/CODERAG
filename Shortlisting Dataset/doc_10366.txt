whole they account for an average of 35%; E) Whereas the main stakeholders are the social partners constituting the governing board of the Servei de Ocupació de Catalunya (the public labour offices of Catalonia): the trade unions Comisión Obrera Nacional de Cataluña and Unión General de Trabajadores, two employers' organizations: Foment del Treball and PIMEC , and two associations representing the town halls of Catalonia; F) Whereas the closedown of Lear brought an increase of 4 % in the unemployment rate of the territory, which in 2009 was already 22,7 % while in Catalonia as a whole it was 17,5 %; G) Whereas 67,1% of the targeted workers are women and whereas 84,5% of those targeted are between 35 and 54 years old and 11,2% are over 55 years old; H) Whereas three of the targeted workers are disabled; I) Whereas 92,9% of the targeted workers are plant and machine operators; J) Whereas 74,8% of the targeted workers have only basic education and whereas 15,2% have upper secondary education; K) Whereas the experience of Spain with EGF cases shows that not all redundant workers will participate in the measures offered; whereas, therefore, the number of active participants can be only an estimate, and whereas the financial plan is calculated according to this estimate; whereas, by doing so, Spain avoids incurring the reimbursement of large amounts of unused EU contributions; Therefore, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to integrate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution concerning the Spanish application: 1. Agrees with the Commission that the conditions for a financial contribution under the EGF regulation are met; 2. Notes that the total number of participants in the proposed measures is an estimate based on experiences with previous applications; 3. Recalls application EGF/2010/002 ES/Cataluna automoción that covered 1.429 out of 2.330 redundancies in the same region and the same sector and notes that it was decided not to include the redundancies of this application as the enterprise had agreed to finance a social plan; notes further that this social plan is less complete than the EGF package presented in EGF/2010/002 and that by submitting the present application, the Spanish authorities aim to provide the workers made redundant by Lear with a package of personalised services similar to the package proposed for workers dismissed in the same region and the same economic sector and covered by the previous application; 4. Notes that the EGF measures have a uniqueness and special character as they address a sector and a particular population, and that they are tailor-made and have an intensive format; notes further that continuous follow-up of ESF and EGF actions pursuing similar purposes and the workers concerned will prevent any overlap between ESF and EGF measures; 5. Welcomes the timely start of the measures (6 months after the first dismissals); reminds the Member States of the importance of taking immediate labour market measures in parallel with their application to the EGF; 6. Welcomes the active involvement of the Social Partners in
