Answer given by Mrs Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a zoonosis that may affect humans and it is also a major constraint for the sustainability of cattle husbandry in Europe. The Commission follows the TB situation in the Member States very closely and is aware that the situation of TB in the United Kingdom is worrying with an increase of incidence in certain areas of the country. However, the disease is unevenly distributed and is concentrated mainly in East England and Wales while the percentage of infected herds in Scotland is significantly lower. A slight decrease in the percentage of infected herds has been observed in Northern Ireland in the last years. The situation in the rest of EU is favourable with most Member States recognised as officially free from TB or with an extremely low number of outbreaks. In general, there is an improving trend. However, there are limited areas where the progress towards eradication of the disease is not as rapid as desired. The situation in those still infected Member States is heterogeneous and comprises regions with very different epidemiological situations. Nevertheless, the trends on the epidemiological indicators of the disease show a steady decrease in the percentage of infected herds in most Member States.
