Question for written answer E-7521/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Martin Ehrenhauser (NI) (24 September 2010) Subject: Indect Project being kept secret According to a report of 8 September 2010 by Telepolis, information concerning the Indect Project is only allowed to reach the public in filtered form. This new information strategy has apparently been chosen as they are engaged in explaining what the project ‘is not about’ and feel ‘misunderstood’ by reporters and data protectionists. 1. Can the Commission confirm these reports? 2. Were there other reasons for changing the information strategy? 3. What is the Commission’s view of this information strategy? 4. In a democratic state it is a routine matter to deal with misunderstandings by means of public debate and by publishing explanations, so as to allow critical public discussion of the current policy situation. But discussion of the Indect Project is being nipped in the bud by keeping documents secret. Does the Commission share this view? 5. There appears to be public concern that current data protection standards could be undermined by this project. How does the Commission propose to meet this concern if at the same time the secrecy surrounding this project is increasing, thus fanning the flames of public hostility? 6. How will the Commission ensure there is maximum transparency with this project from now on? 7. Is the Commission interested in a public debate on the subject of Indect? How will the Commission support such a debate?
