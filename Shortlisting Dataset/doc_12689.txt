WRITTEN QUESTION P-2299/10 by Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (6 April 2010) Subject: Illegal use of destructive Danish seine nets in Greek waters A recent letter (1401 of 8 March 2010) from the Greek Fishing Federation to the Greek Prime Minister and competent ministers complained about the continued use of destructive Danish seine nets in Greek waters. Similar complaints have also been made by environmental organisations. As far as the allocation of codes for fishing gear is concerned (Regulations (EC) Nos 26/2004 OJ L 5, 9.1.2004, p. 25. and 1799/2006 OJ L 341, 7.12.2006, p. 26. ), this type of gear does not exist for the European Union. The previous government, however, using procedures that were less than transparent, gave it the code SB, corresponding to a type of fishing gear abolished under national law. As a result, it could continue to be used illegally. This fishing gear is still used today, thanks to a decision taken by the previous government on the basis of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 OJ L 409, 30.12.2006, p. 9. concerning transitional derogations. After 31 May 2010 Danish seine nets, which benefited from an adaptation period, will be covered by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006, which bans their use. Even though this gear is being used illegally with a false code, and despite its harmful effects for marine habitats and the fact that all the bodies representing the fishing industry have called for an immediate ban, the minister for rural development in the new government intends to retain this gear for a further two years whilst proposing a corresponding management plan. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Will it tolerate the use of this destructive fishing gear in Greek waters after 31 May 2010, in contravention of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006? 2. What steps will it take to end the derogations from the application of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 used by the various governments? Will it continue to allow the Greek government to violate this regulation with regard to trawling up to a mile from the coastline as well? 3. Does it consider it legitimate that Danish seine nets were given a code and could be used in Greek waters up to 31 May 2010?
