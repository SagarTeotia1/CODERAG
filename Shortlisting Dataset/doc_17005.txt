Question for written answer E-009015/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (11 October 2011) Subject: Right to appeal in the event of an infringement of intellectual property rights in Greece Greek Law 2121/1993, amended by Law 3049/2002, regulates intellectual property rights and the operation of copyright collection societies. The law defines infringements of intellectual property rights as ‘administrative infringements’, which means that the state becomes a party that can use its instruments (police etc.) to detect infringements and impose fines on behalf of copyright collection societies (OSD), some of which take the form of private companies. Even though it is a case of a civil-law dispute between a company and a citizen, infringements are prosecuted and the police can take action. This results in an administrative infringement being recorded, and the state is entitled to carry out checks and impose fines. Infringements of intellectual property rights thus become flagrant criminal offences for which prosecution is mandatory, and the possibility for any user to contest the tariffs set by the OSD responsible for protecting the intellectual property in the courts is obstructed. The Commission has already stated that ‘it is essential for users to be in a position to contest the tariffs, be it through access to the courts, specially created mediation tribunals or with the assistance of public authorities which supervise the activities of collecting societies’. Accordingly, can the Commission answer the following question: Does it know whether corresponding regulations exist in other Member States similarly restricting the right of users to contest the tariffs? Will it look into the above situation, also in cooperation with the Greek authorities, with a view to the introduction of legal provisions that are indispensable in order to safeguard the rights of users and ensure the harmonised application of intellectual property rights?
