Answer given by Mr Sefcovic on behalf of the Commission (26 October 2009) Whilst acknowledging the sensitivity of the case for the local community and beyond, the Commission recalls that it does not have legal competence in the matter. Community action in the field of culture is based on Article 151 of the EC Treaty. Article 151 provides that Community action shall be aimed at encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, supporting and supplementing their action in the areas specified in the article, including conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage of European significance. Protection and promotion of national cultural heritage including ensuring conformity with international law obligations falls under the authority of Member States.
