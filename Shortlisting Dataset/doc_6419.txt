2002/C 205 E/078 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0114/02 by Markus Ferber (PPE-DE) to the Commission (29 January 2002) Subject: Publication European Dialogue Up to 1999 the then DG 1A published the quarterly magazine European Dialogue , which was translated into all the Eastern European languages and which was intended to inform the public in these countries about the benefits of EU membership. When Commissioner Verheugen assumed office the magazine was abruptly discontinued. The Commission terminated the contract and had to pay the publisher a six-figure sum as compensation for the fact that European Dialogue would no longer be published. How much compensation was paid? How much had it previously cost to publish the magazine? Why were no attempts made to improve or change the magazine's quality and content? If the magazine and its editorial staff were so bad and supposedly beyond correction that the publication contract had to be terminated ahead of time, with the high compensation costs this entailed, why did the magazine exist unchallenged for so long and at such great expense?
