year n and n-1 paid in year n) while the method for the calculation of the UK rebate uses accrual expenditure data (information available only in year n+2 on payments under payments appropriations for year n, paid in year n or carried forward and paid in year n+1), b) in accordance with point 75 of the conclusions of the 1999 European Council meeting in Berlin: ‘When referring to budgetary imbalances, the Commission, for presentational purposes, will base itself on operational expenditure’ the method presented in the report takes into account only ‘operating’ allocated expenditure (i.e. excluding administrative expenditure - EU expenditure on salaries of its staff, rental of offices, etc.) while the method used for the calculation of the UK rebate takes into account total allocated expenditure (i.e. including administrative expenditure). as used for the calculation of the correction of budgetary imbalances in favour of the United Kingdom (UK) (the UK rebate), which is the only method that has a degree of formal recognition, being based on the 1984 Fontainebleau agreement and actually used to calculate the financial compensation granted to the UK. Under the method used by the Commission (the “UK rebate method”) payments of traditional own resources (TOR) are not allocated by Member State. Due to their very nature – i.e. duties levied as part of a customs union where goods and services circulate freely – they cannot be accurately apportioned to individual Member States. They are therefore treated as revenue belonging to the EU rather than as “national” contributions to the EU budget. Furthermore, budgetary balances by Member State are set to equal total EU expenditure allocated to Member States in order for the sum of all Member States’ balances to add up to zero, the purpose being to compare Member States’ relative positions vis-à-vis the EU budget. The report from the Danish Ministry of Finance that the Honourable Member refers to (Økonomisk Redegørelse 2004) does not specify how the net balances therein have been calculated. The Commission suggests that the Honourable Member addresses this question directly to the Danish Ministry of Finance. Denmark’s budgetary balance vis-à-vis the EU budget during the period 1995–2003, according to the method used by the Commission in its report ‘Allocation of 2003 EU operating expenditure by Member State’, is set out in table 1 below A detailed description of the method can be found on pages 101–103 of the 2003 allocated expenditure report : Table 1.
