2002/C 205 E/113 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0253/02 by Mihail Papayannakis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (6 February 2002) Subject: Clophen leak at the DEI steam electric station at Agios Dimitrios in Kozani On 25 December 2001 an explosion was recorded in the high voltage transformer at the Greek Electricity Board (DEI) steam electric station at Agios Dimitrios in Kozani, resulting in the leak of toxic gases, such as Clophen and dioxins. In fact, it was confirmed that of the condensers' three Clophen containers (each condenser contains 20-30 kilos of Clophen), two were empty, and those responsible concluded that there had been a leak of this dangerous substance. Under Directive 96/59/EC OJ L 243, 24.9.1996, p. 31 . on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCB/PCT), the Member States must ensure that inventories are compiled of equipment with PCB volumes of more than 5 dm 3 , must send summaries of such inventories to the Commission at the latest three years after the adoption of the Directive, and must draw up plans for the decontamination and/or disposal of inventoried equipment and the PCBs contained therein, together with outlines for the collection and subsequent disposal of equipment. In addition, there is considerable concern over the effects which these toxic substances may have on public health. In view of the above, can the Commission say whether the relevant Greek authorities are implementing the above directive and whether they have sent the Commission, under Directive 78/319/EEC OJ L 84, 31.3.1978, p. 43 . , a situation report on the disposal of toxic and dangerous waste in Greece, and if so when?
