Question for written answer P-010778/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Pilar Ayuso (PPE) (15 December 2010) Subject: Malpractice in French distilleries For several years France has been producing fake spirits and wine distillates marketed for the production of spirit drinks (brandy or weinbrand). The Commission has already received several parliamentary questions on this topic, the first more than six months ago, but so far it has not taken any steps to put an end to the malpractice in France. This malpractice involves using the by-products of wine production as the raw materials for producing spirits and wine distillates. After being processed, the by-products (marc and lees) are marketed as wine and used to produce these above spirit drinks. France is systematically contravening Community regulations. Firstly, it is not respecting the Community definition of wine, which applies only to the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or grape juice, never by-products. Secondly, it is not meeting the definitions laid down in the regulation on spirit drinks. What does the Commission's legal service think about these practices? Has the Spanish Government or any other Member State taken any steps to persuade the Commission to put a stop to this malpractice?
