WRITTEN QUESTION E-6623/07 by Pedro Guerreiro (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (15 January 2008) Subject: Situation of the textile and clothing sector in the European Union — extension of the import surveillance system The Commission and the Chinese Government agreed on a system of joint import surveillance relating to textiles and clothing from China for the year 2008. In its resolution of 13 December 2007 on the future of the textile sector after 2007 ( P6_TA(2007)0628 , the European Parliament stressed that a double-checking system could not be implemented in 2008 alone and that an effective surveillance system should be guaranteed for a longer period of time. Does the Commission not consider it necessary and possible to extend this surveillance system to EU textile and clothing imports?
