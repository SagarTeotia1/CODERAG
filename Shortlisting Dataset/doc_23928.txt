to approach the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission directly; Use of experts 18. Considers that the minimum standards which the Commission proposes and the three basic principles applied in this connection - openness, effectiveness and quality - are a good step towards greater harmonisation and clarity of the use of experts; 19. Recognises the added value of experts as a source of information during the legislative process; expresses, however, a decided preference for parliamentary democracy over a democracy of experts; urges the Commission, therefore, to publish the evidence and the way in which it is used in the legislative process so as to inform the European Parliament about how fundamental policy choices are made; 20. Is critical of the fact that there are still no clear lists showing what committees and working groups the Commission has consulted, although the Commission announced the publication of these lists by June 2001 in its 2000 White Paper on Reform of the Commission White Paper: Reforming the Commission – Part II – Action Plan, IV – 3 ( COM(2000) 200 ). , and reiterates therefore its previous call for the Commission to attach to each legislative proposal or communication a list of all committees, experts, associations, organisations, institutions and other parties consulted for the purpose of drafting those documents; 21. Urges the Commission to maintain constant dialogue also with representatives of local and regional authorities during the preparatory stage in order to increase the practicability and acceptance of legislation at an early stage; notes in this connection that these representatives, who have direct experience of the ultimate implementation and handling of European Union policies and rules, are either themselves elected representatives or have to be monitored by elected representatives of the people; also hopes that a more systematic consultation procedure between the Commission and representatives of the relevant European organisations can be established at an early stage, when the Commission submits initiatives; considers that this consultation requirement should be standardised and publicised; Global governance 22.

Considers that the EU should attach higher priority to the consistency of its policy and therefore, in all policy decisions, should take account of the possible impact of decisions on third countries, on the basis of the fundamental principles laid down in the Treaty; 24. Considers that the recent failure of the WTO Conference in Cancun demonstrates the need to reform the rules, procedures and decision-making mechanisms of the WTO in order to create a more efficient, transparent and democratic organisation in which a parliamentary dimension must comprise an important element; calls on the Commission to make proposals to this end; 25. Considers that the EU's own international representation should be so revised that in the near future the European Union can be represented by a seat of its own in international organisations; 26. Hopes that, as proposed in the draft constitution, a reinforced EU will in
