Answer given by Mrs Kuneva on behalf of the Commission (29 January 2007) The Commission attaches great importance to the fire safety of services for the consumer. Therefore, the Commission has been holding discussions with Member States on fire safety in hotels with a view to exploring whether a more harmonised approach throughout the EU would be beneficial. Discussions are ongoing; so far the Commission has not had the necessary support of Member States for concrete action. There are no regulations concerning the fire safety of campsites at EU level; Member States did not raise this issue in the abovementioned discussions.
