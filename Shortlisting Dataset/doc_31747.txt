Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (14 June 2011) The issue raised by the Honourable Member is also a concern for the Commission. This is why, as a follow-up to Parliamentary Questions E‑0825/10 and E‑0104/10 by Ms Lucas and Mr Gerbrandy http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB , the Commission organised a workshop on marine litter in Brussels in November 2010 For more information: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/marine/pollution.htm . It also actively participated at the recent held International Conference on Marine Debris in Hawaii, organised by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USA/NOAA). And it organised an informative event in Athens, in April 2011. UNEP has called marine litter a ‘dire, vast and growing threat’. The Commission is determined to address it and make full use of the tools at its disposal, ranging from awareness-raising to legal instruments and the funding of research. For example the Commission has recently adopted a decision for the financing of a pilot project on plastic recycling cycle and marine environmental impact C(2011) 3227 dated 17 May 2011. See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/funding/pdf/awp_plastic_recycling.pdf , as proposed by the European Parliament. The main component of marine litter is plastic waste. In this context, during the Environment Council of 14 March 2011, Ministers discussed the problem of plastic bags and some Ministers asked the Commission to consider possible action on European level to tackle the problem, given the high negative impact on the environment of the mass of single-use plastic bags put into circulation annually within the European Union. The Commission has just launched a public consultation on options to reduce the use of plastic carrier bags and improve requirements for biodegradability http://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/plasticbags_en.htm . The Commission can refer to the answer to Written Questions E‑000095/2011 by Mr Arsenis, E‑002302/2011 by Ms Rosbach and E‑3683/2011 by Mr Rossi. Marine litter is a complex issue. Coordination and cooperation will be key. This is why the Commission considers the possibility of launching a political initiative on marine litter in the coming months.
