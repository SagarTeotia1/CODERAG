The report comes under the consultation procedure, which means that Parliament's opinion is needed and MEPs can propose amendments although these are non-binding. The final decision lies with the Council of Ministers. MEPs are asking the Commission to present a report to Parliament one year after the start of the agreement on its implementation and on its effect on human rights and democratisation and, should there be no improvement in human rights and democracy, to consider what steps are necessary. MEPs also adopted - by 394 votes in favour and none against with 4 abstentions - a resolution on the human rights situation in Pakistan to accompany the legislative resolution on the cooperation agreement. MEPs recognise the difficult decision taken by Pakistan to join the international community in its fight against terrorism. The resolution draws attention to the general electoral process in 2002, which it describes as "flawed" . MEPs are critical of the continued influence of the military in the Musharraf government, believing this goes very much against the spirit of the roadmap for the restoration of democracy, which "was supposed to transfer power from military rule to a civilian administration" . MEPs are also "extremely disturbed" at human rights abuses, including the treatment of women, children and journalists and the problems relating to freedom of expression. It regrets that the 'madrassas' (religious schools) are not under state control. MEPs also note that many extremist groups banned after September 11 have resurfaced under different names. They also point to the serious concerns of the international community about Pakistan's role in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Finally, they acknowledge the bold initiative taken by Pakistan to normalise relations with India, and India's correspondingly positive response. They welcome the subsequent thaw in relations between the two countries, making the prospects for resolving the Kashmir issue "better than they have been for years."
