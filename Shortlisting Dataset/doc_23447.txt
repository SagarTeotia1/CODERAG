in the EU's trade relations with states which are not bound by multilateral environmental protection agreements, such as the United States, China and India, which, for various reasons, are not implementing the Kyoto Protocol; also calls on the Commission to assist developing countries in the deployment of sustainable and efficient technologies through all mechanisms available; 35. Recommends that a sustainability clause be added to the WTO, setting out principles of environmental policy, such as the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, against which trade measures can be judged, in order to ensure that trade rules do not undermine environmental protection and that environmental regulation is not used for the purposes of protectionism; 36. Calls on the Council and the Commission to use bilateral and regional trade negotiations to address trade commitments that have direct environmental benefits; considers that the EU, together with the Member States, needs to intensify dialogue with emerging economies in order to turn the dialogue in areas of mutual concern, such as climate change, waste management and illegal logging, into the implementation of joint programmes; supports the Commission's proposal to establish a Sustainable Development Forum, open to the participation of civil society, with a strong climate component, in each trade agreement and calls for this to be implemented in the current negotiations; 37. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote a more pragmatic and horizontal exploitation of innovation and new technologies in all EU policies, so that those elements play a pivotal role in strengthening the preservation of the environment; stresses the need to introduce without delay an EU 'top runner' approach, a more ambitious ongoing improvement instrument for production and consumption patterns, to ensure that, in future, all EU market products are conceived, produced and used in accordance with sustainability criteria; 38. Recalls that investing in innovative, environmentally friendly technologies and in eco-design, energy end-use efficiency and energy performance of buildings is very beneficial in the long term, despite possible high short-term costs, and emphasises the need for regions to encourage companies to take full advantage of such investments; 39. Encourages the Commission and Member States to adopt genuinely 'green' public procurement rules in order to promote innovation and sustainable consumption and production patterns; 40. Calls on the Commission to assist national, regional and local authorities to engage in joint sustainable procurements by providing a clear framework to facilitate the definition of measurable objectives and quality criteria; 41. Calls on the Commission to intensify its efforts to achieve the 20% target for renewables and the 10% target for biofuel consumption keeping in mind that energy crops must not jeopardise food supplies in Europe and elsewhere; stresses that the sustainability mechanism, which is at the development stage, should apply the most stringent sustainability criteria to biofuels; 42. Points out that agriculture in the EU is increasingly geared to the production of safe, high-quality foods which will protect the health of Union citizens; 43. Encourages the Member States and their regional and local authorities to make optimal use of the new investment opportunities provided by the
