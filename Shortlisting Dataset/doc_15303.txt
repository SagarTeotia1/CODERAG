the conditions for a modern economy, in particular through new information technologies, development of new services and creation of new businesses; strongly believes that in managing industrial change the EU must create sustainable economic development through competitiveness based on quality, initiative and innovation and a European social model based on effective social protection, equality of opportunity, adaptability and employability; 6. Considers that the right to lifelong learning should be included in the Charter for Fundamental Rights; calls on the Council and the Member States to develop preventive employability strategies, increasing the possibility for training and lifelong learning; points out that this coordinating centre for industrial change may provide data and information on the early identification of needs in this field; 7. Believes that a “managing change report”, i.e. an annual report on employment and working conditions to be produced once per year by large firms in the EU as recommended by the 'Gyllenhammar Group', would allow best practice to be disseminated widely by the Observatory, to encourage companies to improve their own policies and procedures; considers that the “managing change report” could be a part of conditions/commitments which may attached to the authorisation of a merger under the EEC Merger Regulation 4064/89; 8. Reminds the social partners of their responsibility in consolidating the strategy on employment, economic reforms and social cohesion, defined in Lisbon; calls on them in particular to take concrete steps towards agreements on temporary work, telework and lifelong learning; 9. Calls on the Member States and on the Commission to promote and step up dialogue between management and labour and co-operation at company and regional levels, including information policy on the right on consultation of 'third parties' or 'third persons' under the EEC Merger Regulation 4064/89, Article 18, in order to hear views on observations against a merger with a view to establishing arrangements for prior consultation and dialogue on decisions with major economic and social implications; 10. Calls on the Council to adopt at the earliest opportunity a common position on the proposal on a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community; points out that the development of social dialogue in undertakings presupposes advance information and consultation, including not only the organisation of work and the social repercussion of the restructuring, but also the innovation processes in technologies and the general guidelines of industrial and employment policy; 11. Calls on the Commission to draw up urgently an evaluation of the application of the directive on collective redundancies and company closures and to make proposals for effective sanctions in the event of non-observance, and to propose improvements to the directive to make it more effective in protecting jobs and defending employees; 12. Insists that the Commission should expedite its review of Directive 94/45/EC on the establishment of a European Works Council, in particular to strengthen information and consultation so that it takes place before decision-making, during the planning stage, to ensure that information and consultation are effective and that influence can be exercised; 13. Calls on the Council and Commission to revise the EEC Merger
