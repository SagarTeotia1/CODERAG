Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (11 December 2006) The Commission regrets any damage to the cultural and religious heritage of Cyprus. The issue reported by the Honourable Member indicates the urgent need for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue which would facilitate resolution of such matters by the two communities on the island. In line with its long-standing position, the Commission remains fully committed to supporting a resumption of the United Nations (UN)-led talks for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue as soon as possible.
