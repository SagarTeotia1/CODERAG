Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (20 October 2011) With regard to the Honourable Member's question on the value of counterfeit goods, the Commission publishes a report each year on customs enforcement of intellectual property rights. The report is based upon data made available to the Commission by the customs administrations of the Member States and, for the first time, the 2010 report http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/counterfeit_piracy/statistics/index_en.htm published on 14 July 2011 contained a section on value. It was estimated that the equivalent domestic retail value of the articles intercepted by customs in 2010 amounted to EUR 1.1 billion. It should be noted that this figure relates to all products suspected of infringing intellectual property rights, not just counterfeit goods intercepted by customs on the basis of Council Regulation 1383/2003 OJ L 196, 2.8.2003. . This regulation sets out the conditions for action by the customs authorities at the external borders of the EU with regard to goods suspected of infringing intellectual property rights. Customs enforcement of intellectual property rights is carried out alongside a wide range of other control activities and costs are therefore not directly attributed to this activity. Specific costs such as the storage and destruction of infringing goods are the responsibility of the right holder. Data is not available on the value of counterfeit goods which escape detection, either at the border or on the internal market. However, the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy has been tasked with developing statistical data and a methodology is currently being developed to produce information in this domain.
