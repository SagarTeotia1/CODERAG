ORAL QUESTION H-0304/02 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Anne Van Lancker to the Council Subject: Availability of Council meeting and committee documents Since the start of the Lisbon procedure the Council, together with the Commission, has become the pivot of a number of coordination procedures. In the committees on economic policy, employment and the labour market and social protection important work is done, which is then discussed and approved by the Council, with no input from Parliament: drafting of common reports by the Council and Commission on employment, exclusion and pensions, as well as on objectives and indicators in the fight against poverty, a subject which also involves pensions. Sometimes, also, the European Council refers to these documents, without their being publicly available. Is the Council prepared to forward these documents drafted by the Commission and the other committees to Parliament? Is it possible to publish documents approved by the Council in the OJ and on the website? Is the Council prepared to collaborate in seeking a procedure which would enable Parliament to be more involved in decision-making under these procedures?
