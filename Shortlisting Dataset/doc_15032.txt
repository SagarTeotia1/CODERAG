Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (18 February 2009) The deliberate poisoning of wild birds, including birds of prey, is an illegal activity under Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 103, 25.4.1979. . It is the responsibility of each Member State to put in place the requisite system of protection to prevent this problem and to take the necessary action to address it where it occurs. While concerned about the recent reports about this problem in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the Commission has not been provided with evidence to support a view that this is a significant and widespread problem throughout the Community. The Commission will examine any such evidence that is brought to its attention with a view to ensuring correct implementation of the Birds Directive in each Member State.
