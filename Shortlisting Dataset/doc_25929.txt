Member States within the recommendations that have been made, and doing so in a positive way; 5. Notes that the open coordination method tends to favour the proliferation of the preparatory formations and forums known collectively as ‘committees’; takes the view, in this connection, that the formal establishment of a high-level working party responsible for equal opportunities issues, made up of representatives/experts of the Member States, the social partners and NGOs, could help to bring a good level of expertise to the framing, implementation and follow-up of equal opportunities policy; takes the view that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities should be fully involved and consulted, in order to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of the open coordination method; 6. Is aware of current trends and wishes to safeguard democratic debate by, for example: – organising debates with the relevant committees of the parliaments of the Member States with a view to probing in depth into developments and discussions in the Member States; – regularly inviting representatives of the Employment Committee, the Social Protection Committee, and the Economic Policy Committee to in-depth discussions of developments related to European coordination and in the Member States; – organising discussions with the social partners at European level on applying the open method of coordination in specific areas; – disseminating the necessary information through the Internet for each adjustment of the open coordination method; 7. Calls on the Council and the Commission to take greater account of the European Parliament’s observations when establishing guidelines; calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure the European Parliament has the necessary time to draw up informed and high-quality opinions; the European Parliament undertakes to ascertain whether it would be appropriate to adjust its practices and procedures to its role as a democratic and proactive participant in the open method of coordination; 8. Calls on the Council, the Commission and Parliament to ensure that the application of the open method of coordination: – does not serve as a fig leaf for a country’s failure to take action; – cannot be used as a means of replacing more binding forms of Community regulation, for the express purpose of avoiding such regulation and, at the same time, undermining the whole concept of the European Social Model; 9. Notes that, given that the open coordination method (OCM) is intended to be applied to a series of areas having direct implications for women, including the European strategy on employment and the policy for combating social exclusion, it is necessary to include the dimension of equal opportunities for men and women and gender mainstreaming at all levels of formalisation of this new policy management instrument; 10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the parliaments of Member States and the Economic and Social Committee; in view of the debate currently taking place in the Convention, also asks for the resolution to be forwarded to the President of the Convention.
