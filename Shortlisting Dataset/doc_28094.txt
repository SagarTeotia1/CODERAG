WRITTEN QUESTION E-1881/04 by Nirj Deva (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 September 2004) Subject: Criminal justice in the Maldives Is the Commission aware of the serious flaws in the criminal justice system in the Maldives, whereby citizens of the Maldives have been arbitrarily detained, suffered unfair trial, torture and ill-treatment, this in defiance of their fundamental rights? Is it not concerned by the fact that falsely accused prisoners are often denied adequate legal defence, even the most basic facilities such as pen and paper with which to prepare written defence statements? How does the Commission view the politically motivated and grossly unfair trials of founding signatories of the Maldivian Democratic Party, Mohamed Nasheed, Abdulla Shakir, and Naushad Waheed, who was tried without a lawyer or the opportunity to defend himself? Is not the Commission concerned by the politically motivated arrests of such influential figures as Abdul Rasheed, Ibrahim Ahmed Maniku, Umar Jamal, Mohamed Latheef, Abdul Hannan, Abdul Aziz, Ismail Saadiq, Ibrahim Fareed, Mohammed Munvaar and Ibrahim Hussain Zaki, not to mention the 180 Maldivian citizens arrested following pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this month? Does not the Commission view the arrest of MPs and citizens whose political views even marginally oppose those of the Government as a dangerous breach of fundamental human rights and democratic values? When the Commission is notified of the victims of legal injustice, is it aware that, when measured by population, the imprisonment of 1 Maldive citizen is equivalent to that of 881 American citizens?
