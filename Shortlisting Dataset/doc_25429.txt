Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (19 January 2012) The European Union noted that new parliamentary electoral legislation passed by the Verkhovna Rada in November 2011 was adopted by a broad consensus of more than 80 % of the votes, with support from Members of Parliament of all parties. The EU welcomes the fact that a number of the Venice Commission proposals were included in the law, though it regrets that others were not also taken into consideration. The EU has repeatedly called for an electoral code which should be valid for all elections. The EU will also continue to strongly condemn acts of selective or politically motivated justice in Ukraine, including in the case of Yulia Tymoshenko, and to insist that judicial measures must not be used to neutralize political opponents. At the EU‑Ukraine Summit on 19 December 2011, the leaders discussed developments related to both electoral and judicial reforms in Ukraine. They recognised the importance of pursuing these reforms in a transparent and inclusive manner, with the involvement of the opposition, and significant participation from civil society representatives.
