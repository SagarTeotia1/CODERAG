ORAL QUESTION H-0796/07 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Mairead McGuinness to the Commission Subject: State of negotiation of EPAs with the ACP group of countries Can the Commission outline how far the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with the ACP group of countries have progressed? There is growing concern, particularly in certain African countries, that these new agreements will undermine the process of sustainable development which has underpinned all previous trade agreements. In addition, there is a perception that these agreements will disproportionately benefit the EU, at the expense of its trading partners in the ACP. Does the Commission believe that this is in the EU's long-term interests? Is it likely that new EPAs with the ACP group of countries will enter into force on 1 January 2008, as planned? If not, does the Commission intend putting transitional measures in place until an agreement can be reached? If so, what type of transitional measures would the Commission consider putting in place?
