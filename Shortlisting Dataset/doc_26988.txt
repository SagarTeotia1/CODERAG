{ "context": [ [ "Polyoxometalate", [ "In chemistry, a polyoxometalate (abbreviated POM) is a polyatomic ion, usually an anion, that consists of three or more transition metal oxyanions linked together by shared oxygen atoms to form closed 3-dimensional frameworks.", " The metal atoms are usually group 6 (Mo, W) or less commonly group 5 (V, Nb, Ta) transition metals in their high oxidation states.", " They are usually colorless or orange, diamagnetic anions. Two broad families are recognized, isopolymetalates, composed of only one kind of metal and oxide, and heteropolymetalates, composed of one metal, oxide, and a main group oxyanion (phosphate, silicate, etc.).", " Many exceptions to these general statements exist." ] ], [ "Nowotny phase", [ "In inorganic chemistry, a Nowotny chimney ladder phase (NCL phase) is a particular intermetallic crystal structure found with certain binary compounds. NLC phases are generally tetragonal and are composed of two separate sublattices.", " The first is a tetragonal array of transition metal atoms, generally from group 4 through group 9 of the periodic table.", " Contained within this array of transition metal atoms is a second network of main group atoms, typically from group 13 (boron group) or group 14 (carbon group).", " The transition metal atoms form a chimney with helical zigzag chain.", " The main-group elements form a ladder spiraling around the transition metal helix." ] ], [ "Propane", [ "Propane ( ) is a three-carbon alkane with the molecular formula CH.", " It is a gas at standard temperature and pressure, but compressible to a transportable liquid.", " A by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining, it is commonly used as a fuel for barbecue grills. Propane is one of a group of liquefied petroleum gases (LP gases).", " The others include butane, propylene, butadiene, butylene, isobutylene, and mixtures thereof." ] ], [ "Diatomic molecule", [ "Diatomic molecules are molecules composed of only two atoms, of the same or different chemical elements.", " The prefix \"di-\" is of Greek origin, meaning \"two\".", " If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen (H) or oxygen (O), then it is said to be homonuclear.", " Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide (NO), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear." ] ], [ "Carbon–carbon bond", [ "A carbon–carbon bond is a covalent bond between two carbon atoms.", " The most common form is the single bond: a bond composed of two electrons, one from each of the two atoms.", " The carbon–carbon single bond is a sigma bond and is formed between one hybridized orbital from each of the carbon atoms.", " In ethane, the orbitals are sp-hybridized orbitals, but single bonds formed between carbon atoms with other hybridisations do occur (e.g. sp to sp).", " In fact, the carbon atoms in the single bond need not be of the same hybridisation.", " Carbon atoms can also form double bonds in compounds called alkenes or triple bonds in compounds called alkynes.", " A double
