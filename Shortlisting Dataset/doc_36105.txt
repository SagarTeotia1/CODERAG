Joint answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-3161/10 , E-3744/10 (25 June 2010) The Commission would like to reiterate to the Honourable Member that the European Union strongly condemns discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, or on any other grounds. The EU takes action at the UN level on the issue of religious freedom, including. support for the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. The EU is convinced that freedom of religion or belief is an integral part of EU human rights policy. In all countries, preserving freedom requires non-discriminatory legislation, applied through respect for the rule of law and an independent judiciary, as well as intercultural and interfaith dialogue and education. The EU remains vigilant on these issues and therefore attaches great importance to reports of intolerance and repression that religious minorities, including Christians, are facing in many countries of the world. The Commission constantly monitors the respect for human rights in Morocco, including religious freedom. The EU will raise the situation of the Christian community in Morocco, including the specific case you raise in your question, in its regular dialogue with that country.
