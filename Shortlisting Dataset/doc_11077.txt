Question for Question Time H-000053/2011 to the Commission Part-session: February 2011 Rule 116 Laima Liucija Andrikienė (PPE) Subject: Protection of investments in the context of EU-Russia negotiations on the new partnership and cooperation agreement Does the Commission raise issues relating to investment protection, especially in the energy sector, in its negotiations with the Russian Federation on the new partnership and cooperation agreement? Drawing on a number of cases when European energy companies were forced out of the Russian market without the possibility to seek impartial and fair local judicial protection, does the Commission intend to include an investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanism in the new partnership agreement or additional economic agreements with the Russian Federation? What is the position of the Commission with regard to the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)? Is the Commission still hopeful that the Russian Government might again sign the ECT and eventually ratify it? Or will similar provisions relating to the protection of investments in the energy sector be included in the new partnership agreement?
