ORAL QUESTION H-0188/07 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou to the Council Subject: Updating the Directive on 'Television Without Frontiers' and combating violence and discrimination In the context of updating the Community Directive on audiovisual media, known by the title 'Television Without Frontiers', does the Council intend to adopt a common policy against the use of violence and material offensive to human dignity, in particular when the media target children and young people or the content of their programmes concerns women's issues and disadvantaged social groups? Is it possible that heightening the awareness of members of the Council in regard to the above matters is of more crucial importance than rules relating to the free market, competition and the international obligations of the Union?
