WRITTEN QUESTION E-1186/07 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 March 2007) Subject: Rules on summer-time arrangements Since the entry into force of Directive 2000/84/EC OJ L 31, 2.2.2001, p. 21. on summer-time arrangements a common date and time for the beginning and end of the summer-time period has been fixed throughout the European Union. Under Article 5 the Commission is required to publish a report on the implementation of the directive by 31 December 2007 at the latest and may, if necessary, put forward proposals for amending the provisions. When, precisely, will the Commission be publishing its assessment report? Does the Commission intend to include any other points in its assessment apart from the impact of the directive, and any proposals for amendment, in the area of the environment, energy, public health, transport and traffic safety, recreation and tourism? Is the Commission in contact with international partners on this matter, and if so which? Is the Commission aware of the plans by the United States to extend summer time by several weeks in 2007?
