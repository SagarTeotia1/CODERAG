attention to this aspect in its approach to Roma inclusion; 5. Considers that the EU and the Member States share a responsibility to promote the inclusion of Roma and uphold their fundamental rights as European citizens and urgently need to step up their efforts to achieve visible results in this area; calls on the Member States and the EU institutions to endorse the measures needed in order to create a suitable social and political environment for implementing Roma inclusion measures, for example by supporting public education campaigns to increase the tolerance of the non-Roma population towards Roma culture and integration, both in their country of citizenship and in their country of European residence; 6. Welcomes the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council's conclusions on the Inclusion of the Roma adopted in Luxembourg on 8 June 2009, which incorporate the Common Basic Principles on Roma Inclusion and invite the Commission and the Member States to take account of them ‘when designing and implementing policies to defend fundamental rights, uphold gender equality, combat discrimination, poverty and social exclusion, and ensure access to education, housing, health, employment, social services, justice, sports and culture, and also in the EU's relations with third countries’; welcomes the request to the Commission to ‘undertake concrete steps to make Community instruments and policies relevant for Roma inclusion more effective’; 7. Expresses deep concern that, in view of the urgency of the matter, the Commission has thus far not responded to its request of 31 January 2008 to prepare a European Strategy on the Roma, in cooperation with the Member States, with the aim of better coordinating and promoting efforts to improve the situation of the Roma population; 8. Hence, calls once again on the Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe; 9. Looks forward to the Commission's communication, to be presented after the next European Roma Summit, which will examine the existing policies and instruments to improve Roma inclusion and the factors behind the unsatisfactory progress to date; calls for the communication to include clear objectives and mechanisms for the future drafting of policy on Roma; 10. Calls on the new Commissioners to prioritise Roma-related issues covered by their portfolios, while establishing as a priority an effective system of coordination between themselves and between directorates-general to tackle Roma issues at EU level; calls on the Commission to designate one of its Commissioners as responsible for coordinating Roma policy; 11. Encourages the EU institutions to involve Roma communities, from grassroots level up to international NGOs, in the process of developing a comprehensive EU Roma policy, including in all aspects of planning, implementation and supervision, and to draw on the experiences of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015, the OSCE Action Plan, and the recommendations of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and Parliament itself; calls for the mobilisation of the Roma community so that inclusion policies can be implemented jointly, as they can be successful only if all parties involved fully participate
