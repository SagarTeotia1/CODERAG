MEPs have so far heard evidence from British, Irish and German policyholders' representatives, the CEO of Equitable Life and the UK and Irish regulatory bodies. The House will vote on the committee's interim report, which requests a 3-month extension to its one-year mandate to enable it to take account of a report by the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman which is due for publication in November.

The own-initiative report, drafted by Marie-Marie-Arlette CARLOTTI (PES, FR) for the Development Committee, seeks to influence the EU’s cooperation and development policy with the aim of maximising the benefit of migration for all parties. At the beginning of the 21st century, there are 175 million migrants in the world (3% of the world population). This figure has virtually tripled in 40 years. Forty per cent of migrants live in developing countries. Migrants' remittances Remittances are the second most important source of external finance for developing countries and up to 20% of their total value is consumed by handling charges. The report calls for measures to ease the transfer of migrants’ funds, improve their access to financial services and channel their funds towards productive investment in their home countries. Making the most of migrants' skills The practice of "circular migration" or " commuting " between host countries and countries of origin can be beneficial to both sides. The report calls for programmes " to involve skilled people in the diasporas in the process of development by covering the costs of wage differentials for highly skilled migrants prepared to return to their countries or by setting up ‘dual post’ systems for public sector personnel in southern countries (teachers, researchers and doctors) ". The committee welcomes measures proposed by the European Commission
