Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (10 March 2010) The Commission is well aware of the charges brought against Mr Monjeza and Mr Chimbalanga. The Commission together with the EU Heads of Mission is currently seeking clarification from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the charges against the two men. Malawi is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). According to Article 26 of the ICCPR, ‘All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status’. The Commission together with the EU Heads of Mission will continue to follow closely the situation and raise the issue in its contacts with the government of Malawi. In this context it will also press for coherence between the national penal code and the country's international obligations.
