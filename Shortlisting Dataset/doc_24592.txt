WRITTEN QUESTION P-5808/07 by Elizabeth Lynne (ALDE) to the Commission (21 November 2007) Subject: DNA database Is the Commission aware that almost 150 000 children’s DNA records are currently held on the UK Government’s database and will be held for life, yet many of the children will have never been found guilty of any crime? Does the Commission find this to be a proportionate use of DNA recording technology and could it clarify if there is any EU legislation which this may contravene?
