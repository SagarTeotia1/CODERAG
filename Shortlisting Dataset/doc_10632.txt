WRITTEN QUESTION E-2836/08 by Claude Moraes (PSE) to the Commission (23 May 2008) Subject: Electrosensitivity Through constituents it has come to my attention that an increasing number of people find that they are adversely affected by electricity and pulsed microwave radiation in their surroundings (a condition also known as electrosensitivity). Electrosensitivity sometimes forces affected individuals to relocate to areas where they are less exposed to electricity/pulsed microwave radiation and sometimes to lose their jobs as a result. Even though some studies question the causal relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields and symptom formation, others suggest that there is in fact a complex interplay of neurophysiological and cognitive alterations contributing to symptom manifestation in electromagnetically hypersensitive patients. In the light of this, what steps is the Commission taking to undertake further research into electrosensitivity in order better to understand the phenomenon and to be able to determine ways of finding solutions for affected individuals (such as, for instance, by setting up areas free from pulsed microwaves, etc)?
