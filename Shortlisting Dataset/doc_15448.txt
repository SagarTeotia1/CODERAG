Question for written answer E-004436/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Charalampos Angourakis (GUE/NGL) (10 May 2011) Subject: Demonstrations against the construction of nuclear reactors in India Serious incidents took place on 19 April in the region of Jaitapur in Maharashtra State in India, involving residents protesting against the forced expropriation of their land and the establishment of a nuclear power plant in an earthquake zone. Unrestrained police violence resulted in one demonstrator being killed and dozens being wounded. As the (Marxist) Communist Party of India and local organisations complain, plans are afoot for the French company AREVA to build a nuclear reactor based on European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) technology, about whose reliability and safety there are serious doubts. The reactions of residents, especially after the recent disaster in Fukushima, have led to the temporary suspension of work on the project. In view of the above, will the Commission say: Does it agree about the increased risk of constructing nuclear reactors in earthquake zones and does it have any information about the safety and reliability of EPR technology? Does it condemn police violence against farmers in the region of Jaitapur who are fighting for the immediate cancellation of plans to construct a nuclear reactor? What initiatives will it take in order to avoid any further nuclear disasters, such as that in Fukushima, due to the construction of nuclear reactors of questionable reliability in earthquake-prone areas?
