local food production and food security; stresses in particular the need to support foreign direct investment and promote research and development; 4. Urges the Commission to strengthen its role in the UfM project and calls for greater clarity regarding its participation in the new institutional structure; 5. Welcomes the selection of six main strategic projects: the de-pollution of the sea, the solar energy plan, transport, education and research, SMEs and business development and civil protection, and hopes that these major projects will receive adequate support from European and international financial institutions; considers that the new UfM projects should endeavour to involve as many Euro-Mediterranean partners as possible; 6. Acknowledges the administrative and operational contribution that the new secretariat will be able to make to the UfM’s work in pursuing Euro-Mediterranean priorities and objectives, on the basis of adequate, specified resources; 7. Stresses the vital need to develop South-South trade, which accounts for just 6% of world trade, and thus to take action to extend the Agadir Agreement; draws attention to the interest these countries have in stepping up their relations and their trade so that they form a united, strong economic area which is attractive to investors and capable of defending the region's interests and boosting its development; emphasises that the UfM must make it easier to respond to requests for technical and financial assistance with a view to promoting South-South economic integration; considers that extension and simplification of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin might help in this regard; 8. Takes the view that enhancing port and land transport infrastructure may help to promote economic growth and trade between Euro-Mediterranean countries; 9. Hopes for an improvement in the economic and legal environment in the region, an essential guarantee for the security of future investment, in particular as regards foreign direct investment (FDI), which remains very weak, and to encourage funding for major strategic projects; calls, further, for greater harmonisation in this area, given the wide variations between one country and another; 10. Hopes for an improvement in the economic and legal environment in the region, an essential guarantee for future investment; insists on the objective of favouring the development of human resources and employment in line with the Millennium Development Goals for fighting poverty; underlines that the preservation and the development of strong public services is another important precondition to guarantee sustainable development in the region; 11. Stresses the importance of the role of and dialogue between businesses on both shores of the Mediterranean in boosting trade and investment; 12. Calls on the Commission to take account in trade negotiations of the results of existing impact assessments and to assess the effects of the liberalisation process, in the light of climate change and the economic and social crisis, and to enable this to be applied gradually and asymmetrically, as necessary, while protecting comparable production sectors on both shores of the Mediterranean, which are more likely to face competition as a result of greater liberalisation; calls on the UfM to select projects mainly according to social and economic and environmental mitigation
