Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (12 November 2010) The Working Time Directive Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, OJ L 299, 18.11.2003. applies to the working time of airport security personnel. It sets limits to weekly working time, and requires minimum rest breaks and daily and weekly rest periods. As regards training, Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 of 4 March 2010 laying down detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security, OJ L 55, 5.3.2010. includes detailed measures on recruitment and training of security personnel in the field of aviation security. There is also a social dialogue at EU level for the private security sector between the Confederation of European Security Services (CoESS), representing the employers, and UNI-Europa, representing the trade unions. In July 2003 they agreed a Code of Conduct, which sets out common principles on training, working conditions and health and safety in this sector http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/dsw/public/actRetrieveText.do?id=9979 . The sectoral social partners at EU level also recently published a joint website www.mobility-privatesecurity.org , which provides key information on working conditions, employment rights and applicable collective agreements for the private security sector in each Member State.
