used its political dialogue with Pakistan to raise human rights issues, and there have been a number of diplomatic demarches. This has been complemented from 2007 onwards with the human rights dialogue under the cooperation agreement with Pakistan, which allows for regular and two-way dialogue on governance and human rights. The EU has insisted that individual and minority rights be respected. The last meeting of the EU‑Pakistan Joint Commission took place on 25 March 2010, preceded by a sub-group on governance, human rights and migration on 24 March 2010. The issue of freedom of religion and rights of minorities were discussed on that occasion. The EU has also raised the issue at the Summit with Pakistan on 4 June 2010. Further to this the EU statement at the 14th Human Rights Council in Geneva (31 May‑18 June 2010) also explicitly referred to the situation of minorities in Pakistan. The European Union will continue to closely follow developments in the Asia Bibi case.
