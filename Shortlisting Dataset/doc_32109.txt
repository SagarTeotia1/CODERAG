It is also up to each credit institution to assess adequately the credit worthiness of the foreign clients in line with the current financial and regulatory framework. It has to be noted, that a comparison of interest rates across Member States in the euro-area is not a straightforward exercise and should take into account a large number of factors. Some of these differences may result from classification or other methodological issues, while a number of other factors may also play an important role. These include, in addition to institutional factors (e.g. regulation and taxation), differences in credit risk and market structure. Another likely explanation would be that Greek government's funding rates, which still represent some kind of ‘local benchmark’ for borrowers and investors in Greece, have increased more significantly for Greece than for other sovereign borrowers. It is important to take these factors into account when making cross-country comparisons of monetary financial institution (MFI) interest rates.
