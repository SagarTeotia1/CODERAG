Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (10 October 2011) The Honourable Member is requested to refer to the Commission's reply to Question E‑2662/2010 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . The European Court of Auditors Special Report ‘The European Commission’s management of pre-accession assistance to Turkey’ scrutinised the management of the Turkish Pre-Accession Instrument between 2002 and 2006. The Court recognised that since the introduction of the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) the Commission has improved the rules and procedures for selecting and monitoring EU-funded projects. To mention some measures taken recently: — the previous practice of project-based programming has been complemented with a more sectoral approach where appropriate, with sector strategies aiming at both improved ownership and impact; — the Commission has ensured that new projects have clearer objectives that result in more efficiency through more relevant and measurable indicators and benchmarks; — a comprehensive reform of the monitoring system was approved jointly by the Commission and Turkey in July 2011 to increase the focus on results and impact of projects under implementation. This includes a reorganisation of monitoring at all levels and improved reporting and follow-up mechanisms. One example is the Results Oriented Monitoring (ROM) where a team of external experts is assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of IPA projects in Turkey, while at the same time assisting the Turkish authorities to improve their own monitoring capacities. In addition, the EU Delegation to Turkey conducts complementary project monitoring activities as necessary.
