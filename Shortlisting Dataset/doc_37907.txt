WRITTEN QUESTION E-0889/07 by Antonio López-Istúriz White (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 February 2007) Subject: Education and health funding allocations by the Spanish Government for the Balearic Islands based on the 1999 population figures for The Balearic Islands are currently faced with financial difficulties in meeting their education and health spending needs, thanks to the increase in their population over the last five years. This increase has been in the region of 25 %, and the islands' schools now have pupils of 125 nationalities, while it has been necessary to increase the number of teachers by 47 %. The financing received by the Balearic Islands from the central government is not sufficient; the Spanish Government bases its contribution for the islands on the 1999 census, which it uses as a basis for allocating funds to the regions. It is clear that this financing is inadequate for the current demographic realities of the Balearic Islands, and that the regional government is therefore faced with serious underfunding as regards its present educational and health expenditure. The regional government believes that the most recent census for the islands, that of 2006, which reflects the real situation, should serve as the basis for allocations under the general system of regional funding, and not that of 1999 which is still being used by the central government. Does the Commission believe that the Spanish Government should, as a matter of urgency, update its use of censuses as the basis for its financial allocations, thus ensuring that the funding is in line with the real expenditure being incurred in the education and health sectors by the regional government of the Balearic Islands?
