Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (20 March 2007) Council Directive 91/439/EEC Council Directive 91/439/EEC of 29 July 1991 on driving licences, OJ L 237, 24.8.1991. and Directive 2006/126/EC Directive 2006/126/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on driving licences, OJ L 403, 30.12.2006. , the latest applicable from 19 January 2013, both stipulate that driving licences shall be issued only to those applicants who have passed a test of skills and behaviour and a theoretical test and who meet medical standards, in accordance with the provisions of Annexes II and III of the directive. Annex III of the directives lays down minimum standards of physical and mental fitness for driving a power-driven vehicle. Its purpose is to ensure that drivers with a medical condition can be assessed in a proper way. The main objective is to allow affected citizens to continue to enjoy mobility and to drive provided they can do it safely for themselves and the other road users. When proposing any new implementing legislation, the Commission will ensure widespread prior consultation in line with applicable consultation standards and regulatory requirements.
