WRITTEN QUESTION E-2857/10 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (29 April 2010) Subject: Vatican's stigmatisation of homosexuality Speaking at a press conference during his visit to Santiago de Chile, Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican Secretary of State, said: ‘Many psychologists and psychiatrists have demonstrated that there is no relationship between celibacy and paedophilia. But many others have demonstrated, I have been told recently, that there is a relationship between homosexuality and paedophilia.’ These statements, which are both wrong and profoundly irresponsible, represent an intolerable contribution to the stigmatisation of homosexuality. People bearing public and spiritual responsibility for some sections of the world population need to be extremely careful when making statements such as the one quoted above, defaming a group which in no way deserves to be linked to an abominable crime such as pederasty. What is the Commission's assessment of this allegedly scientific link between homosexuality and paedophilia? Has the Commission in any way expressed its unease to the Vatican at this attempt to link a sexual choice to a serious crime such as paedophilia?
