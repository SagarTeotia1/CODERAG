Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (24 November 2010) The European Social Fund (ESF) is the Union’s main financial instrument for investing in employment, human capital and social inclusion. Throughout the Union the ESF supports action to enhance human capital Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Social Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1784/1999, OJ L 210, 31.7.2006. . In the Convergence regions (those with a GDP per capita of less than 75 % of the EU‑25 average), the ESF also supports action to expand and improve investment in human capital, in particular by promoting greater participation in education and training throughout life, including through greater access to tertiary education and training Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006. . As the Honourable Member knows, the ESF is subject to shared management by the Commission, the Member States and the regions, which draw up their own operational programmes. The scope of the latter has to be consistent with the priorities in the Member States’ national reform programmes. Whether or not training to be a pilot qualifies for ESF support will therefore depend on the ESF operational programme of the potential beneficiary’s Member State or region Information on operational programmes and the contact details of the ESF managing authorities is available at http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/esf/members/index_en.htm .
