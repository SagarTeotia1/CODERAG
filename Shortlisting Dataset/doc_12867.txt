WRITTEN QUESTION E-2746/10 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (22 April 2010) Subject: Promoting Erasmus in the UK The Erasmus programme is the European Union’s flagship educational exchange programme and is one of its finest achievements. Every year, thousands of students from across Europe gain invaluable experience, inter-cultural understanding and broaden their academic and work opportunities. However, the UK still has one of the lowest participation rates in the Erasmus programme when it comes to study exchanges. It has been suggested that this is not because the scheme is unpopular in Britain, but that not enough time and resources are dedicated to promoting it. What is the Commission doing to improve the promotion of the Erasmus programme in the UK and increase the number of British students participating? What steps has the Commission taken to encourage UK national authorities to increase awareness amongst students?
