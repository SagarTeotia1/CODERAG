" as of 30 June 2001 there were 70.000 individual with-profits policyholders with GARs, 415.000 individual policyholders without GARs, 105.000 GAR and 510.000 non-GAR policyholders in group pension schemes ". . The scheme was meant to stabilize the with-profits fund by reducing exposure to GARs, while at the same time eliminate the risk of legal action against EL for mis-selling, claiming the potential risks of GAR liabilities had not been disclosed to them when taking out their policies. As stated in WE80, the Irish Regulatory authorities were not involved in the Compromise Scheme agreement process. The terms of the Compromise were that “ all and any GAR-Related Claims that each Scheme Policyholder has and/or may have in relation to their GAR Fund and/or Non-GAR Fund ... shall be waived and settled fully, finally and irrevocably ”, excluding explicitly “ any complaint or claim to any ombudsman (including the Financial Ombudsman Service )”. 3a) Timeline surrounding the 'Compromise Scheme' 20 July 2000 : House of Lords ruling , upholding the Appeal Court's ruling, declared unlawful the payout of differential bonus levels on GAR policies (thus forcing EL to put itself up for sale) July-Nov. 2000 : Several companies considered a take-over of Equitable Life, but no bids materialize WE58 explains how "Equitable's approach to cost controls and operating efficiency... meant that it was always going to be peculiarly unattractive to a prospective purchaser (even leaving aside problems with guaranteed annuities) for the simple reason that it had become so efficient and lean that there would be only very slim profits to be generated for a shareholder were the Society ever to de-mutualise".
