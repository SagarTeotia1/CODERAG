Question for written answer E-001469/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Marina Yannakoudakis (ECR) (14 February 2012) Subject: EU internal market rules on the free movement of goods I have been contacted by one of my London constituents, who has asked whether there are EU internal market rules on the free movement of goods that prevent small quantities of alcohol and tobacco being sent in the post across EU borders as gifts to family members and friends. The courier company that my constituent works for has informed my constituent that it would need a licence to send such products. Could the Commission clarify what quantity of alcohol and tobacco can be sent across EU borders, both via courier and in the post, and whether any such licence is required?
