WRITTEN QUESTION E-4870/06 by Elena Valenciano Martínez-Orozco (PSE) to the Commission (15 November 2006) Subject: Rights of indigenous peoples in Ecuador The Ibero-American Court of Human Rights, and the UN Rapporteur for Indigenous Peoples, Mr Rodolfo Stavenhagen, have on several occasions spoken out on behalf of the rights of the indigenous people of Sarayaku, in the Ecuadorian Amazon region, with regard to their struggle to preserve and manage their natural territory. The conflict with the oil companies — with whom the Ecuadorian Government has signed contracts involving the exploitation of rather more than 65 % of the territory which is the property of this indigenous people, without any provision of information, organising of consultations or obtaining of consent — has given rise to a chain of violations and abuses of fundamental human rights involving various leaders of the Kichwa people of Sarayaku. The Human Rights Council’s adoption in June 2006 of the draft United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples represents a major boost for promoting and defending the rights of indigenous peoples throughout the world. Is the Commission aware of the conflict between the oil companies and the Kichwa people of Sarayaku? What position are the EU and the Commission taking at the meeting of the 61st Sitting of the UN General Assembly in order to secure the definitive adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples?
