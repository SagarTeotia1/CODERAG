In Europe, the numbers of newly diagnosed infections are increasing throughout the 25 EU Member States, with the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain seeing the highest rates of new HIV infections (EuroHIV, 2007). This is in spite of figures released in 2007 by UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, which states that on a global scale the number of people living with HIV has reduced from nearly 40 million in 2006 to around 33 million. Early Diagnosis and Early Care The focus of the Council and Commission statements will be on timely diagnosis and treatment for HIV/AIDS. Both HIV infection and AIDS cannot be cured, but they can be treated. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of three or four drugs which inhibit the production of virus, significantly prolongs the lives of AIDS patients and is generally available. However, resistance to these drugs is a problem (EUPHIX). In terms of prevention, there is currently no effective vaccine to prevent transmission of HIV. According to EUPHIX, an EU public health information system, several candidate vaccines are in development and tested in clinical trials, but so far results have been disappointing. Most European countries have reduced the rate of HIV transmission in medical settings (through blood screening and universal precautions) and from mother to child (through routine screening, use of preventive drugs, preventive measures during the delivery, and advising mothers who are infected not to breastfeed). Current EU activities in tackling and preventing HIV/AIDS The HIV/AIDS epidemic has been an important focus of concern and action of the European Union's public health activities since the late 1980's. The EU funds research projects, has established networks to facilitate cooperation and the exchange of information between the Member States, Candidate and EEA countries (Lichtenstein, Iceland and Norway), and has taken action to address specific challenges facing vulnerable groups such as migrants, drug users or sex workers (Health-EU). The EU has also been active in developing countries and at global level, providing 55 percent of the funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM). However, in light of the latest wave of the HIV epidemic, measures and action already being taken will have to be reinforced.
