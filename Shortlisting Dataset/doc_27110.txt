WRITTEN QUESTION E-1203/08 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (5 March 2008) Subject: Ireland's transposition of the directive on the safety of third country aircraft using European airports In answering my Written Question E‑1904/07 on 12 June 2007, the Commission said that Ireland had recently notified it of a draft of the statutory instrument to transpose Directive 2004/36/EC OJ L 143, 30.4.2004, p. 76. on the safety of third country aircraft using Community airports into Irish law, as required by 30 April 2006, and informed it of the imminent adoption of the necessary legislation. Why did the Commission decide, as per its statement of 27 June (IP/07/940), to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for not having communicated its national legislation transposing this directive?
