WRITTEN QUESTION E-3364/09 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (5 May 2009) Subject: Undergrounding new power lines In recent years, there have been significant developments in a number of EU Member States on the question of undergrounding new 400KV electrical cables. Independent reviews carried out in Ireland (Ecofys) and in Germany (The Askon Report) have found that undergrounding has a number of important advantages in terms of reliability, health and the environment over using pylons. In Germany, federal level legislation has been proposed to require transmission operators to carry out technical and economic considerations for underground lines which pass within 200 metres of individual homes and 400 metres of residential areas. Last year, Mario Monti, the EU coordinator for the electrical interconnector between Spain and France recommended that part of this line should be undergrounded. These recommendations were then passed by the Franco-Spanish Summit in June 2008 and the competent authorities and electricity grid companies have now been called upon to implement these plans with immediate effect. 1. In light of these developments, does the Commission intend to recommend that all Member States should consider the benefits of undergrounding new power lines? 2. Has the Commission undertaken any research or studies on the benefits of undergrounding new power lines?
