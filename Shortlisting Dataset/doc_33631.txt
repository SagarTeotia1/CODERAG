2004/C 51 E/063 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1011/03 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (27 March 2003) Subject: Use of funds from the Daphne programme by the municipality of Pesaro In September 2002, the monitoring committee of the Italian Ministry for Economic Affairs issued a report on the spending of EU funds. The report reveals the alarming slowness and inefficiency with which EU funds are allocated to projects by some regional authorities. The grave concerns about the inadequate use of European funds by local authorities have frequently been echoed by the Commission. Bearing in mind that some local authorities, such as the municipality of Pesaro, urgently need to use European funds to combat the abuse of women and children, can the Commission state: 1. whether the municipality of Pesaro has submitted projects for the Daphne programme? 2. whether the municipality of Pesaro has secured funding for these projects? 3. whether this funding has been used?
