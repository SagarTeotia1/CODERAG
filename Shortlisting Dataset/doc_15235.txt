Question for written answer E-004037/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (4 May 2011) Subject: People trafficking Scores of young people with disabilities or mental problems have experienced horrifying moments at the hands of members of an inhuman ring of people traffickers who forced them into begging. Following an investigation by the Attica Security Department's Section for Combating People Trafficking working together with the Bulgarian authorities, a pair of Bulgarians who had been trafficking in people were arrested (a 30-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman). They had tracked down individuals in Bulgaria with disabilities or severe mental problems who were in straightened circumstances and, with the promise of legitimate work, brought them to Greece, and in particular Athens. I ask the Commission: Since people trafficking is a serious problem, what action has it taken to protect victims?
