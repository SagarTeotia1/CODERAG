WRITTEN QUESTION E-0198/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (26 January 2009) Subject: Purchase of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus by Ryanair It has been reported in recent weeks that the airline Ryanair has made an offer of 740 million euros to acquire the remaining 70.18 % stake in Aer Lingus, Ireland's leading airline. Michael O'Leary's airline already holds 29.82 % of the company's shares and is seeking to acquire full ownership of the Irish flag carrier. However, Aer Lingus has rejected the offer as ridiculous and even offensive, with company chairman John Sharman considering Ryaniar's proposal (EUR 1.40 per share) to be far too low. In this connection, it should be borne in mind that Ryanair had already tried to acquire Aer Lingus in 2006 without being given the green light by the Commission. Furthermore, Ryanair's current offer is much lower than the 2006 one (EUR 2.80 per share), as a result of the economic downturn, as well as statements by Aer Lingus chiefs anticipating substantial financial losses in 2009, In the light of the above, does the Commission not think it should keep a close eye on any potential mergers between Aer Lingus and Ryanair? What measures does it plan to take?
