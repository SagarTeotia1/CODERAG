Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (17 January 2011) The Commission is aware of the Council conclusions on the welfare of dogs and cats as mentioned by the Honourable Member. The Commission is presently considering a possible follow-up to the first EU Action Plan on Animal Welfare. To prepare this strategy the Commission mandated an evaluation that included the welfare of pet animals. In the light of the results of the study, consideration would be given to possible future actions in the field of welfare of dogs and cats taking into account the principle of subsidiarity and including those actions indicated by the Council on 29 November 2010. At present there is no EU rule governing this matter and as a consequence it remains under the sole responsibility of the Member States and of Spain in the case of Galgo greyhounds.
