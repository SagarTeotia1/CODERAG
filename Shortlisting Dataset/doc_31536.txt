WRITTEN QUESTION E-5860/09 by Louis Michel (ALDE) to the Commission (30 November 2009) Subject: Methods of deducting VAT Does the Commission consider that a provision such as Article 15(4) of the German ‘Umsatzsteuergesetz’ (law on turnover tax) of 1999, which allows the amount of VAT which may be deducted to be calculated on the basis of any ‘reasonable means’, accords with the principle of non-discrimination? Does the Commission agree that the principle of non-discrimination in the application of VAT means that taxable persons should not be treated differently in respect of the tax imposed on similar — and competing — goods and services? If so, how does the Commission reconcile that principle with the variety of methods of deducting VAT allowed under Article 173 of Directive 2006/112/EC OJ L 347, 11.12.2006, p. 1 . ? Is it the case that a report drawn up by the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation at the Commission's request in December 2006 revealed just such a variety of complex methods used for calculating taxable persons' entitlement to VAT deduction, and that the report contained inaccuracies even after it had been revised by the Commission and the national administrative authorities?
