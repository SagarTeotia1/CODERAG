EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Scope of the new directive According to the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) the current Regulation (EC) 1698/2005 (as one of the first proposals) has to be aligned based on the principle of sorting between measures of implementing nature and measures of delegated nature - of the current Commission implementing powers which were adopted on the basis of Regulations (EC) No 1974/2006 and No 1975/2006.
