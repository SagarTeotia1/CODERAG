Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (1 August 2011) The Commission considers it a priority to consult all stakeholders, including social stakeholders. The main consultation with stakeholders was undertaken in the framework of the reform of the CFP, which started with the adoption of the Green Paper in April 2009. The Green Paper was the basis for a public consultation which lasted until 31 December 2010. In addition to the public consultation, around 200 meetings with Member States, Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA) and Regional Advisory Councils (RACs), the fishing industry, the processing and marketing sector, trade unions, NGOs, and the research community were organised. A number of meetings took also place in 2010 and 2011, during which concrete options for the CFP reform, including its financial dimension, were presented by the Commission and discussed with the stakeholders. In total, around 250 meetings have been organised to get stakeholders views and to prepare the reform process. The results of the consultations on the CFP reform are published on DG MARE's website and are summarised in a Commission's Staff Working Document ‘Synthesis of the Consultation on the Reform of the common fisheries policy’ 6, included in Annex A. In line with the Commission guidelines on Impact Assessment, in the consultation process all affected stakeholders were engaged and could comment on CFP reform scenarios, including the social partners. The stakeholder's contributions were reflected in the impact assessment report and taken into the account in the preparation of the proposal.
