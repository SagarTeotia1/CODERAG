WRITTEN QUESTION E-6566/08 by Georgios Georgiou (IND/DEM) to the Commission (11 December 2008) Subject: Infrastructures in Greece Greece has 3 500 islands and islets, of which 228 are inhabited. Each island needs separate infrastructures (airport, one or more sea ports, desalination plant, sufficient energy supplies with separate installations, roads, schools, drainage, etc.). Furthermore, Greece is the most mountainous of the EU Member States. From the 1990s up to the present, has Greece been seeking the introduction of a major Community funding instrument — aside from the CSFs received by other EU Member States also — in order to bring its level of development rapidly into line with that of the rest of the EU? Is such an initiative excluded under EU legislation?
