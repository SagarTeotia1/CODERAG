Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (2 February 2011) It has to be decided at Member States' level in which cases a legitimate employment policy might justify differentiations on grounds of age. The same holds true for the other questions of the Honourable Member. The Commission only monitors the complete and correct transposition of the directive. In cases of doubt whether a national law or practice is compatible with EU law, a national court could refer the question to the Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ). The ECJ is the competent institution to interpret EC law. Recent judgments of the ECJ in the area of age discrimination are for instance: Rosenbladt , C-45/09; Deutsche Lufthansa , C-109/09, and Prigge , C-447/09. In case Rosenbladt (paragraph 41), the ECJ held that ‘the Member States and, where appropriate, the social partners at national level enjoy broad discretion in their choice, not only to pursue a particular aim in the field of social and employment policy, but also in the definition of measures capable of achieving it’ . In the same judgment, the ECJ explains furthermore that ‘when the Member States implement the directive, they are not obliged to draw up a specific list of differences in treatment which may be justified by a legitimate aim. If, in the exercise of their discretion, they decide to do so, they may include in that list examples of differences in treatment and aims other than those expressly covered by the directive, provided that those aims are legitimate within the meaning of Article 6(1) thereof and are appropriate and necessary to achieve those aims’ .
