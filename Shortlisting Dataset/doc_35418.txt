Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (28 September 2004) 1. In the implementation of Decision No 20/2004/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 8 December 2003 establishing a general framework for financing Community actions in support of consumer policy for the years 2004 to 2007, no funding is allocated to Italy, nor to any other Member State, nor for that matter to any local authority. The budget execution is centralised and not based on the allocation of budgetary quotas to national entities. Budget implementation follows the rules set out in the Financial Regulation Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, OJ L 357, 31.12.2002 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. Essentially, this means the budget is executed through calls for tender and calls for proposals, in compliance with the principles of transparency, sound financial management and non-discrimination of the Financial Regulation. 2. As stipulated in Article 11 of Decision 20/2004/EC, the Commission adopts each year a work programme for its implementation. The 2004 work programme was adopted on 31 March 2004. It was subject to a prior consultation with the Member States representatives in the Advisory Committee as foreseen in Articles 14 and 15 of the Decision. The Report on the written consultation of the Member States Advisory Committee on the 2004 work programme was communicated to the Parliament on 22 April 2004 and made available in the public registry of documents. The 2004 work programme as adopted was also published on the website of Directorate Health and Consumer Protection: http://europa.eu.int/comm/consumers/overview/fina_framework_en.htm . As indicated in the work programme, for 2004 € 2.5 million of the total budget of € 20.2 million (excluding European Free Trade Association (EFTA) contribution) is dedicated to a call for proposals for specific projects. This call was launched on 30 April 2004, the deadline for submissions was 13 July 2004 and the decision on the approval of projects proposals is due by 13 October 2004. No projects have therefore been approved yet. 3. Since Decision 20/2004/CE entered into force in January 2004 and the first call for projects is still under way, there are no projects already implemented or funding for specific projects already obtained under Decision 20/2004/EC.
