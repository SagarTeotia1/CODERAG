Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (10 February 2005) The Prospective Study that the Commission is expected to provide on the basis of Article 7.3 of Directive 97/67/EC Directive 97/67/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 1997 on common rules for the development of the internal market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service, OJ L 15, 21.1.1998 , as amended, is part of the preparatory work for the report and the proposal to the Parliament and the Council that should confirm, if appropriate, the date of 2009 for the full accomplishment of the internal postal market, or determine any other step in the light of the study’s conclusions. The preparatory work for these initiatives, which are due in 2006, will soon be started. The Commission intends to ensure the widest possible consultation of stakeholders in this preparatory phase, including the Parliament and the other EU Institutions, Member States, individual and business users, public and private operators, representatives of employees and employers, postal related industry, regulatory bodies and associations representing any of these groups, where all relevant issues should be raised. In particular, with regard to the preparation of the Prospective Study, the Commission will require the assistance of an external consultant for the necessary research and analysis. The call for tenders for the contract is expected to be published in due course with a view to having the contract signed later in 2005. While the consultation of the stakeholders will be an important task of the contractor, the Commission envisages launching a wide public consultation in the last months of 2005.
