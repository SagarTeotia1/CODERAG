Reply (16 March 2009) In response to the current Gaza crisis the Council of 26 January 2009 concluded that the European Union will focus its support and assistance on the following areas: immediate humanitarian relief for the population of Gaza, prevention of illicit trafficking in arms and ammunition, sustained re-opening of crossing points on the basis of the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access, rehabilitation and reconstruction and the resumption of the peace process. The possible mobilisation of an EU military force to which the Honourable Member of the European Parliament refers in his question is not included in the abovementioned areas of support and assistance. However, in its conclusions of 26 January 2009, the Council expressed the EU's readiness to reactivate the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM Rafah) — which is a civilian mission — as soon as conditions allow, and to examine the possibility of extending its assistance to other crossing points as part of the overall EU engagement in the region.
