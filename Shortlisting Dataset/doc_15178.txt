authentication of the two parties and of the validity of the documents served on a case-by-case basis. The role currently fulfilled by the addressee agency informing the addressee of his/her rights would have to be fulfilled in another way. In the context of the work on European e-Justice, the question of cross-border service of documents could be considered further in future years. In general, more work needs to be done to achieve electronic transmissions of judicial and extrajudicial documents. Results of current studies and pilot projects financed by the Commission regarding e-Identity and e-Signature will also have to be taken into consideration. 2. Directive 95/46/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data OJ L 281, 23.11.1995. (‘Data Protection Directive’) is technology neutral. Therefore, if personal data are processed by way of creating a user's account with an online social network operator, the principles enshrined in the Data Protection Directive will be applicable. In particular account owners should have the ability to decide what kind of data they will publish about themselves on an online social network, given that this is a voluntary activity and the processing by the social network operator is justified on the basis of the free and informed consent of the individual. It should also be up to account holders to decide whether they make their account accessible to anyone in an unrestricted manner or whether they choose to restrict access to account information to, say, well-defined groups of friends, family, colleagues or other ‘closed’ groups.
