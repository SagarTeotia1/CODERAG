Reply (19 January 2009) The idea of setting up a European coastguard was put forward by the European Parliament and the Council in Article 11 of Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 14. . In that directive the Commission was asked to submit a feasibility study on a European coastguard dedicated to pollution prevention and response. That study has not so far been submitted. The question of whether a European coastguard should be set up is also one of the issues raised in the Commission Green Paper of June 2006 on an EU maritime policy Commission Green Paper of 7.6.2006 ‘Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union: A European Vision for the Oceans and Seas’ — COM(2006)275 final. . As regards border controls and combating illegal immigration, the Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union OJ C 53, 3.3.2005, p. 1. , approved by the European Council at its meeting on 5 November 2004, raises the possibility of creating a ‘European system of border guards’. This idea was taken up in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 13440/08. , adopted by the European Council on 15 and 16 October 2008, which states that ultimately the setting up of such a system may be examined. It should be noted that Article 62, point (2)(a) of the EC Treaty limits Community competence to the adoption of standards and procedures to be followed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at external borders, which implies that responsibility for carrying out such checks lies with the Member States. To date, no Commission proposal, either on the setting up of a European coastguard or on a European system of border guards, has been received by the Council.
