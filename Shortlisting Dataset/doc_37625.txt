Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (14 November 2011) 1. Automatic recognition only applies to those qualifications listed in Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC. Since paediatric cardiology currently is not listed in Annex, V, point 5.1.3 of Directive 2005/36/EC, holders of this qualification cannot benefit from automatic recognition in other Member States. 2. When a qualification, such as paediatric cardiology, is not listed in Annex V, it can nevertheless benefit from recognition under the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications. In such cases, the host Member State — the UK in this case — must compare the applicant's training with the national training requirements. In case of substantial differences between the core training for the specialisation in the home Member State of such professional, and in the host Member State, the host Member State may impose compensatory measures upon the applicant. 3. The Commission may include new medical specialities into Annex V only if they are common to at least two-fifths of the Member States (Art. 26(2)). Such a decision further requires the support of a qualified majority of the Member States. The Commission is currently working on a revision of Directive 2005/36/EC and considering in this context whether to revise the framework for introducing new specialities into Annex V.
