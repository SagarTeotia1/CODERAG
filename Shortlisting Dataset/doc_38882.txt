Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2012) The prevention of and fight against illicit trafficking of cultural goods is one of the priorities of an Action Plan for 2011-2013 http://www.africa-eu-partnership.org/sites/default/files/doc_jaes_action_plan_2011_13_en.pdf , currently being implemented on the basis of the EU‑Africa Strategic Partnership. Further to the 3rd EU‑Africa Summit, held on 29‑30 November 2010 in Tripoli, this plan sets out a number of initiatives to be undertaken in relation to the return of illegally exported goods and access to information on stolen goods. Museums and cultural institutions in Africa and the EU are to be involved with these plans. This is also one of the priorities identified in the ‘Strategy for the development of Euro-Mediterranean cultural heritage: priorities from Mediterranean countries (2007‑13)’. The Euromed Heritage IV programme has launched actions and workshops, and has a website in Arabic, French and English http://www.euromedheritage.net/intern.cfm?menuID=16&submenuID=20&subsubmenuID=12 . The main conclusions of the study on prevention of and fight against illicit trafficking in cultural goods were presented to three experts groups in the Council http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st15/st15235.en11.pdf . The whole study was published in December 2011 on the web pages of Directorates-General Home Affairs and Education and Culture. The issue is likely to be on the agenda of the December JHA Council, on the basis of draft conclusions drawn up by the Polish Presidency of the Council. The Work Plan for Culture 2011-2014 provides for the establishement in 2012 of an expert group to facilitate traceability of cultural goods and improve knowledge on due diligence. The Commission has not considered proposing a Regulation establishing uniform controls at import into the Union for specific categories of cultural goods. The recent Study on illicit traficking referred to above does not give any indication that there is a need for or an interest in such action.
