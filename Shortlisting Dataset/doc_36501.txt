Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (17 December 2009) The Commission would like to note that since the Honourable Member addressed this question to the Commission, the circumstances regarding the future of General Motor's Opel/Vauxhall operations have considerably changed. General Motors has decided on 3 November 2009 not to sell a majority stake in its Opel/Vauxhall operations to Magna/Sberbank but rather to implement its own restructuring plan. The Commission expects the new GM restructuring plan to be based on solid economic grounds, in order to ensure the long-term viability of Opel and sustainable jobs for Opel's workers. The Commission will verify that any financial support from Member State governments for the new GM restructuring plan will be fully compliant with EU state aid and internal market rules. The Commission has consistently taken the position that state aid granted by Member States under the Temporary Framework is meant to tackle problems due to the economic and financial crisis, and cannot be used to impose additional non-commercial conditions concerning the locations of production facilities within the EU. This is essential to avoid subsidy races between Member States and the fragmentation of the Single Market. The Commission will continue to engage in timely and thorough discussions with Member States to ensure that any financial support governments may intend to grant for the new GM restructuring plan – will comply with State aid and internal market rules.
