Question for written answer E-6950/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (9 September 2010) Subject: Rampant unemployment According to a recent survey by the IOBE (Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research), the estimate of the number of unemployed in Greece in 2010 is 600 000. Figures produced by the Statistical Office of Greece show that youth unemployment in Greece has already hit a record 32.5 %. In his recent speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Barosso stressed that the question of unemployment must be a top priority for the new Belgian Presidency. Given that the creation of new jobs requires economic growth in an economically difficult period for the Member States, will the Commission answer the following questions? 1. What specific measures will the Commission take to boost innovation and entrepreneurship in order to strengthen the EU's competitiveness? 2. How will it improve the business climate, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the businesses most badly affected by the crisis? 3. Given that youth unemployment in Greece has risen by 160 000 in twelve months because of the recession, how does the Commission intend to help young people looking for work in a tough economic environment? Is there any provision in the ‘Europe 2020’ and ‘Phare’ programmes on an industrial policy for the age of globalisation for measures to support young people in setting up businesses and finding work? Will firms be given incentives to recruit young workers?
