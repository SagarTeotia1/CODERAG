Reply (11 November 2007) The Council has repeatedly called upon Turkey to commit unequivocally to good neighbourly relations, as well as to resolve any outstanding border disputes peacefully in accordance with the United Nations Charter. These principles — recalled by the Council on 11 December 2006 — are also set out in the negotiating framework that the Council approved in October 2005, and they constitute short-term priorities in the revised accession partnership for Turkey. The EU systematically addresses these issues in the context of political dialogue meetings with Turkey, and the Council will continue to follow developments closely and revisit the issue as appropriate. It should also be recalled that good neighbourly relations and their peaceful settlement are included in the requirements against which Turkey's progress in preparing for accession will be measured.
