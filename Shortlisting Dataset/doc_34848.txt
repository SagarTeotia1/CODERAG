and improving production sustainability. As in all cases, Community assistance is demand driven, requires requests from benefiting governments and is coordinated with Member States to allow for maximum coherence and complementarity. Furthermore, the Commission's eco-labelling scheme, by way of Commission decision of 15 May 2002, established the ecological criteria for the award of the Community Eco-label to textile products and sets out the EU Eco-label criteria for cotton, including references to organic production of cotton. Consumers may access further information from the Commission's Eco-label website, which also contains a catalogue of products awarded the European Eco-label. In reference to labelling which indicates the country of origin, on 16 December 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries COM(2005)661 final. . The proposal covers those sectors which have shown interest in an origin marking, among them textiles and clothing. Since January 2006, the Commission proposal is being discussed by the Member States in the Council.
