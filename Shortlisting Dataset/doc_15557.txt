air traffic management projects can all be financed via the Fund. All these extensions of the fields of intervention are in accordance with the priorities fixed in Lisbon and Gothenburg which of course remain as the priority objectives of the current programming period, and their budgetary implications are reflected in the substantial increase to be seen in the 2007 budget Including the allocation for Bulgaria and Romania. . Ø Northern Ireland peace programme and the International Fund for Ireland : Point 49 of the Conclusions of the European Council states "The European Council takes note of the current difficulties in the peace process in Northern Ireland and supports the efforts of the two governments in seeking to re-establish the devolved institutions. In order to support these efforts, the European Council calls on the Commission to examine the possibility of aligning interventions under the PEACE II programme and the International Fund for Ireland with those of the other programmes under the Structural Funds that come to an end in 2006, including the implications in financial terms. Despite differing management authorities and procedures a considerable amount of synergy exists between actions financed under the IFI and those financed by the Peace Programme of the Union. It is particular importance for both organisations to avoid duplication of effort or double financing. In the absence of a legal base for allocating money to the IFI during the 2007 budgetary exercise, the Commission was unable to allocate budgetary resources in the PDB and has therefore the mention PM. It is however preparing the necessary texts and regulations to rectify the situation in the near future. Foreseen payments for 2007 amount to Euro 15 million, which is the amount which will be allocated annually over the whole period. Budget line 13.03.02 "completion of the special programme for peace and reconciliation in N. Ireland" has no commitments in the 2007 budget but has the mention pm. Foreseen payments from that budget line are set at Euro 50.000.000 However, in accordance with the European Council decision of December 2005 allocating Euro 200 million to the Peace programme over the 7 year period. The 2007 budget share of this is to be found in commitments to budget line 13.03.17 (Peace) Euro 30.244.428 . Foreseen payments in 2007 from this budget line are Euro 4.496.913 In summary: The combined IFI Peace 111 effort foresees for 2007 Euro 50.000.000 2006 Budget + 4.496.913 2007 Budget + 15.000.000 in payment credits (total Euro 69.496.913). Commitments to the Peace programme are at Euro 30.244.428. Euro 15.000.000 will be committed as the EU contribution to the IFI in 2007. Ø RAL: The Commission tells us that "for sub-heading 1b the overall payments budget comprises 4 components – advance payments relating to the commitments under the new financial framework; reimbursements to clear RAL for the 2000-2006 Structural Fund programmes; a residual amount to clear remaining RAL for the pre-2000 programmes; and payments for the Cohesion Fund.
