Question for written answer E-011818/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) (13 December 2011) Subject: The Arnoia dam (Portugal) The Arnoia dam, near Óbidos (Portugal), was constructed several years ago but has never been used as planned for irrigation, thanks to the failure to create the necessary channels for distributing the water. This means that some 800 farmers cannot make use of the facility. Can the Commission state: 1. whether it believes it possible to finance the creation of the planned irrigation system; 2. what would be the likely timetable for approval of a proposal from Portugal to that end?
