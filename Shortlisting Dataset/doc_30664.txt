Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (20 February 2012) The Commission with the Safer Internet Programme develops policies and funds projects to raise awareness and build knowledge about harmful content children encounter online and about implementing appropriate protection measures http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/sip/index_en.htm . The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (Directive 2010/13/EU) obliges Member States to take measures to protect minors against any content in TV programmes and on-demand audiovisual services which might impair their physical, mental or moral development Articles 12 and 27. . The Commission adopted in 2007 a communication COM(2007) 833. and in 2009 a recommendation COM(2009) 6464. on media literacy http://ec.europa.eu/culture/media/literacy/index_en.htm . In the 1998 and 2006 EU Recommendations on Protection of Minors Council recommendation of 24.9.1998 (98/560/EC) and recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20.12.2006 (2006/952/EC). Member States and industry were called upon to promote and develop appropriate framework conditions. On 13 September 2011, the Commission published a report on the application of these Recommendations http://ec.europa.eu/avpolicy/reg/minors/rec/index_en.htm . The Council followed this up by adopting Conclusions on 29 November 2011 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/homepage/showfocus?lang=en&focusID=78462 .
