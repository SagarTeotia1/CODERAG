examined seven women were appointed heads of unit. The fourth action programme for equal opportunities for women and men at the European Commission (2004‑08) was adopted on 28 April 2004 SEC(2004)447/5. and seeks primarily to improve the gender balance in the staff, remove the obstacles to career development for women and ensure overall consistency between the action of the various Commission departments. The fourth action programme gave priority to quantifiable measure that were comparable between DGs and subject to regular monitoring. An annual report reviews the implementation of the programme by the Commission departments and the progress achieved overall. The third monitoring report, which will be presented to the Commission in November 2007, will detail the commitment of the DGs and the progress achieved with the measures to remove the obstacles to women's career development (specific coaching programmes, priority given to women in cases where the candidates are of equal merit, specific encouragement for women to follow management training, etc.). The recent measures to reconcile private and working life (replacing absent staff, teleworking, flexible working hours) should also help to improve the situation. The third report will also present the results and recommendations of an external study comparing the careers of female and male AD officials at the Commission, which was completed in July 2007.
