Question for written answer E-010710/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Hans-Peter Martin (NI) (21 November 2011) Subject: Requirement for catering establishments to provide information In restaurants, fast food restaurants and snack bars customers are normally not openly informed, or are only informed at their request, of the ingredients used in the products being sold. This can have serious health implications for people suffering from allergies or food intolerances. It also makes it more difficult for people who cannot eat certain foods for religious, moral or dietary reasons to eat out. An additional page in menus or a clearly visible blackboard could, for example, be used to provide customers with information of this kind. To my knowledge, there is no EU‑wide requirement for catering establishments to provide consumers with information on the ingredients used. Does the Commission think that such rules could be introduced? Would the Commission welcome the introduction of such rules? In the Commission's view, what are the arguments for and against requiring such information to be provided?
