2004/C 65 E/052 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1186/03 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (1 April 2003) Subject: Use of funds from the FIFG by the municipality of Ancona In September 2002, the monitoring committee of the Italian Ministry for Economic Affairs issued a report on the spending of EU funds. The report reveals the alarming slowness and inefficiency with which EU funds are allocated to projects by some regional authorities. The grave concerns about the inadequate use of European funds by local authorities have frequently been echoed by the Commission. Bearing in mind that some local authorities, such as the municipality of Ancona, urgently need to use European funds to support structural measures in the sector of fisheries, acquaculture and the processing and marketing of the relevant products, can the Commission state: 1. whether the municipality of Ancona has submitted projects for the FIFG? 2. whether the municipality of Ancona has secured funding for these projects? 3. whether this funding has been used?
