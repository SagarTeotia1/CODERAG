Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2011) On 13 July 2011, the Commission published a communication on the available options for a European Terrorist Finance Tracking System COM(2011)429 final. with a view to enter into a political debate with Parliament and the Council. At this stage, the Commission has not indicated a preference for one of the different options under discussion. The advantages and disadvantages of each option can to some extent already be deduced from the issues raised in the communication and will be discussed in detail during the debates in the Council and Parliament. The impact assessment which will accompany any subsequent legislative proposal will also then look in detail at the issues of necessity and proportionality. It will also assess the impact on fundamental rights, including the protection of personal data. As concerns the discussions of the communication in Parliament and Council, the Commission is ready to engage in a discussion with Parliament and the Council at their earliest convenience. The Council Presidency has already decided to launch discussions within the Council, starting the process with a first meeting of the article Thirty-Six Committee (CATS) on 1 September 2011.
