Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (23 April 2010) The Honourable Member refers in this question to the planned construction of a new footbridge to link one of the avenues of the town of Peñíscola with the school and leisure facilities area. The Honourable Member believes that this footbridge will turn into a new street that will disturb bird nesting and deteriorate the site of Community interest (SCI). The Commission notes that the site of Community importance ‘Marjal de Peñíscola’ in Castellón, (Spain), has been designated under the provisions of the Habitats Directive Council Directive 92/43/EC, of 21 May 1992, on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora (OJ L 206, 22.7.1992). . The Commission also notes that this SCI is partially embedded in the urban area of the town of Peñíscola. According to the information included in the Standard Data Form (SDF) the site has been designated because of the presence of wetland habitats of Community interest and two fish species: ‘Valencia hispanica’ and ‘Aphanius iberus’. The SDF does neither include any birds listed on Annex I of Council Directive 2009/147/EC Council Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and codifying the Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds ( OJ L 103, 25.4.1979 ): of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds (OJ L 20/7, 26.1.2010). nor regularly occurring migratory birds not listed on Annex I of Council Directive 2009/147/EC. The Commission stresses that before authorising any plan or project likely to have a significant impact on the site, the competent authorities will need to ensure that the requirements of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive are fulfilled. According to Article 6(3) and 6(4) any plan or project that will likely have an effect on the site, must be assessed regarding its implications on the site and the site's conservation objectives. On the basis of the required assessments, the competent authorities will decide if the plan or project can be undertaken and if so, the conditions and safeguards it must observe to maintain the integrity of the site concerned. The information provided by the Honourable Member does not provide any evidence of impacts that the project of a new footbridge will pose to the conservation objectives and to the integrity of the site, suggesting a potential breach of the provisions of the Habitats Directive and the Commission therefore cannot take further action on this matter.
