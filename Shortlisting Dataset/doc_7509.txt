Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (6 June 2007) On 20 November 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation of Parliament and of the Council banning the placing on the market and the import to and the export from the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur COM(2006)684 final. . The proposal is currently under discussion in the Council and Parliament. The Commission prepared the proposal based on the elements collected during recent years. The Commission proposal foresees, in its Article 4, the possibility of a Comitology procedure based on the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health with the scrutiny of Parliament, to derogate from the prohibitions to market, import and export fur of cats and dogs and products containing such fur only in two cases: — if the fur or the product containing such fur is labelled as originating from cats and dogs that have not been bred or killed for fur production; — if the fur or the product containing such fur is part of personal goods or household effects which are brought into the Community or bought outside the Community. Both possibilities have been introduced to reflect the principle of proportionality. As long as such a decision is not adopted through the comitology procedure, no derogation from the prohibitions established by the regulation is granted.
