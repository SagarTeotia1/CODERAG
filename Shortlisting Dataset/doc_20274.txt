6 February 2003 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION further to the Commission statement pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure by Joaquim Miranda, Yasmine Boudjenah, Michel-Ange Scarbonchi, Luigi Vinci and Gérard Caudron on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group on access to medicines and paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health European Parliament resolution on access to medicines and paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health The European Parliament, – having regard to the Doha WTO Ministerial Declaration on the TRIPs Agreement and Public Health, adopted on 14 November 2001, and in particular paragraph 6 thereof, – having regard to its previous resolutions and those of the ACP-EU Assembly on AIDS, the WTO, and access to medicines for AIDS patients in the Third World (notably ACP‑EU 3305/01/fin., ACP-EU 3315/01/fin., A5-0331/2001 , B5-0691, B5-0692 and B5‑0693/2001 ), – having regard to the report on the proposed Parliament and Council regulation on aid for poverty-related diseases (Wijkman /omk/sipade2?L=EN&OBJID=8480&LEVEL=3&MODE=SIP&NAV=X&LSTDOC=N), A. whereas the separate Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health negotiated during the 2001 WTO Ministerial in Doha represented a minimum outcome arrived at in order to respond to the urgent concerns of the developing and least developed countries on such a crucial issue, including, in particular, the need to promote access to medicines for all and to put people before patents where appropriate, B. whereas paragraph 4 of the Doha Declaration states that ‘… the TRIPs agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health’. The same paragraph states that: ‘the [TRIPs] Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members’ right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all’, C. whereas paragraph 5(b) of the Doha Declaration reaffirms the right of countries to grant compulsory licences and the freedom to determine grounds upon which such licences are granted, and whereas paragraph 6(c) reaffirms that each member has the right to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, D. whereas WTO members which have sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity are not limited in any way as to the use of the compulsory license and do not need to refer to the WTO to use their rights under TRIPs, but, as recognised by paragraph 6, members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPs Agreement, E. whereas the WTO TRIPs Council was therefore mandated to find an expeditious solution to this problem and to report to the General Council before the end of 2002, F. whereas this mandate clearly intended that those countries which lack such capacity should not be put at a disadvantage by discriminatory restrictions and that the solution sought should be workable, automatic and economically viable, G. whereas the deadline was not met, primarily owing to the insistence of some pharmaceutical companies and the United States government that there needed to be further restrictive definitions of public health
