WRITTEN QUESTION E-1431/06 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (5 April 2006) Subject: Legal commitments under the third CSF in Greece Commissioner Hübner answered my Question E‑0490/06 but without providing the clarifications which I requested relating to the legal commitments concerning the take-up rate of appropriations under the third CSF. I am, therefore, compelled to restate my question. During a debate held in the Hellenic Parliament on 20 January 2006 on the take-up rate of EU resources, it was stated by the government official responsible, and I quote, that ‘there is the possibility of legal commitments not only in 2006 but also for 2007 and 2008’ even though he went on to state the absolute opposite, namely that ‘we do, of course, have the possibility of legal commitments until 2008 but in actual fact it is prohibited to go beyond 2006’(!). Can legal commitments really be entered into in both 2007 and 2008 with no problems attached?
