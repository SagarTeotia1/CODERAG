ORAL QUESTION H-0176/09 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2009 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Luisa Morgantini to the Council Subject: Demolition of 88 housing units in East Jerusalem Jerusalem City Council has decided to demolish 88 housing units, including 114 houses inhabited by some 1 500 Palestinian residents in the Al-Bustan district in Silwan – East Jerusalem. Other Palestinian families in the Abbasieh district and in the Shu’fat refugee camp have received new demolition and eviction notices, raising to 179 the total number of Palestinian houses that are to be demolished. According to B'Tselem, the Israeli authorities have demolished approximately 350 houses in East Jerusalem since 2004. Peace Now says that at least 73 300 new Israeli housing units will be built along the West Bank. Twenty Israeli writers and researchers, amongst them Amos Oz and David Grossman, called on him to cancel the orders because policies like this violate ‘the most basic human rights’. Even a confidential EU report says that ‘Israel's actions in and around Jerusalem constitute one of the most acute challenges to Israeli-Palestinian peace-making’. Does the Council not feel that it should act to stop these policies, using all the means at its disposal, including suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement with Israel in accordance with Article 2 thereof? Does this action not provide sufficient grounds, in the Council's view, for the upgrading of relations with Israel to be frozen?
