waive the immunity of one of its Members (provided that he or she is not protected by Article 9 of the IPP). 5. Nevertheless and as pointed out in Part II. C, even though the members of the national parliament (here the Czech parliament) and Members of the European Parliament from the Member State in question enjoy the same immunities (or none, as it is the case for MEPs from UK), whether to waive the immunity at a particular case depends on the European Parliament. In Dr Zelezný's declares that his prosecution in this case (and in the two other cases) is politically motivated. The European Parliament has to look into these allegations and decide whether there is or there is not evidence of fumus persecutionis on this case. This is the key issue here. 6. As has been declared many times by Parliament, immunity is not waived where the suspicion exists that the prosecution is based on the intention to prejudice the Member's political activities. The non existence of any fumus is conditio sine qua non for waiving immunity. as mentioned in Part II C. Who is supposed to assert the suspicion of fumus ? The obvious answer is Parliament, and before Parliament, its competent committee. How can such a conviction be arrived at with a certain degree of assurance? The persuasion of the Members of the committee, in doubtful, unclear cases, is always an intimate belief that, nevertheless, has to be founded on the soundest possible facts. By the way of examples, in past legislatures, the competent committee has taken into consideration the following factors: · the anonymous character of the denunciation, complaint or accusation Doc. 1-321/81 ; · the deferred submission of the accusation in relation to the date of the alleged acts A3-0021/93 , A3-0169/93 , A5-246/03 ; · an apparent link between the date of the accusation or denunciation and the Member's election to Parliament Doc-1-321/81 ; · the fact that legal proceedings were brought against the Member alone when more than one person could be considered liable or responsible A2-0090/88 , A5-246/03 ; · cases where the accusation was evidently unfounded (for instance, where it concerned decisions for which the Member was not responsible or where no evidence existed of his involvement in the reputed action) or there was an obvious aim to penalise the Member for his political activities A3-0247/90 , A3-0076/92 , A3-0077/92 . 7. Throught the fifth legislature, the practice in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market followed these guidelines, enriching them when necessary. Parliament decided not to waive the immunity in eight cases where the suspicion of fumus persecutionis was fully considered or was an important element of the decision. Sometimes it was not strongly evidenced. These cases were the following: BRIE ( A5-0151/00 ), PASCUA ( A5-0032/02 ) and MARCHIANI ( A5-0033/02 ), KORAKAS ( A5-0245/02 et A5-0420/03 ), COHN-BENDIT ( A5-246/03 ) and MARCHIANI ( A5-0422/03 et A5-0423/03 ). In a total of eight cases the committee considered that animus persecutionis was present to different degrees. In
