WRITTEN QUESTION E-4007/06 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) and Margrietus van den Berg (PSE) to the Commission (21 September 2006) Subject: Export of waste to third countries On 19 August the tanker Probo Koala unloaded waste for processing in Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire. The waste subsequently ended up in a residential neighbourhood. Six people have now died and 9000 are ill. Under the Basel Convention, waste may not be exported but may be sent to third countries for processing. Processing then has to be carried out by government accredited companies. European officials do not have any authority to approve accreditation, except in the meat sector. Developing countries are involved with waste from Europe in a number of ways. Waste for processing, scrapped vehicles, ships and white goods. This is not the first time that waste has been processed or dumped in an unsafe way in developing countries. This goes against the spirit of the Basel Convention. In addition to waste, many products are shipped to developing countries for the second-hand market. 1. Is the Commission prepared to examine the possibility of revising current legislation so as to require processing companies in third countries to be accredited by the EU as well? 2. Will it take steps to ensure that amounts paid for the disposal of scrapped goods or second-hand articles go to third countries along with the goods? 3. Will the Commission transfer knowledge the ACP countries within the EU‑ACP framework to help them ensure that international legislation in this area is more strictly enforced?
