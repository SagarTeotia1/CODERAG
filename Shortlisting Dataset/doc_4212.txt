Question for written answer E-5105/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Andrey Kovatchev (PPE) , László Tőkés (PPE) , Milan Zver (PPE) and Cristian Dan Preda (PPE) (8 July 2010) Subject: The archives of the former Yugoslav communist secret service UDBA According to the Study Centre for National Reconciliation in Slovenia, the archives of the activities of the former Yugoslav totalitarian communist secret service in Slovenia, the UDBA, are now in Serbia. The citizens of Slovenia, an EU Member State, did not have the right of access to these archives related to their past during the Yugoslav totalitarian communist regime. These archives are now in another country, namely the Republic of Serbia, which officially applied for EU membership on 22 December 2009. The Government of the Republic of Slovenia has asked the Government of the Republic of Serbia several times to provide the Slovenian citizens with access to these archives, but this has not happened. The situation is the same for the citizens of other former Yugoslav republics, whose citizens do not have access to the archives of the UDBA. Furthermore — the citizens of the Republic of Serbia do not themselves have access to the archives of the UDBA. The Government of the Republic of Serbia is preparing its country for EU accession. This means that the right of free access to information by the citizens of that country and citizens of all EU Member States must be respected by the Serbian Government. What measures will the Commission undertake to urge the Government of the Republic of Serbia to open the archives of the UDBA in order to allow for access by the citizens of Serbia, the citizens of all EU Member States, as well as the citizens of former Yugoslav republics which are not EU Member States?
