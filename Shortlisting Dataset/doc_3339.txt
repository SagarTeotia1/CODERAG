Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (14 January 2008) The Commission does not have any information that would enable it to make a judgment on the sourcing options for the gas for the Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline. Such decisions are commercial issues dealt with by the project promoters. At this stage no reliable information has been received. There is certainly a variety of sources from which gas be brought, and there appears to be enough to fill the pipeline. The Commission has no reliable data on SouthStream, for which the feasibility study is still to be carried out. No definite route for SouthStream has been proposed. The Commission has appointed Jozias van Aartsen to coordinate projects contained within the definition of Priority Axis Natural Gas 3 under the TEN‑E Programme. The three projects involved (i.e. Turkey-Greece Interconnector — TG just inaugurated; the gas interconnector Greece-Italy –IGI and the offshore pipeline Greece Italy — Poseidon) have benefited or still benefit from EU funding for feasibility studies, in the framework of the TEN‑E Programme. The European Investment Bank gave a loan of EUR 22 million for the first mentioned project. The list of all TEN‑E financed projects between 1995‑2006 can be downloaded at: http://ec.europa.eu/ten/energy/studies/doc/ten_e_financed_projects_95_06.pdf Information about the projects can be found in the ‘Priority Interconnection Plan’ document: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/electricity/report_2006/index_en.htm
