a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing – towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy ( 2006/2003(INI) ) Draftswoman: Ilda Figueiredo SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Recalls that manufacturing industry in Europe represents 20% of production and 34 million jobs, and that the European Union must aspire to remain a major industrial power, and not merely confine itself to developing the services sector; 2. Considers that the Community policy of aid and support for national industrial policies must aim to develop European Flagships for Excellence, creating synergies between the skills of local labour markets and research centres, without neglecting a political and macroeconomic environment geared to development, and as a means of promoting greater investment, create wealth and high-quality jobs with rights; welcomes the fact that the Commission’s political strategy paper gives a definition of a European industrial policy; stresses, however, that this approach must not be purely horizontal but that there is also a need to think in sector-specific terms; 3. Is of the opinion that, as far as individual sectors are concerned, workers’ trade unions, consumer associations, and employers’ organisations must be involved in the debate so as to help ensure that industrial policy solutions will be better suited to their purpose and more comprehensive; 4. Stresses the importance of establishing a dialogue with all the parties concerned, and welcomes the creation of the High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment; 5. Calls on the Commission to act more determinedly towards creating a strong and effective social dialogue and firm partnerships between employers, trade unions and public authorities; stresses that this social dialogue is a useful tool for improving cooperation at the level of individual undertakings, and within the manufacturing industry in general, because it can contribute to creating a better balance between the various interests by involving all actors in the decision-making and implementation processes; recognises the importance of works councils; 6. Recognises that, to pursue a European industrial policy in sectors of strategic interest to the Member States’ economies, it is essential to strengthen existing industries, keep the internal market open, applying regulation as and where necessary, and allow for factors related to competitiveness which could affect employment levels in many Member States, as well as supporting the modernisation of all European industry that is already competitive or could be enabled to compete; 7. Believes that, as regards the measures to be taken, especially in the WTO, it is necessary to allow for the context obtaining in, and the specific characteristics of, each sector, the opportunities and challenges that may arise, and the difficulties posed for individual Member States; 8. Welcomes the Commission proposal to integrate and coordinate industrial policy with other policies, including cohesion, environmental, R & D, and energy policies; notes that cohesion policy and industrial policy are interrelated, given that infrastructure and human resources are needed to enable industrial policy to succeed and to
