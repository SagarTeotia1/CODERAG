Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2012) The Commission has decided to address the problem of misleading directory companies in the context of a communication, scheduled to be published in the first half of 2012. In this context, Member States have already reported on their implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC and on the activities of misleading directory companies as well as on actions taken to prevent them. The Member States seem to confirm that they lack legal tools for effective enforcement in cross-border cases of misleading advertising. Moreover, on 21 October 2011, the Commission published a public consultation on Directive 2006/114/EC on Misleading and Comparative Advertising and on unfair commercial practices affecting business. An important part of this consultation was dedicated to the practices of misleading directory companies. The consultation was closed on 16 December 2011 and the Commission received 280 responses. While the need for a future legislative action is currently evaluated, the Commission will also organise meetings with the Member States' authorities in the course of 2012 to coordinate enforcement actions in cross-border cases of business-to-business misleading schemes and to exchange information. In the attachment, the Honourable Member will find the contact details of the relevant enforcement authorities in Ireland, Germany and Spain.
