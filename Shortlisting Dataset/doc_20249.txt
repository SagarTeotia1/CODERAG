2004/C 78 E/243 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3219/03 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE) to the Commission (31 October 2003) Subject: Recognition of fire regulations in the EU With regard to the fireproofing of fabrics there seems to be confusion over the recognition of different standard marks from EU countries. Would the Commission confirm that the British standard mark number for the fireproofing of fabric, BS5867 PART 2B, is equivalent to the French mark number M1? Is the British standard mark legally acceptable in France? Could the Commission give details of the legislation within the EU that concerns this?
