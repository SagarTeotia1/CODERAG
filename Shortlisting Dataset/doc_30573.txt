WRITTEN QUESTION P-2007/06 by Riccardo Ventre (PPE‑DE) to the Council (3 May 2006) Subject: Implementation of ‘Plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate’ and feedback received to date Through a communiqué from Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnick, the Austrian Presidency of the EU has announced that an informal Foreign Ministers’ meeting will be held on 27 and 28 May to discuss the future of the Constitution. In October 2005 the Commission announced its own line of action during the ‘reflection period’ by publishing ‘Plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate’, aimed at involving ordinary citizens in discussions on the future of the EU and the Constitution. The gathering of synthesis reports by Member States, based on the presentation of the results of national debates, is a vitally important process. The initial feedback, aimed to drawing a first set of conclusions, was scheduled for April. Following the ‘no’ vote in the French and Dutch ratification referendums, it is essential to restore people's trust in the European Union and to take due account of the desires of civil society, the social parties and national parliaments, in addition to those traditionally associated with such matters. Will the Council state how many Member States have submitted to the Commission and the Council Presidency the first set of conclusions drawn from the national debates forming part of Plan D, and will it specify which Member States have done so? Will the Council state to what extent it will be possible to use this feedback during the meeting announced by the Austrian Presidency of the EU for 27 and 28 May?
