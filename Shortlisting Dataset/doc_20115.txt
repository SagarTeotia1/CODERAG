Question for written answer P-011997/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (13 December 2011) Subject: The International Court of Justice ruling of 5 December 2011, concerning Greece's objection to NATO membership for the Republic of Macedonia The Council will be aware of the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) of 5 December 2011, finding that Greece, by objecting to the admission of the Republic of Macedonia (referred to here in the form acceptable to Greece as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia — FYROM) to NATO, has breached its obligation under Article 11, paragraph 1 of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995, agreed between Greece and Macedonia, which states ‘[Greece] agrees not to object to the application by or the membership of [FYROM] in international, multilateral and regional organisations and institutions of which [Greece] is a member’. This ruling has clear implications for the long-standing delay in the opening of EU accession negotiations for Macedonia. The opening of these talks has been successively blocked through repeated use of the veto or not allowing the issue to be on the agenda at Council level since Macedonia attained candidate status in 2005, and most recently at the General Affairs Council of 5 December. Considering the recent ICJ ruling, can the Council comment on whether this will affect the prospects for Macedonia opening EU accession negotiations under the FYROM name and when is this likely to be?
