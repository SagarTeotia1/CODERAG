WRITTEN QUESTION E-4840/07 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (4 October 2007) Subject: Creation of an autonomous ministry for the environment in Greece Following the unprecedented ecological disaster caused by the thousands of fires that devastated Greece, environmental organisations and a large number of citizens have highlighted the need to create an autonomous ministry for the environment. Even though a new government has been formed after the recent parliamentary elections, responsibility for environmental matters remains with the combined Ministry for the Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works. Can the Commission say which EU Member States have an autonomous ministry for the environment? Does the Commission believe that the establishment of a separate ministry for the environment, with responsibilities clearly differentiated from planning and public works, will contribute towards more effective environmental protection and the improved application of Community environmental legislation, areas in which Greece is lagging behind?
