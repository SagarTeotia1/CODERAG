21.1.2009 OPINION of the Committee on Development for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the future of the European Common Asylum System ( 2008/2305(INI) ) Rapporteur: Danutė Budreikaitė SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Development calls on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Notes that in the past year the number of refugees has grown to more than 16 million worldwide; in this context, supports the establishment of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and welcomes the Commission’s Policy Plan on Asylum, serving as a roadmap for the completion of the CEAS; 2. Regrets that the concept of the institution of asylum, an essential part of democracy and protection of human rights, has been severely eroded in recent years; reiterates the need for full respect of the rights and needs of asylum seekers and the principle of non-refoulement; 3. Underlines that a CEAS should be established that is fully coherent with the objectives and activities in the area of refugee protection of EU instruments for cooperation with developing countries (such as the European Development Fund (EDF), the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)) and agreements and partnerships between the EU and developing countries (such as the Cotonou Agreement and the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership); 4. Welcomes the Commission’s intention to amend Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status OJ L 326, 13.12.2005, p. 13. and underlines that the common asylum procedure should provide for clear, uniform and reasonable time limits for the authorities to decide on an asylum application, thus avoiding long and unwarranted waiting periods which could have negative consequences for asylum seekers’ health and well-being; reiterates that granting of refugee or subsidiary protection status should always be subject to an individual assessment and in no way be limited to a generalised assessment (e.g. based on nationality) or conditionality (e.g. relating to the human rights situation in a country of origin); 5. Stresses that during the waiting periods authorities should take into consideration the different needs of asylum seekers in a more fragile situation, such as children, people with disabilities and women, and provide the necessary infrastructure; 6. Shares the Commission’s view that asylum is an integral part of development cooperation with third countries rather than a crisis management tool; reiterates also that development cooperation, particularly crisis prevention, human rights monitoring, conflict transformation and peace-building, could serve as a preventive instrument of displacement; stresses therefore that CEAS should be closely connected with European development and humanitarian policies; 7. Looks forward to the assessment of the Regional Protection Programmes (RPPs) due to take place in 2009; underlines that the development of such programmes should be fully coherent with National and Regional Action Plans, the Thematic Programme on Migration and Asylum of the DCI and, more generally, should never be a means to remove
