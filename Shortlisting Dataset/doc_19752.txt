Adjustment 23. Notes that, while trade adjustment is not expressly referred to in the above-mentioned Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration it should be included as an important element of the wider AfT agenda; recalls, in this regard, that the UN Millennium Project's Task Force on Trade proposed a temporary "aid for trade fund", while the EU Trade Commissioner himself proposed (on 4 February 2005) the establishment of a special Trade Adjustment Fund to "help the poor to trade more effectively and ease the social costs of adjustment"; 24. Notes that trade-related adjustment costs cover a wide range of issues, and mainly include: firstly, the costs of preference erosion, which particularly affect countries dependent on exports of textiles and agricultural commodities, secondly, loss of revenue from trade tariffs and, thirdly, costs resulting from increases in food prices which are likely to affect net food importing countries and which will mainly affect the poorer sectors of the population; 25. Emphasises that the added costs of compliance with product standard requirements, including sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and the costs of implementing WTO agreements, such as Trade-related Investment Measures (TRIMs), Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which requires sophisticated changes in policies and legislation, are often considered adjustment costs, but also emphasises that they overlap with the 'trade policy and regulation' AfT category; notes that costs relating to factors of production, such as those of managing short-term unemployment and of retraining, are also considered by some experts as trade-related adjustment costs; 26. Notes that balance of payments support is a general development policy tool that can and should also be utilised to address adjustment costs; 27. Stresses that adjustment costs are particularly relevant in the context of European Partnership Agreements (EPAs); 28. Recognises the growing concerns in Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States at the methods of delivery, effectiveness and quality of EC-administered AfT in support of economic adjustment programmes; 29. Stresses that trade adjustment should not be understood as mere compensation to be paid for the erosion of preferences or the wider effects of liberalisation, but as a mechanism to facilitate the difficult transition to a more liberalised environment; 30. Believes that adjustment assistance in response to trade shocks is indispensable to facilitate acceptance of freer trade, since, in the absence of adjustment assistance and social safety nets, trade liberalisation will be resisted or reversed; considers that the EU's ability to finance and implement AfT in this regard will require a much deeper understanding of the adjustment processes that workers, consumers, businesses and governments of developing countries experience as a result of trade liberalisation; 31. Notes that the Trade Integration Mechanism (TIM) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was devised in 2004 to help countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties to cope with the effects of trade liberalisation, is subject to usual IMF policy conditionality and terms of lending, and may therefore be unsuitable for countries that are already highly indebted and/or do not wish to have an IMF programme; acknowledges with concern that this
