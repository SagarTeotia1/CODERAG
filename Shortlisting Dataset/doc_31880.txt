been at the forefront for green responsibility, particularly regarding waste, energy consumption, transport and CO 2 reduction; supports the commitments they have already taken towards sustainable consumption, but considers further efforts are necessary; considers that corporate responsibility should pay greater attention to social and environmental issues; 44. Emphasises that retailers and suppliers are drivers of innovation, research and development; stresses that the whole sector needs to continue driving up the level of investment in innovative technologies and practices to further improve competitiveness throughout the supply chain, covering logistics and transport, energy efficiency, packaging, waste disposal and product recycling, and to exchange best practices; 45. Calls on the Commission to develop a common assessment and labelling system, as indicated in its resolution on a single market for enterprises and growth, based on the product’s whole life cycle, particularly in order to simplify, harmonise and overcome the cost of fragmentation for business and consumers; 46. Calls on stakeholders to take further initiatives to combat food waste; 47. Welcomes the joint agreement by EuroCommerce and UNI-Europa, which illustrates that social dialogue is working well in commerce; recognises that more needs to be done to increase consumer information on the social responsibility of retailers, to match investments in new technologies with human capital, in particular through competence development, and to combat the informal economy; 48. Recalls the importance of proper implementation of existing social and labour legislation; regrets the existence of a high degree of undeclared employment, which involves a high level of tax evasion and prevents a level playing field among traders in the internal market; 49. Points out that improving working conditions, combating the informal economy and maintaining employment levels and competitiveness by better matching the needs of the retailers to the skills of the workers are among the main challenges in this sector; highlights, to this end, the need to invest in training and competence building as this will help the sector adapt quickly to new technologies; W ay ahead 50. Asks the Commission to prepare, in consultation with the retail sector, a comprehensive European Action Plan for Retail in order to set out a strategy, building on achievements and addressing outstanding issues, with sector-specific recommendations; welcomes the fact that Parliament has supported this initiative in its resolution on a single market for enterprises and growth; 51. Stresses that this Action Plan should take into account initiatives already developed by the Commission, such as the High Level Forum on the Better Functioning of the Food Supply Chain, initiatives on sustainability and climate change, and relevant proposals of the Single Market Act; 52. Proposes that follow-up to the recommended actions in the Action Plan, including progress made in the dialogue among stakeholders, be presented and debated at the first Retail Market Roundtable; 53. Expects that the further optimisation of purchasing and sales processes throughout the retail supply chain, from market research and product marketing to supplier relations, logistics and stock management, as well as the handling of faulty goods, consumer complaints and custom care, will improve competitiveness in the retail sector, drive down prices
