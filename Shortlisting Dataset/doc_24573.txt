the MoU was published on 9 July 2005 OJ L 177, 9.7.2005 . . Exports from China made as from 11 June 2005 will be set off against the ceilings applicable from that date and until the end of the year. China will issue export licenses for shipments as from 20 July 2005 when the so-called double control system will become fully operational. The Commission has published, on the website of the Trade DG, a notice to importers and traders with information about rules to be applied, pending the publication of the amended regulation on 9 July. However, contrary to the allegations by the Honourable Member about overutilisation of quotas already in June, and as can be observed by consulting the Commission’s website (http://sigl.cec.eu.int), the Commission considers that import figures available from the beginning of July do not show that the limits are being exceeded.
