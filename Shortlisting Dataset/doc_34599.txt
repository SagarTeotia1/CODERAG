Question for written answer E-008508/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Roger Helmer (ECR) (23 September 2011) Subject: Spanish Property Road Show in the UK from 13 to 15 October 2011 Is the Commission aware that the Spanish government plans to hold a ‘Spanish Property Road Show’ in the United Kingdom from 13 to 15 October in order to persuade UK citizens that it is safe to purchase property in Spain? It is reported that this exercise is being funded by EU money. Is this the case? If so, how much? Given the ongoing scandal of Spanish property, the thousands of EU citizens who have lost their property and life savings in the Spanish property scam, and the failure of the EU institutions to protect property rights and enforceable contracts in this context, does the Commission not agree that EU funding to promote Spanish property ownership is improper, or even scandalous? Will the Commission undertake to defray any losses suffered by citizens as a result of this promotion exercise? You will be aware of the Spanish property scandal, where hundreds of UK citizens, and thousands more from across the EU, have purchased properties in Spain with due diligence, taking legal advice, only to have their ownership rights overturned by the Spanish Coastal Law or local zoning laws. Many Europeans have spent their life savings on a dream retirement home on the Costas, only to wake up one morning to find an eviction notice on the doormat and a bulldozer at the gate.
