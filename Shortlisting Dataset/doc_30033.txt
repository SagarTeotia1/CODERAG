Question for written answer E-010900/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (24 November 2011) Subject: National reform programmes and the Europe 2020 strategy 2011 is the first year of the Europe 2020 strategy in which a commitment was made to support comprehensive, smart and sustainable development. The European Anti‑Poverty Network has drafted a report on this subject that analyses Member States' national reform programmes. The report deals with macroeconomic issues, employment, social inclusion, education, professional training and structural funds. It points out that, as the crisis deepens and Member States endeavour to save the euro, they are coming out in favour of rapid deficit reduction through making cuts to social programmes, and that such economic governance is weakening national governments' motivation to meet anti‑poverty goals. The report also sets out several key recommendations that seek to ensure that the Europe 2020 strategy results in growth that is inclusive. What is the Commission's opinion on these recommendations? In what way is the Commission currently helping to guarantee growth that benefits all?
