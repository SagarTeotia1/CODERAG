Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (30 March 2011) 1. The European Commission does not collect statistics disaggregated on the basis of ethnic origin. It is therefore not able to comment on birth rates in ‘ethnic communities’ nor on ‘indigenous populations’. The Commission notes, moreover, that the notion of an indigenous population is an inherently intangible one, in view of the constant migration of persons into and out of Europe over the centuries. 2. As already mentioned in the reply to the Honourable Member's Questions E‑4890/10 , E‑4894/10 , E‑4900/10 and E‑6005/10 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , it is for each Member State to decide the number of third‑country nationals that it admits to its territory. As that decision is taken at Member State level, citizens of the Member States are involved in the normal democratic decision-making process at national level.
