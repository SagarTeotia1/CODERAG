2006 creating a European order for payment procedure OJ L 399, 30.12.2006, p. 1. , Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure OJ L 199, 31.7.2007, p. 1. , Council Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 of 18 December 2008 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations OJ L 7, 10.1.2009, p. 1. and Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 OJ L 338, 23.12.2003, p. 1. , – having regard to Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) OJ L 199, 31.7.2007, p. 40. , – having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee of 16 December 2009, – having regard to Rules 48 and 119(2) of its Rules of Procedure, – having regard to the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs ( A7-0219/2010 ), A. whereas Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, with its predecessor the Brussels Convention, is one of the most successful pieces of EU legislation; whereas it laid the foundations for a European judicial area, has served citizens and business well by promoting legal certainty and predictability of decisions through uniform European rules – supplemented by a substantial body of case-law – and avoiding parallel proceedings, and is used as a reference and a tool for other instruments, B. whereas, notwithstanding this, it has been criticised following a number of rulings of the Court of Justice and is in need of modernisation, C. whereas abolition of exequatur – the Commission's main objective – would expedite the free movement of judicial decisions and form a key milestone in the building of a European judicial area, D. whereas exequatur is seldom refused: only 1 to 5% of applications are appealed and those appeals are rarely successful; whereas, nonetheless, the time and expense of getting a foreign judgment recognised are hard to justify in the single market and this may be particularly vexatious where a claimant wishes to seek enforcement against a judgment debtor's assets in several jurisdictions, E. whereas there is no requirement for exequatur in several EU instruments: the European enforcement order, the European payment order, the European small claims procedure and the maintenance obligations regulation See the 9th recital in the preamble. , F. whereas abolition of exequatur should be effected by providing that a judicial decision qualifying for recognition and enforcement under the Regulation which is enforceable in the Member State in which it was given is enforceable throughout the EU; whereas this should be coupled with an exceptional procedure available to the party against whom enforcement is sought so as to guarantee an adequate right of recourse to the courts of the State of enforcement in the event that that party wishes to contest enforcement on
