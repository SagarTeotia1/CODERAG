WRITTEN QUESTION E-5735/09 by Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) to the Commission (24 November 2009) Subject: School drop-out rate The economic crisis affecting Member States and the deteriorating standard of living, poverty and unemployment have led to a significant rise in the school drop-out rate. Increased economic hardship is the key reason why pupils drop out of school, which they are doing in increasing numbers in order to meet the needs of their families today. In view of the above, will the Commission say: — What specific and measurable data does it have at its disposal about the school drop-out rate in the EU as a whole and Greece in particular? — What measures does it intend to take to curb this phenomenon? — What plans are in place to ensure the smooth transition of young people from school to professional life?
