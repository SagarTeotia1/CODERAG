Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2010) The Commission is well aware of the planned construction of a container port in Komos bay, in the region of Tymbaki, Sourthern Crete, and its potential significant effects on nature conservation areas and species protected under the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . The Commission raised the matter with the Greek authorities who specified that the environmental assessment process for the project was not completed as no full environmental impact study had been submitted to the competent services and therefore no authorisation of the project had been granted. The Greek authorities further confirmed that in all cases they would ensure compliance with all relevant provisions of the Habitats Directive as regards nearby Natura 2000 sites likely to be affected. The planning of any projects and developments in Komos bay has to be done in full compliance with applicable EU environmental legislation. In particular, according to Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, if the project in question is likely to have a significant effect on any Natura 2000 sites, it has to be subject to an appropriate assessment with regard to the conservation values of the site and it can only be authorised if the authorities have ascertained that it will not affect the integrity of the site. It is the responsibility of the Greek authorities to fully implement the provisions of the Habitats Directive in order to safeguard the nature conservation interests of the area, including important habitats of the sea turtle Caretta caretta. The Commission can further investigate the case if it is provided evidence of potential breach of EU legislation.
