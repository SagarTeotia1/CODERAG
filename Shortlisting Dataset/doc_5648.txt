2004/C 51 E/130 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1614/03 by Chris Davies (ELDR) to the Commission (13 May 2003) Subject: Energy efficiency of electrical appliances The Commission will be aware of the findings of the recent study by the International Energy Agency which concluded that introduction of more energy-efficient domestic electrical appliances could enable developed countries to cut their energy consumption by 30 % by 2010, and contribute significantly to meeting targets for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. What plans does the Commission have to introduce mandatory standards for energy performance in electrical equipment, and to extend energy labelling schemes?
