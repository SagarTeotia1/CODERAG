Reply (16 April 2008) As the Honourable Member rightly notes, Criterion 2 of the European Code of Conduct provides that a Member State may not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression, and Criterion 3 of the same code provides that the Member States shall not allow exports which would provoke or prolong armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in the countries of final destination. Application of the Code in concrete cases falls within the competence of Member States, as does transposition of its terms into national laws and procedures. That being said, the Council would assure the Honorouble Member that Member States apply the Code in a responsible manner.
