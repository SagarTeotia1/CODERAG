Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (25 April 2005) The EU recognises the need to ensure that developing countries (DC) benefit fully from the expansion of world trade. The EU is party to a series of regional and bilateral trade agreements with third countries which provide preferential access to our market, which also includes agricultural products. The key is to create opportunities for increased trade for developing countries, while recognising the importance of food security, and accepting the need of the most vulnerable developing countries to maintain protection in their markets in order to have adequate time for adaptation. On these grounds, and bearing in mind the fact that agriculture is central to the livelihoods of the world’s poor, the EU always supported and actively asked for the following package of enhanced measures in favour of developing countries in the context of the Doha Development Agenda: All developed countries shall ensure that zero duty access for DC exports of agricultural products represent no less than 50 % of their total imports from DCs. A commitment should be adopted by developed countries and advanced DCs to provide duty and quota free access for all imports from the Least-Developed Countries, as the EU has done with its ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative.
