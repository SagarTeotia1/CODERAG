WRITTEN QUESTION E-0842/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (13 February 2009) Subject: Use of PC monitors and energy saving According to the results of a study carried out by EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency of the US Government), websites which have a predominantly white background consume far more electrical energy than those in which darker colours are predominant, especially if the screen used is a CRT screen. Indeed, the study has revealed that there is actually a 20% difference in energy consumption between white background CRT screens and dark background CRT screens. As far as LCD screens are concerned, the problem is secondary given that these screens are not so sensitive to colour differences, but the differences in terms of energy expenditure nevertheless fall within the range of 3% to 8%. The study has therefore raised a very important issue, given the widespread use of PCs throughout the world. Further to this study, does the Commission not consider that a change in the design and graphic layout of the websites of EU institutions could enable a considerable amount of electrical energy to be saved? Does it not think that a similar measure, possibly to be taken in tandem with a programme of financial incentives for the purchase of LCD monitors to replace CRT monitors, could be a further step towards attaining the goal of total environmental sustainability for information technology (IT)?
