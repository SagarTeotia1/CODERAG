Question for written answer E-6867/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Werner Langen (PPE) (1 September 2010) Subject: Income tax declaration by a German national in Austria A German national has been renting out a small apartment in Spittal, Austria, for more than fifteen years. She has filled in a tax declaration each year but, since the sum in question is only about EUR 2 500, has never been required to pay income tax. When she filed her tax declaration for 2009, the Spittal tax office added on the estimated sum of EUR 9 000 under paragraph 102(3) of the Income Tax Law, so that approximately EUR 11 200 was to be taxed. This meant that income tax amounting to EUR 69.79 was payable for 2009. An answer dating from 2007 from the then Commissioner Kovacs states that the addition is attributable to a technical adjustment, which is not carried out if all, or virtually all, the taxpayer’s income is derived from Austrian sources. I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following questions: 1. Are the action of the tax office concerned and the application of paragraph 102(3) of the Income Tax Law compatible with EC law? 2. Is the obviously unequal treatment of German and Austrian nationals in this instance compatible with EC law? 3. What proposals will the Commission make in order to put a stop to this unequal treatment?
