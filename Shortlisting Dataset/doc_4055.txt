Question for written answer E-5551/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Sandrine Bélier (Verts/ALE) , Margrete Auken (Verts/ALE) and Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (19 July 2010) Subject: Violations of the Aarhus Convention in the Rila Mountains, Bulgaria Bulgarian nature conservation NGOs have repeatedly encountered serious violations of the Aarhus Convention in relation to the granting of development licences for infrastructure and investment projects in the Rila Mountains area. The Supreme Administrative Court, the Ministry of Environment and Waters, and the Directorate for National Construction Control (DNCC) in Bulgaria have all denied the right of Bulgarian citizens to challenge decisions relating to development licences, strategic environmental assessments, environmental impact assessments and appropriate assessments, in clear breach of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention. Can the Commission please tell us whether the seminar on the application of EU environmental law it held in May 2009 for judges from Bulgaria covered the Aarhus Convention? Can the Commission also please tell us what action it is taking to ensure that the Bulgarian Government complies with the provisions of the Aarhus Convention?
