to date . 2. The Commission shall provide a help desk in order to support organisers and to enter into a dialogue from an early stage of the procedure. The Commission shall , upon request, inform the organisers of current or intended legislative proposals on matters raised by the initiative and of other registered citizens' initiatives that wholly or partly concern the same matter. Justification For the sake of the success of this new democratic tool, it is important that citizens are well informed about the procedure to be followed. The Commission should therefore provide a user friendly guide on the initiative and should set up a help desk which would be a natural reference point to organisers if they have questions or if they wish to clarify a certain issue with the EU institution responsible for the registration of the initiative. Especially, the Commission should help the organisers with information on current or intended legislative proposals, in order to avoid wasting energy on a matter that is already took up by the Commission. The information on other registered initiatives concerning the same matter could enhance the European dimension of initiatives.
