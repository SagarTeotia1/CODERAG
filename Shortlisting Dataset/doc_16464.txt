WRITTEN QUESTION E-1978/04 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 September 2004) Subject: Closure of Elefanten (C & J Clark) in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal Yet another footwear factory has announced its closure, scheduled for the end of August 2004, making some 300 mostly female workers redundant. The factory concerned is Elefanten, located at Seixezelo (Vila Nova de Gaia), Portugal, belonging to the British multinational C & J Clark, which has earlier closed two factories in Portugal (in Arouca and Castelo da Paiva), generating over a thousand redundancies. Following the closure of the C & J Clark factory in Castelo de Paiva, Parliament adopted resolution 106/2003 (13 March 2003), in which it called on the Commission and the Member States to withdraw subsidies from aid programmes from companies not complying with their obligations and to ask them to reimburse the monies paid. 1. Can the Commission state what measures have been taken, following C & J Clark's factory closures in Arouca and Castelo de Paiva (Portugal), to obtain reimbursement of the Community funds (EUR 1.7 m) paid out to that company? 2. Can the Commission state what measures it is taking in protection of the rights of the Elefanten workers and, above all, their right to employment?
