WRITTEN QUESTION P-5805/07 by Stavros Arnaoutakis (PSE) to the Commission (21 November 2007) Subject: Partial application of the N+3 rule to Greek programmes for the 2000‑06 period and impact on the take-up rate for the programmes Bearing in mind its recent decision to reject the request for the full application of the N+3 rule to Greek programmes for the 2000‑06 period: Will the Commission say: 1. Which are the sectoral and regional programmes which are lagging furthest behind in taking up available funds to date? 2. Does any assessment exist about the overall funds which are at risk in the third Community support framework? 3. Which are the specific regional programmes for which requests for application of the N+3 rule have been accepted? 4. Does the Commission intend to authorise the application of the N+3 rule to sectoral programmes and under which conditions? 5. Given that delays in the execution of programming are due to a large extent to problems in managing the programmes, does the Commission intend to incorporate gained ‘experience’ with the 2000‑06 programming period in planning and drawing up implementing methods for the new programmes for the 2007‑13 period? If so, how does it intend to do so?
