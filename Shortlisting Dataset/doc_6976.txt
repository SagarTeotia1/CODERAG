Reply (30 May 2005) As the Honourable Member has been reminded on the occasion of replies by the Council to his previous questions, the European Union is firmly committed to combating all forms of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia as well as to combating discrimination against people with disabilities. The will to build an ‘Area of Freedom, Security and Justice’ makes the development of a coherent justice and security policy a growing priority. Despite displaying considerable efforts in those fields, the European Union is not always able to counter tragic and negative developments such as the ones referred to by the Honourable Member which, moreover, are primarily a concern for the Member States' law enforcement authorities. This requires simultaneous attention to both the internal and external dimension of the European Union's relevant policies and the fine-tuning of a multidimensional approach to the phenomena the Honourable Member is referring to, which takes into consideration all instruments at the EU's disposal. In this context, under the Hague programme adopted by the European Council on 4 and 5 November 2004, the Council will give the concept of internal security within a common area of freedom, security and justice a genuinely European dimension, on the basis of an integral concept covering police and judicial aspects of operational cooperation. To that end, the Council has been invited to prepare for the setting‑up of the Committee on Internal Security envisaged in Article III-261 of the Constitutional Treaty. Moreover, the Council invites the Honourable Member to refer to the wide range of Community measures already adopted to uphold the principle of non-discrimination, in particular the decision of the JHA Council on 24 February 2005 to relaunch the negotiations on the draft Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia.
