Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2011) As a universal human rights, freedom of religion or belief is a priority under the EU’s human rights policy. The EU has to promote it and for everyone, outside and within the EU. The EU does not associate itself with specific religions or beliefs, and has to lead by exemplarity. The EU Delegation in Cairo is in regular contact with civil society organisations to monitor the situation of human rights in Egypt and to propose appropriate actions to address specific issues which are of particular concern. The EU Delegation in Cairo contacted relevant Human rights and Coptic organisations to enquire about the concerns raised by the Honourable Members. To gather further information about the concerns raised by the Honourable Members, the Delegation carried out a thorough investigation and contacted two renowned non‑governmental organisations (NGOs) (Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights), the editor-in-chief of a Coptic newspaper ( Watani ) and a Coptic lawyer and activist. The conclusion which has emerged after these consultations is that allegations of ‘frequent’ and ‘systematic’ abductions, rapes, as well as forced conversions is a vey complex issue to investigate. It is a multifaceted problem for which it seems difficult to find evidences and to establish the truth. The unwillingness of the police in gathering the information needed to instruct properly each case is an aggravating factor. The EU will continue to urge the Egyptian authorities to cooperate on this matter. Should the Honourable Members would wish to do so, the European External Action Service (EEAS) stands ready to meet them to discuss further the issue and explore ways on how it could be addressed by the EU.
