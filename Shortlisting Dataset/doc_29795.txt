up to EUR 500 billion, 1. Expresses its deep disappointment at the main elements of the new Europe 2020 strategy agreed by the European Council on 26 March; 2. Believes that the European Council has missed a historic opportunity to draw all the lessons from the current crisis and to define a truly far-sighted, ambitious and coherent strategy; notes, in this respect, that the Lisbon strategy – regardless of its own limitations in terms of methodology – had provided a balanced and clear vision for Europe’s future which is now at the risk of being lost; 3. Reiterates its earlier calls for a single and integrated development strategy for Europe, clearly defining a long term orientation for economic growth, and how growth can help build a better, fairer and more sustainable economy with more shared prosperity for all, and protect against financial sector greed and excess; reiterates its demand to integrating the overlapping strategies which Europe is currently supposed to follow, notably the Europe 2020 strategy, the Sustainable Development strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP); regrets that the European Council refused this approach, leaving the problem of policy incoherence unresolved; 4. Considers however that, over the next decade, the EU will face multiple challenges in assuring its economic and social progress, including the adverse consequences of the recession, and believes that these challenges call for an in-depth review of mechanisms through which the European employment and social objectives are to be delivered; 5. Considers the current fiscal crisis in the euro area – with 13 out of the 16 Member States failing to comply today with the SGP criteria, the ECB predictions that by 2011-2012 no member state will be able to comply, along with the extensive and systematic speculative attacks against national bonds – as a clear sign of the important shortcomings of the current EU economic coordination policy which relies mainly on fiscal consolidation and surveillance; underlines that in order to restore sound growth rates and achieve the objective of sustainable economic and social cohesion, full priority should also be given to dealing with persistent and significant macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness divergences within the euro area; welcomes, in this respect, the recognition of this necessity by the Commission in its communication on economic policy coordination; 6. Welcomes the Council’s decisions to strengthen eurozone governance with new instruments to face the challenges revealed by the crisis and on the implementation of the support package for Greece, the creation of a European financial Stability Mechanism, the strengthening of economic governance, the regulation of the financial markets and the fight against speculation; embracing thus the main principle that euro area problems shall be addressed through euro area solutions; considers that these new instruments should also reinforce the coordination of economic policies between all EU Member States beyond surveillance towards pro-active economic policy coordination, including strengthened governance mechanisms to implement the Europe 2020 strategy; regrets, in this respect, that while the Commission has been making wide-reaching proposals to strengthen budgetary surveillance, it has stopped short of proposing sufficiently relevant solutions for restoring
