Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (14 March 2011) The Commission draws the Honourable Member's attention to the Marie Curie Actions (MCAs) and in particular the recently launched Marie Curie Career Integration Grants (CIG) within the People Specific Programme (FP7). EUR 40 million is devoted to cover over 400 CIG grants in 2011, aiming at encouraging experienced European researchers to establish themselves in Europe, as well as to attract the best researchers worldwide to work in Europe. As from 2011, the researcher will be provided with an employment contract and attractive working conditions, including a research grant of EUR 25 000 per year during a period of two to four years. Besides the CIG, all other MCAs play an important role to attract researchers to Europe by offering attractive employment conditions in line with the ‘European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers’ http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/index.cfm/rights/index . They are setting standards for a favourable open recruitment policy for researchers and attractive careers with good working conditions, social security and pension rights, as well as a work-life balance. Since 2002, approximately 5 300 researchers have come to Europe on other Marie Curie fellowships, including some 1 000 through co-funded national programmes, of which many have stayed in Europe after the fellowship, or have continued with research collaborations. Moreover, since 2007, an International Research Staff Exchange Scheme (IRSES) has been set up within the MCAs to encourage collaborations with third countries. Some estimated 2 500 researchers coming from third countries to Europe have been retained for funding. In addition to the MCAs, since 2007, some 3 200 mobility grants have been awarded by the Erasmus Mundus programme, allowing non-EU researchers to come to Europe on a study or training visit.
