WRITTEN QUESTION E-1634/05 by Christine De Veyrac (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 May 2005) Subject: International trade and the Byrd amendment The Commission has just proposed, quite rightly, that the European Union take action in response to US anti-dumping legislation, known as the ‘Byrd amendment’. This legislation, which is deemed illegal by the WTO, allows the US authorities to distribute anti-dumping duties imposed on imported products to the US companies that filed complaints against their foreign competitors. However, the level of additional duties which the EU is preparing to impose from 1 May amounts to only EUR 28 million, whilst the aid which US companies have been receiving for four years under the Byrd amendment is estimated at over USD 1 billion! In these circumstances, does the Commission not think that it would be very appropriate, and present a greater deterrent, to revise upwards the level of additional duties which it is preparing to impose?
