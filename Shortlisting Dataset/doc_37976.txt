Directive No 2004/48/EC Directive 2004/48/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, OJ L 157, 30.4.2004 and Council Regulation No 1383/2003 Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003 of 22 July 2003 concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights, OJ L 196, 2.8.2003 . Finally, the EU also keeps an eye on the implementation of TRIPs obligation by its trading partners. With China, the Commission runs continuous talks in order to reduce the levels of counterfeiting and piracy. These discussions are held, in particular, in the context of the EU-China IPR Dialogue (which first met in October 2004). The issue was also on the agenda of Commissioner Mandelson's recent visit to China. At this occasion, the Chinese authorities agreed on the setting up of an IP Working Group to address specific problems that the EU industry faces there. The Commission and Chinese authorities are currently discussing the modalities of this IP Working Group. Important to mention also is the in November 2004 adopted ‘Strategy for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Third Countries’ (information available on the Commission’s - DG Trade Website). Finally, as far as customs tariffs are concerned, it should be recalled that Article 26 of the EC Treaty actually provides for means to waive either partly (tariff quotas) or totally (tariff suspensions) the normal customs duties applicable to certain imported goods. The main purpose of autonomous tariff suspensions or quotas is to enable Community enterprises to use raw materials, semi finished goods or components without being required to pay the normal duties laid down in the common customs tariff. Such measures are proposed after a thorough examination of the economic reasons on which the requests are based and only insofar as they seem likely to benefit the Community economy. When dealing with such tariff suspensions or tariff quotas requests, the Commission follows the guidelines set out in the Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas OJ C 128, 25.4.1998 .
