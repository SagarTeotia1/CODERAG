Question for written answer E-004557/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) and Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) (11 May 2011) Subject: The social economy — characteristics and support The social economy is grounded in the notion of using economic principles as a means towards achieving objectives of economic and social cohesion. In this sector, the production of diverse goods and services has as its aims economic development and the promotion of social wellbeing, rather than making a profit. It thus has a key role to play in society which needs to be properly recognised, encouraged and supported. Can the Commission state: 1. what projects are currently under way or planned with a view to defining the characteristics of this sector in the different Member States, and whether any results, even if preliminary, are available; 2. within what framework and with what monitoring its services are currently dealing with the sector, and what its evaluation is of that framework and monitoring; 3. what specific forms of Community support exist for the sector?
