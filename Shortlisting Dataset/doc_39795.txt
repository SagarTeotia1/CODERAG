ORAL QUESTION H-0491/08 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Rumiana Jeleva to the Commission Subject: Outcome of EU-Egypt subcommittee meeting on 'Political Matters: Human Rights and Democracy' on 2 and 3 June concerning Al-Manar Recognising that the hatred and violent content of Hezbollah’s TV station Al-Manar is in contrast with Article 3b of the Television Without Frontiers Directive - 2007/65/EC (former Art. 22a), all European satellite providers have stopped carrying this channel. Similarly, the broadcasting of Al-Manar via Nilesat is in contradiction with the commitments of Egypt in the EU-Egypt Action Plan, specifically related to the fight against intolerance, discrimination, racism and xenophobia and the promotion of respect for religions and cultures. To what extent did the Commission raise the issue of Al-Manar during the subcommittee meeting and how does the Commission aim to stop Al-Manar from broadcasting the destructive message of hate and terror to Europe via non-European satellite providers?
