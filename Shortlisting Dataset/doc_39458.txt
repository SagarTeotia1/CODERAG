Question for Question Time H-000225/2011 to the Commission Part-session: July 2011 Rule 116 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) Subject: Competition law and public property On 23 September 2010 the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Greek government signed a Memorandum of Understanding, providing, inter alia, for the commercial and residential development of the former Ellinikon airport site. According to press sources, the QIA now intends to withdraw from this particular investment, citing obstacles erected by European competition law. Regardless of the fact that this area should be a 'green lung' for Athens, given the daily degradation of the city's environment by air pollution, and regardless of possible political disagreements about the Greek government's commitment to sell off public assets worth €50 billion, will the Commission say: Have there been any complaints about breaches of EU competition law in the procedure initiated with the QIA? What are, in the Commission's opinion, the correct procedures to be followed in such cases?
