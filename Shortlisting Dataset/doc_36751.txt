means of criminal law sets out a common, EU approach to racism and xenophobia and requires intentional racist and xenophobic conduct to be criminally punishable across all Member States. The framework decision aims at criminalising intentional conduct, such as incitation to violence or hate towards a group of people, or a person belonging to a group, defined on the basis of race, colour, descent, religion or belief, national or ethnic origin, as well as the public condoning, denial or gross trivialisation of crimes against humanity and war crimes. Incitement to violence or hatred will also be punishable if committed by public dissemination or distribution of tracts, pictures or other material. As some Parliamentary scrutiny reservations are still pending, the framework decision has not been formally adopted so far.
