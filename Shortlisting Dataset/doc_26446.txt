2004/C 70 E/275 WRITTEN QUESTION P-3314/03 by Peter Skinner (PSE) to the Commission (3 November 2003) Subject: British Beef Imports into France In December 2001 the European Court of Justice ruled that a ban imposed by the French government on the import of British beef into the country was illegal. The Commission then recommended that France be held liable for substantial fines for non-compliance with the ECJ ruling. With regard to this situation, could the Commission state whether France was held accountable for its actions and has any recompense since been paid? If France avoided the judgement passed down on them could the Commission then explain why this was the case and the amount in fines they should have paid?
