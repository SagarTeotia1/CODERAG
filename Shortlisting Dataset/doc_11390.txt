Question for written answer E-002732/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE) (22 March 2011) Subject: Ukrainian act concerning State support for agriculture The Ukrainian authorities are planning to amend a legislative instrument (the Act on State support for agriculture), with the proposed amendments amounting in practice to the imposition of a State monopoly on the market for the export of food products. Since the measures being considered are inappropriate, in that they do not conform with free market principles, can the Commission state whether it intends to raise this issue in the dialogue with Ukraine?
