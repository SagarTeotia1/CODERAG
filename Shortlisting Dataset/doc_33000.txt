Question for written answer E-007028/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marian Harkin (ALDE) (18 July 2011) Subject: Asian medicines insufficiently taken into account in Directive 2004/24/EC When considering the 359 registrations granted EU-wide by the end of December 2010, the majority are for products which do not contain any whole-plant material and are based on alcohol- or acetone-extracted European single herbs, coming from the relatively recent (20th century) Germanic phytopharmaceutical tradition. Prior to 2004, many of the German products had already received national medicinal licences without undergoing the same quality-control systems as required for registration under Directive 2004/24/EC. It appears that the Traditional Herbal Medicines Products Directive (THMPD) was built around these German products, so they were THMPD-ready when the Directive was enacted. How can this be proportionate, from the perspective of Asian traditional medicines, when the latter undergo such different preparation and manufacturing methods that were not taken into account when the Directive’s eligibility and technical criteria were developed?
