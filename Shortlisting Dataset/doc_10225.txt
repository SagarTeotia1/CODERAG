Question for written answer P-000761/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Estelle Grelier (S&D) (1 February 2011) Subject: Audit and management of ESF projects In May 2010, the system for managing and monitoring ESF projects in the region of Haute Normandie (France) was audited. In accordance with the procedure laid down in the European Financial Regulation, a provisional audit report was drawn up, which included a number of remarks of varying importance. The Financial Regulation provides for a right of reply period, during which the various managers being audited are invited to make remarks or provide additional information, as they have done in this case. However, before even receiving this information, which it is obliged to consider under the procedure, the Commission sent an e-mail asking for all 2010 ESF reimbursement requests for the Haute Normandie regional programme being audited to be disregarded. This unilateral decision makes a mockery of the current suspension procedure. Is the right of reply period not still under way? If so, the suspension procedure is now pointless: by ensuring that no more reimbursements will be made before the end of the right of reply period, there will be nothing to suspend at a later stage. Although I am fully aware that the management of public funds must be beyond reproach, and EU rules must therefore be applied to the letter, I would like to alert the Commission to the serious consequences of this case for the regional council, which is awaiting the reimbursement of EUR 24.4 million and, above all, for those most in need: the final beneficiaries of ESF funding. Could the Commission say on which legislation it based its use of this unreasonable procedure? I would also like to know whether it intends to remedy such situations, both in the short term, as in this case in Haute Normandie, and in the longer term, in the context of its proposed revision of the Financial Regulation (see legislative proposal COM(2010)0815)).
