Monetary and Financial Committee and Development Committee of the IMF and World Bank, also participate in G-20 meetings on an ex-officio basis. The G-20 thus brings together important industrial and emerging-market countries from all regions of the world. Together, member countries represent around 90 per cent of global gross national product, 80 per cent of world trade (including EU intra-trade) as well as two-thirds of the world's population. The G-20's economic weight and broad membership gives it a high degree of legitimacy and influence over the management of the global economy and financial system. Work programme 2009 In 2009, the Commission aims to follow up on the initiatives launched in recent weeks to address the financial crisis and to set out a European framework to address the economic downturn. At the same time, the Commission will use the final year of its mandate to complete the work already under way. On 24 September 2008, Parliament rejected a proposed joint resolution (from the EPP-ED, ALDE and UEN groups) on the European Parliament priorities for the European Commission Work and Legislative Programme 2009 with 102 votes in favour, 306 against and 207 abstentions. All individual group resolutions were also rejected by the House. Among the more controversial issues were the votes on a proposed amendment calling on the Commission to bring forward a raft of proposals for new social legislation as well as an amendment underlining the importance of continuing the accession process with Croatia and Turkey in the expectation that both countries will in due course meet all the criteria for membership.
