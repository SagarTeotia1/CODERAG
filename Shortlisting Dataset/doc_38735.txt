Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (7 June 2011) The Commission considers that workers suffering from injuries and illnesses caused by occupational accidents should be entitled to appropriate compensation. However, leaving aside cases involving intra-EU mobility, the EU has no competence in this field. Any compensation or benefit is therefore a matter for the Member States alone. That is also why the Commission is not in a position to propose legislation in this area.
