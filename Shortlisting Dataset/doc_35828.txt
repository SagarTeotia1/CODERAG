WRITTEN QUESTION P-1777/06 by Jana Hybášková (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 April 2006) Subject: Road safety funding from the Structural Funds The European Commission published on 22 February 2006 figures showing the efforts made in the European Union since 2001 on road safety. According to the press release (IP/06/202), since 2001 and with the European road safety action programme adopted in 2003, the European Union has helped to put road safety at the top of the agenda of the Member States' political concerns. Would the Commission specify in detail the legal base which enables financing of road safety measures in the Member States? Is this funding also currently available for the new Member States, namely the Czech Republic? Would this legal base authorise in principle funding of traffic surveillance technology on the D1 highway in the Czech Republic?
