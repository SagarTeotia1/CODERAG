WRITTEN QUESTION E-6251/07 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 December 2007) Subject: Inadequate information for airline passengers regarding supplementary charges The Greek Ombudsman has recently recommended the introduction by a European airline of new passenger information procedures regarding excess baggage charges. Is the Commission aware of this? Further to my previous question (H‑812/07) Written answer of 13 November 2007. , I should like to know to what extent travel agencies or airline representatives are bound to provide comprehensive information when selling tickets to passengers who do not have access to Internet, setting out in detail excess charges per kilogram. Are consumers being protected from last-minute surprises in the form of supplementary charges of which they are informed at the check-in desk?
