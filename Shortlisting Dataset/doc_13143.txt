WRITTEN QUESTION E-3270/04 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (10 December 2004) Subject: Public consultations by e-mail The Commission is to be congratulated on the fact that it very regularly holds public consultations on a range of subjects. One way in which the Commission can be advised is by means of an e-mail address which exists for the purpose. When using this specific system, what guarantees does the sender of a message have that his comments will genuinely be taken into account, and will the Commission for example automatically mail to each sender an acknowledgement of receipt?
