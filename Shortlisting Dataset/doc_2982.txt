In what ways has the EU, first and foremost through its European External Action Service, been seeking to intervene so as to avert an escalation in the Egyptian conflict? 3. How does the Vice-President/High Representative view the outcome of the Arab Spring in terms of democracy and human rights? Does she have information on which to base an assessment of this kind? 4. What in her opinion should constitute the priorities for the EU?
