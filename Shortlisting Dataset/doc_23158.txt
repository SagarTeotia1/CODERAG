Council on 2 December 2010, it was noted that ‘most Member States stated their will to allow law enforcement agencies to have access to the Eurodac database under very strict rules to strengthen security’. During the Council meeting on 2 December 2010, the Commission took note of this position and offered to ‘address it in a package’ in a way that would have to be acceptable to both the Council and the European Parliament. The consequences of granting law enforcement authorities access to Eurodac can thus only be assessed once proposals are before the Council setting out the forms and the modalities under which such access would be afforded. In the absence thereof, the Council cannot, at this stage, comment on possible legal, data protection or proportionality questions in this regard.
