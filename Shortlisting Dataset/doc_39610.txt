{ "context": [ [ "Automatic test pattern generation", [ "ATPG (acronym for both Automatic Test Pattern Generation and Automatic Test Pattern Generator) is an electronic design automation method/technology used to find an input (or test) sequence that, when applied to a digital circuit, enables automatic test equipment to distinguish between the correct circuit behavior and the faulty circuit behavior caused by defects.", " The generated patterns are used to test semiconductor devices after manufacture, or to assist with determining the cause of failure (failure analysis).", " The effectiveness of ATPG is measured by the number of modeled defects, or fault models, detectable and by the number of generated patterns.", " These metrics generally indicate test quality (higher with more fault detections) and test application time (higher with more patterns).", " ATPG efficiency is another important consideration that is influenced by the fault model under consideration, the type of circuit under test (full scan, synchronous sequential, or asynchronous sequential), the level of abstraction used to represent the circuit under test (gate, register-transfer, switch), and the required test quality." ] ], [ "Alex d'Arbeloff", [ "Alexander Vladimir d'Arbeloff (December 21, 1927 – July 8, 2008) was the American co-founder of Teradyne, a multi-billion dollar Boston, Massachusetts-based manufacturer of automatic test equipment (ATE)." ] ], [ "General Radio", [ "General Radio Company (later, GenRad) was a broad-line manufacturer of electronic test equipment.", " Started in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1915 by Melville Eastham, the company moved to West Concord in the 1950s.", " There, it became a major player in the automatic test equipment (ATE) business, manufacturing a line of testers for assembled printed circuit boards.", " It also produced extensive lines of electrical component measuring equipment, sound and vibration measurement and RLC standards." ] ], [ "Automatic test equipment", [ "Automatic test equipment or automated test equipment (ATE) is any apparatus that performs tests on a device, known as the device under test (DUT), equipment under test (EUT) or unit under test (UUT), using automation to quickly perform measurements and evaluate the test results.", " An ATE can be a simple computer-controlled digital multimeter, or a complicated system containing dozens of complex test instruments (real or simulated electronic test equipment) capable of automatically testing and diagnosing faults in sophisticated electronic packaged parts or on wafer testing, including system on chips and integrated circuits." ] ], [ "Standard Test Data Format", [ "Standard Test Data Format (STDF) is a proprietary file format for semiconductor test information originally developed by Teradyne, but it is now a de facto standard widely used throughout the semiconductor industry.", " It is a commonly used format produced by automatic test equipment (ATE) platforms from companies such as LTX-Credence, Roos Instruments, Teradyne, Advantest, and others." ] ], [ "George Chamillard", [ "George W.
