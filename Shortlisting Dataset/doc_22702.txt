the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks. The Commission will submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council listing and describing the measures on the energy networks which are likely, in the event of an increase in Community financial aid from 10% to 20%, to lead to more rapid completion of the relevant priority projects OJ L 228, 23.9.1995, p. 1. Regulation as amended by European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1655/1999 (OJ L 197, 29.7.1999, p. 1) . . (10) The increase in Community financial aid from 10% to 20% refers only to the developing phase of priority projects Amended proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks ( COM(2002) 134 ), see opinion of the industry committee of 21 May 2002. . Community financial aid for the construction phase should remain very exceptional and should require a special justification. (11) The procedure for identifying projects relating to trans-European energy networks should be adapted by means of action at two levels: a first level identifying a restricted number of thematically defined projects of common interest, and a second level describing projects in detail, referred to as specifications. (12) Since the project specifications determine the use of significant amounts of public funds, the legislator should, for reasons of supervision and transparency, exercise decision-making competence over the said specifications within the framework of the guidelines and criteria laid down in this Decision. (13) The provisions of Decision No 1254/96/EC concerning the committee procedure should be adopted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. . (14) The identification of projects of common interest, their specifications and priority projects should be without prejudice to the results of the environmental impact assessment of the projects and of the plans or programmes. (15) The time-limit within which the Commission has to draw up the periodical report on the implementation of the guidelines under Decision No 1254/96/EC should be extended since, in pursuance of Regulation (EC) No 2236/95, it submits an annual report which contains information on the progress of projects, and in particular that of priority projects. (16) Decision No 1254/96/EC should therefore be amended accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Decision No 1254/96/EC is amended as follows: (1) In Article 3, the first and second indents are replaced by the following: - encouraging effective operation of the internal market in general and of the internal energy market in particular, while encouraging the rational production, distribution and utilization of energy resources and the development and connection of renewable energy resources, so as to reduce the cost of energy to the consumer and contribute to the diversification of energy sources; - facilitating the development and reducing the isolation of the less-favoured regions and the islands of the Community, thereby helping to strengthen
