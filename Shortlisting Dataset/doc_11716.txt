ORAL QUESTION H-0404/09 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2009 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Ivo Belet to the Commission Subject: Combating doping - whereabouts In Belgium, considerable consternation has arisen after tennis players were suspended for one year for failing to correctly complete forms indicating their whereabouts. The whereabouts reporting requirement is in any case a radical measure for 'innocent' sportspeople and gives rise to many questions regarding possible violation of their privacy. Punishing sportspeople with a one-year suspension for reporting their whereabouts inadequately in no way complies with the proportionality principle, as the sportspeople concerned have not in any way resorted to doping. As the only remedy is appeal to the TAS, it is not easy for sportspeople to take up this option. What is the Commission's assessment of this situation in the light of the suspensions in the Meca-Medina case? Does the Commission agree that the severity of the penalty for violations of the 'whereabouts' requirements and the appeal procedure should be better coordinated at European and international level? Will the Commission take measures in this regard?
