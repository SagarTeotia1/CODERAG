Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (17 November 2005) The Commission has already produced interpretative and methodological guidance on the provisions of Article 6 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora relevant to assessing plans and projects that significantly affect Natura 2000 sites Managing Natura 2000 sites: The provisions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC (ISBN 92‑828‑9048‑1) and assessment of plans and projects significantly affecting Natura 2000 sites: Methodological guidance on the provisions of Article 6(3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC (ISBN 92‑828‑1818‑7) http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/nature/nature_conservation/eu_nature_legislation/specific_articles/art6/index_en.htm . This deals, inter alia , with the issue of ‘alternative solutions’ which is one of the conditions of Article 6 that must be met. Satisfying this condition will depend on the individual circumstances of each plan or project and will need to be decided on a case‑by‑case basis. It is for the competent authorities to make such decisions in the light of appropriate assessments. The reference parameters for comparing different possible alternatives should primarily deal with aspects concerning the conservation and maintenance of the integrity of the Natura 2000 site and of its ecological functions. Other non-environmental factors such as important budgetary implications or significant human safety risks would also need to be taken into account with a view to arriving at a solution that is satisfactory and proportionate from an ecological and socioeconomic perspective.
