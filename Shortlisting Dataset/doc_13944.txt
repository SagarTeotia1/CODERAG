WRITTEN QUESTION E-2987/04 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (25 November 2004) Subject: Inclusion of earthquake research in the EU's seventh Framework Programme (FP7) From information obtainable to date on the EU's web page, it emerges that little or no attention is being given to the risk of earthquakes or to seismological research under the new seventh Framework Programme (FP7) to run from 2007, as opposed to the high priority being accorded to research in the fields of space and security and climatic change. The European Seismological Commission is very concerned and its web page calls for more seismological research, particularly in countries such as Greece and Italy, where high levels of seismic activity occur. Does the Commission intend finally to accord high priority to the risk of earthquakes and seismological research under the seventh Framework Programme (/FP7)? Does any other source of funding for seismological research exist or will one be created?
