Question for written answer E-6993/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Filip Kaczmarek (PPE) (8 September 2010) Subject: Increase in cereal prices in the European Union Soaring cereal prices in recent months are causing concern for pig farmers. Higher feed prices mean higher production costs and lower profits. According to Rabobank, the price of wheat has risen by more than 50 % since the end of June this year, and currently stands at EUR 200 per tonne. The price rise has been caused by the floods in central Europe and fires and drought in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Another reason for the price rise is the ban on grain exports from Russia from 15 August until the end of the year. In the EU, smaller cereal harvests are expected in particular in France, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Higher grain prices lead inevitably to higher meat prices. Does the Commission intend to take formal measures to protect pig farmers against the rise in cereal prices in order to avoid another crisis in the EU’s pig production sector of the kind we have seen in recent years?
