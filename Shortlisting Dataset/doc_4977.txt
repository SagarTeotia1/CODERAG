WRITTEN QUESTION E-2138/10 by Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) to the Council (7 April 2010) Subject: Responsibility of States for operation Atalanta escorts On Friday, 19 March 2010 I received the Council's reply to Written Question E‑6050/09 on piracy off the coast of Somalia. The authors of the question specifically wished to know, inter alia , what were the legal implications of using private escorts on some vessels at risk of attack off the coast of Somalia. In its reply, the Council stated that the arrangements for deploying on-board military units and private guards ‘differ considerably, particularly as regards the responsibility of States’. 1. Can the Council say what differences exist as regards the responsibility of States depending on whether the escorts operating on vessels requiring protection are military escorts or are made up of private security guards? 2. Has information on these differences been passed on to the Member States and, in particular, to shipowners and undertakings that have had to opt for private security because their home State has refused to provide military escorts? 3. Has any legal report been drawn up on this subject? If so, could we have access to its content?
