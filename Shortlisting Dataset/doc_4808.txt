Question for written answer E-000769/2012 to the Commission (Vice-President/High Representative) Rule 117 Fiona Hall (ALDE) (31 January 2012) Subject: VP/HR — EUBAM Rafah Mission The answer to Written Question E‑007913/2011 given by the Vice-President/High Representative on 10 October 2011 showed that the European Union has expended some EUR 9.5 million on the EU common security and defence mission EUBAM Rafah during the period from July 2007 to date (some 62 % of the total expenditure on that mission). There is, however, little evidence to suggest that the mission was able to fulfil its mandate during that period. — In light of this, could the Vice-President/High Representative explain the ongoing political justification for the continuation of that mission? — Could the Vice-President/High Representative confirm whether alternative uses of these resources which would better contribute to an improvement of the situation of the people of Gaza have been considered? — If so, could the Vice-President/High Representative indicate what alternatives have been considered, and why have they been rejected?
