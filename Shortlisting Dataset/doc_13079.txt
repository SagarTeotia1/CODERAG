WRITTEN QUESTION E-2813/06 by Bernat Joan i Marí (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (28 June 2006) Subject: Impact of the Ibiza road plan on archaeological heritage The island of Ibiza is densely covered in priceless archaeological sites from Carthaginian, Roman and Arab times. The road and motorways plan takes no account of the drawing-up of a rigorous, objective study of the soil’s archaeological wealth. In this connection, I have evidence that when the archaeological team refused to give their go-ahead to the plan, the authorities decided to ignore the archaeological assessment and begin implementing the construction work. Does the Commission believe that an infrastructure project on this scale can be implemented without a rigorous study of its impact on archaeological heritage?
