WRITTEN QUESTION E-0143/06 by María Sornosa Martínez (PSE) to the Commission (24 January 2006) Subject: Pollution of drinking water by nitrates from farming in L'Eliana and Ribarroja del Turia Water pollution is a growing problem, as can be seen, inter alia , from the increase in concentrations of nitrates in both surface water and groundwater. One of the sources contributing to water pollution is the inappropriate use of nitrogen fertilisers in farming. In April 2004 the residents' association of Montesol and the surrounding area, in L'Eliana, together with the residents' association of Clot, submitted an application to the Environment Commissioner protesting and warning against the violation of the directive on the pollution of water for human consumption by nitrates, since the municipalities concerned were not complying with the conditions governing potability and quality. Does the Commission believe that the Valencian government is contravening European water directives, since it is failing to eliminate the effects of nitrates on water for human consumption in L'Eliana and Ribarroja del Turia, areas which have already been declared vulnerable to nitrate pollution? Does the Commission not take the view that prompt and definitive action should be taken to ensure that water for public consumption in this area once again meets the conditions governing potability and quality laid down by Community legislation for all European citizens, by developing and implementing schemes for the drinking water treatment of surface water and thereby avoiding groundwater as the main source of supply?
