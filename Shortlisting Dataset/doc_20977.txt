Question for written answer E-010597/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Daciana Octavia Sârbu (S&D) (20 December 2010) Subject: Marine litter in the Black Sea Marine litter is a significant and growing problem in many areas of ocean around the world. The consequences are varied and far reaching, ranging from environmental effects on marine life and ecosystems to the economic effects of damage to fishing vessels and port infrastructure. Tourism in coastal regions is also threatened. In its 2007 communication on the Black Sea Synergy initiative (COM(2007)0160), the Commission stated its commitment to EU accession to the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution, to which Romania and Bulgaria — the only EU states bordering on the Black Sea — are already signatories. Are any detailed assessments available of the environmental and/or economic effects of marine litter in the Black Sea? Does the Commission consider that the abovementioned Convention is effective in providing the environmental protection it was intended to deliver? Does it offer an appropriate framework within which to address the problem of marine litter? If the Convention (and its implementation) are not sufficient, what other frameworks and/or strategies could be pursued in order to deal with the problem of marine litter?
