WRITTEN QUESTION E-4514/06 by Corien Wortmann-Kool (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 October 2006) Subject: Future of Regulation (EEC) No 11/1960 At the beginning of 2006, various organisations became concerned about the possible repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 11 of 1960 OJ 52, 16.8.1960 , p. 1121. . The purpose of this regulation was to make it possible to combat unfair competition, particularly where such competition arose from pricing. In order to be able to enforce the relevant rules, a transport document was made compulsory, which was to contain information, inter alia , about the consignor, the nature and weight of the goods and freight rates. Particularly in inland shipping, where transport documents are checked regularly for other purposes (namely safety), this regulation is currently the subject of debate. In connection with plans for deregulation, Regulation (EEC) No 11/1960 was mentioned at the beginning of 2006 as a candidate for repeal. Its repeal would rightly do away with an outdated system relating to freight rates and price competition. At the same time, consideration ought to be given to whether the advantages of having a bill of lading in the interests of safety could be secured in some other way. 1. In view of the outdated objective of combating unfair competition, is it desirable to repeal the regulation? What view does the Commission take of the simultaneous abolition of the compulsory bill of lading? 2. Could the introduction of a compulsory European bill of lading for all container transport help to control safety risks in the logistic chain? Why did the Commission not include this in the proposal for a regulation (COM(2006)79) on enhancing supply chain security? 3. What scope is there for introducing a compulsory bill of lading for all container transport at this relatively late stage? Will the Commission initiate a debate on introducing a compulsory bill of lading for container transport?
