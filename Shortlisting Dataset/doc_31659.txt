Question for written answer E-011130/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antonyia Parvanova (ALDE) (30 November 2011) Subject: Regulation enacted by Financial Supervisory Commission in breach of EC law and of competition rules enshrined in EU Treaty On 3 November 2010 Bulgaria’s Financial Supervisory Commission adopted amendments to Regulation No 27 of 29 March 2006 on procedures for constituting insurers’ and reinsurers’ technical reserves and health insurance reserves. The amendments took effect on 12 November 2010. Among the changes introduced was a new stipulation (Regulation No 27, Article 11(9)) that the total figure for administrative and brokerage expenses included in drivers’ third-party liability insurance plans should not exceed 20 % of the cost of the insurance premium net of all statutory charges and taxes and discount. This new measure regulating the level of insurers’ administrative and brokerage expenses is in breach of EC law (Article 49 of the EC Treaty, Article 9 of Directive 92/49 amending Directives 73/239 EEC and 88/357/EEC, and Article 15 of First Council Directive 73/239/EEC) and of the principles of a free and competitive services market. Moreover, the Financial Supervision Commission made the regulatory changes without fulfilling its duty to conduct a thorough economic impact assessment (cost-benefit analysis) of the type required when EU regulations are amended. Reducing insurers’ commission fees is bound to result in a large number of brokers withdrawing from the third-party liability market and in a reduction in cover, which, in turn, will lead the Commission to impose penalties on Bulgaria. Is the Commission aware of the new stipulations and does it consider the regulation thus amended to be consistent with the principles of free competition? Does the Commission consider that this regulation is in breach of EC law and the EU Treaty?
