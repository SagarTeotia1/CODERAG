Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (15 March 2012) Fish stocks in EU waters are monitored by scientists of Member States collaborating and working through the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean (GFCM). Most fish stocks are monitored annually. As necessary, additional advice is provided by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), whilst ensuring in this context that no overlap takes place between the activities of ICES and GFCM and STECF. This monitoring depends on national catch reports of Member States, biological sampling of landings and discards, and extensive surveying of marine resources by research vessels using standardised fishing gear, hydroacoustic surveys or other specialised methods. The Commission supports international monitoring by co-financing the collection of biological sampling data at a rate of 50 % under the data collection framework, by funding the scientific advisory programmes of ICES, the activities of STECF, and contributes to the funding of GFCM. The results of this monitoring are posted at www.ices.dk, www.gfcm.org and https://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu
