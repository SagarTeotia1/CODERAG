budgetary powers and prerogatives will be respected. Specifically, the declaration ensures that, based on the assumption that the two countries join in 2007, the classification entered in the annex of the accession treaties will be deemed as non-compulsory expenditure after 2009. The financing of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will not jeopardise existing multiannual programmes. Finally, the financing of the accession will be made without prejudice to the decisions on the next financial perspective. The full joint declaration is as follows: Joint Declaration agreed between the Council Presidency and the EP negotiating delegation Financial implications of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania 1. Without prejudice of the draft treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe a. The representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting with the Council declare that the amounts in Title III "Financial Provisions" of the Act of Accession, annexed to the draft Accession Treaty submitted under the assent procedure of the European Parliament, are mentioned without prejudice to the European Parliament's rights and the powers and prerogatives of the budgetary authority conferred by Article 272 the EC Treaty and the relevant provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999. b. The Council, the Commission and the European Parliament confirm that the classification of the expenditure in Articles 30-34, Title III "Financial Provisions" of the Act of Accession, annexed to the draft Accession Treaty will constitute non-compulsory expenditure after 2009. 2. The Commission confirms that its proposal for a financial framework (2007-2013) is based on the assumption that Bulgaria and Romania will be Member States on 1 January 2007. The European Parliament and the Council take note of the indicative amounts, for Bulgaria and Romania, provided by the Commission in March 2004 and considered by the Council in its conclusions of 22 March 2004 on "the financial package for the accession negotiations for Bulgaria and Romania". The financing of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will be ensured without jeopardising the commitments for existing multiannual programmes and the decisions on the next financial perspectives. 3. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission recall the importance of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 in the functioning of budgetary procedures and that this can only function if all the institutions comply fully.
