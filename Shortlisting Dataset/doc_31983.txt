Question for written answer E-006554/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (11 July 2011) Subject: Dramatic cuts in the aid programme for the most deprived persons As announced on 20 June 2011, the total amount of money allocated to programme for the supply of food for the most deprived persons in the EU for 2012 has been set at EUR 113 million, compared to the EUR 500 million provided annually so far. The main reason for this sharp drop is an ECJ ruling which states that the aid programme must come only from EU public stocks. At a time when the risk of poverty due to the economic crisis is becoming more acute and given that more than 43 million people in the EU are at risk from suffering from food shortages, it is surprising that the Council has twice previously rejected Commission proposals to address the problem of the underfunding of this programme. In view of the above, will the Council say: 1. Why is it refusing to give its consent and help find the resources needed to maintain the level of funding for the programme at pre‑2012 levels? 2. What approach will it take to prevent this dramatic decline in funding of the programme, especially during the current economically unstable period?
