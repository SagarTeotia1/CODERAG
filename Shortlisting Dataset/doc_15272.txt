WRITTEN QUESTION E-4442/09 by Jim Higgins (PPE) to the Commission (21 September 2009) Subject: Restraints on EU airlines for children with disabilities Could the Commission indicate what measures it is taking to ensure a uniform system of child restraint systems are used for children with disabilities on board EU airlines? Is the Commission concerned that the lack of standardisation currently in place means that families are severely inconvenienced and in some cases unable to travel due to the lack of appropriate rules or clear and uniform restraint systems used by EU airlines?
