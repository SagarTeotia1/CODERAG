Reply (22 November 2010) The Council is fully aware of the events in the region of Halabja in 1988. The Council is also aware that living conditions in Iraq are extremely challenging for large parts of the population. The Council is not in possession of the information referred to by the Honourable Member. The difficult security situation and the lack of reliable basic services affect the Iraqi population at large. Against this background, the EU does not single out specific regions or communities for support. The EU's support to Iraq since 2003 amounted to just over 1 billion euros in grants, covering both reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. Key sectors of support have been basic services (Education, Water and Sanitation, Infrastructure and Health). The support has been based on Iraqi priorities, as laid down in the National Development Strategy and in the International Compact for Iraq. In line with this approach, the Union has been co-funding through the United Nations Iraq Trust Fund (UN ITF) of the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) two programmes which include a number of activities taking place in Halabja and its region: a school reconstruction programme (programme B1‑22 of the UN ITF) and a Local Area Development Programme (programme C10‑09 of the UN ITF). Halabja was also included in several health sector programmes of the IRFFI, which focus mainly on the rehabilitation and improvement of basic health services and prevention of epidemics through vaccination campaigns. In providing assistance to Iraq the EU works very closely with the Iraqi government. The EU will continue to do so as it develops its assistance programme in accordance with Iraqi priorities.
