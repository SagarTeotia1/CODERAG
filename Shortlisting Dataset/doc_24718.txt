WRITTEN QUESTION E-0805/08 by Vittorio Agnoletto (GUE/NGL) and Roberto Musacchio (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (18 February 2008) Subject: Extension granted by the Commission for the use of asbestos in industrial production The Commission has decided to extend the derogation on the prohibition on the placing on the market and use of asbestos fibres and products to which such fibres are added intentionally (see Directive 1999/77/EC OJ L 207, 6.8.1999, p. 18. ). That extension, which was due to lapse on 1 January 2008, was justified on the basis of the work conducted in July 2006 at a meeting with the enterprises concerned. The results from July 2007 showed that there are only asbestos substitutes for high voltage equipment, and not for low-voltage equipment. The working meetings were attended by the enterprises concerned and the respective Member States. The Commission decided to extend the derogation despite the fact that no favourable opinion was issued by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) or the European Consumers’ Organisation (BEUC). Does the Commission not consider the assessments in favour of the extension that emerged from the working meetings of 12 July 2006 and 3 July 2007 to be biased, in that they were made solely by the enterprises concerned and the countries to which they belong? Does the Commission not feel that despite the lack of dialogue with workers’ associations, consumer organisations and environmental organisations in general, the interests of industry are being placed before those of the health of workers and the public? Does it not consider this issue to raise questions as to the transparency of the process to which that decision relates?
