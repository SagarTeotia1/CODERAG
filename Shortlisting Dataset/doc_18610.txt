constituting as it does by far the largest economic area and the area with the most entities applying IFRS; believes that all trustees of the IASB should come from nations that have signed up, or intend to sign up, to IFRS; 5. Notes the increasingly theoretical dimension of IASB projects, the complexity and theoretical nature of which are such that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, are not always able to follow them; 6. Notes, furthermore, that practical business aspects are not adequately reflected by the IASB; considers that, from a user's perspective, the financial statement presentation for accounting does not always lend itself to other uses, e.g. for the purposes of providing financial information to investors, performance monitoring or financial management; 7. Believes that there should be an open debate about accountancy standards; to this end, believes that the IASB should strengthen its due process as regards stakeholders so that the views of all IFRS users and investors are taken into account; 8. Takes the view, however, that governance and accountability must be improved through the following measures: (a) by setting up a public oversight body involving all IASCF/ IASB public stakeholders including in particular legislators and supervisors; and setting up a body allowing representative market participants, including preparers and users from jurisdictions where IFRS is mandatory, to deliver annually a report on the functioning of international accounting standard setting to the governing bodies of the IASCF/IASB; (b) such a body could be responsible for selecting and appointing the trustees in a transparent procedure ensuring both the competences of the candidates and a balanced representation of stakeholders; this would help make the appointment procedure more transparent and significantly enhance the legitimacy of the trustees; (c) a guarantee that the composition of the IASB, the Standards Advisory Council (SAC) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) is improved and that the trustees ensure that the appointment procedure is transparent and due account is taken of the interests of various interest groups; (d) increased involvement of the trustees in supervising the IASB and its work plan, in particular as regards the way in which the work plan is drawn up and the way in which mandates are granted to the IASB; (e) that the IASCF constitution should ensure that the IASB develops accounting solutions that are not only technically correct but also reflect what is necessary and possible from the point of view of all users (investors and supervisors) and preparers; (f) carrying out impact assessments for all projects, so as to check the costs and benefits (including those for user firms) of draft texts and, in particular, to highlight the implications for financial stability; 9. Notes that in the abovementioned combined statement the Commission seeks – as it did when it concluded a roadmap with the US authorities in April 2006 – to pre-empt solutions where it would be preferable, in the interests of effectiveness and legitimacy, to have an open consultation process and debate, to which this resolution could be a contribution; 10. Urges that improvements to accountability and
