programmed framework agreed with the country in question, often financing institutions of that country in areas such as 'good governance', strengthening of justice systems, police systems etc. 9. The question of a lack of coordination between the two has often been raised, as has the question of insufficient coordination with EU Member States and with other donors and international organisations. 10. As for the EIDHR, following the adoption of the legal bases in 1999 These two regulations are virtually identical but one covers 'developing countries' (adopted in co-decision) and the other covers 'third countries (adopted under consultation). , some budgetary consolidation took place in terms of budget lines and nomenclature. Since that time, the budgetary trend for the EIDHR has been fairly stable and the programme has been given high priority and visibility in the budget procedure. Commitment appropriations for chapter 19 04 have been voted as follows (not including any subsequent transfers). It should be noted that the 2007 PDB figure may not be directly comparable to previous years as the budget nomenclature changes. (EUR million) PDB 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 130,7 122,7 120,4 125,6 106,0 104,0 102,0 94,8 Are any new actions included, other than the EIDHR of previous years? For 2006, more than EUR 105 million out of this is entered on the main line 19 04 03: Development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law - Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms the other lines of the EIDHR are: 19 04 01: European Inter-university Centre (Venice), 19 04 02: Support for the victims of human rights abuses, 19 04 04: Support for the International Criminal Court, 19 04 05: Preparatory action to establish a conflict-prevention network 11. It could be noted that the level slightly above 100 million in fact corresponded to the indicative financial envelopes included in the two Council Regulations. The "jump" in funding in 2004 was decided by the Parliament (against the proposals of Commission and Council) and was actually possible since the programme was not fully co-decided. 12. The EIDHR's main budget line (19 04 03) is implemented following calls for proposals and centres around four main 'campaigns". A number of recipient countries have also been chosen, but it is not clear according to which criteria. 13. The EIDHR, perhaps less known, also provides some direct funding to international organisations. This is often criticised by the NGOs. They question why an instrument like the EIDHR should provide core funding for the Office of the High Commissioner for HR in Geneva (UN) ? Or "targeted projects" to support to UN projects? 14. It should be emphasised that for the period 2007-2013, the Parliament has insisted that a separate legislative proposal for a Democracy and Human Rights Instrument be presented. This will need to be financed under the global agreement for heading 4 of the new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) as agreed by the budgetary authority. 15. The Commission's PDB 2007 presents the human rights actions separately (chapter 19 04) in terms of budget nomenclature, but as part of
