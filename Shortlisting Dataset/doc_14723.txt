WRITTEN QUESTION E-2335/09 by Syed Kamall (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (7 April 2009) Subject: Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan A number of my constituents inform me that, since 28 January 2009, four children belonging to the Ahmadi Muslim faith have been arrested in Pakistan on the false allegation of insulting the Prophet of Islam. I am informed that they are being held in poor conditions. My constituents inform me that Pakistan, which is a signatory to and has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is in prima facie breach of at least Articles 14 and 37. I am told that these children have been held under Section 295-C of the Penal Code, the punishment for which is either death or 25 years' imprisonment. Is the European Commission aware of this alleged injustice? Has the Commission raised this issue with the Pakistani Government?
