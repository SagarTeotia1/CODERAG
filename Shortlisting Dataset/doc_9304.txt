Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (23 December 2011) The EU-funded ‘Preparatory study on food waste across EU-27’ BIO Intelligence Service, October 2010 — http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/reports.htm estimates that 45 % of the total amount of food waste generated in Europe in 2006 was disposed of to landfills. This is about 40 million tonnes. The study also estimates that as a result of policy measures Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste (OJ L 182, 16.7.1999) gradually limits the amount of biodegradable municipal waste allowed to be landfilled. Directive 2008/98/EC on waste (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3.) sets 50 % recycling target for household waste to be achieved by 2020. , there will be 36 million tonnes less food waste going to landfills in the EU‑27 in 2020 compared to 2006, based on the assumption that all policy targets are met. The Commission has no information about the costs of storage of food waste in EU and per country.
