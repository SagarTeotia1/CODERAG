Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (2 July 2007) 1. The Bolivian Minister of the Presidency, Ramón Quintana, visited Brussels in early May 2007 in order to inform the Commission about the Government’s handling of its intended re-acquisition of shares in Entel S.A. which are held by Euro Telecom International NV, a Dutch holding company owned 100 % by Telecom Italia. The Commission welcomed this initiative. The Commission emphasised that investors need legal certainty, and stressed that any rules and procedures which are in place at a given time should be adhered to and any relevant negotiations should be conducted without any appearance of intimidation. The Commission expressed the hope that the negotiations between the Bolivian authorities and Telecom Italia would be constructive and would lead to a mutually satisfactory outcome fully in keeping with the relevant legal framework and having taken into account the legitimate interests of both parties. Mr Quintana agreed to keep the Commission informed of any relevant developments. 2. The Commission is committed to strengthening relations between the EU and the Andean Community in line with the conclusions of the EU‑Andean Community Ministerial Meeting held in Santo Domingo on 19 April 2007. The Commission believes that an association agreement between the two regions would provide the EU with an improved legal framework for its investments in the Andean region. 3. The Commission will continue to monitor closely the situation concerning EU investments in Bolivia. The Commission will take any relevant opportunities to contribute to the development of a favourable environment for EU investment in Bolivia and to highlight the positive contribution which it can make to the economic and social development of Bolivia.
