Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (19 June 2007) The Commission is not aware of the exact wording on the statement of the ambassador but notes that the ambassador was also stressing the need of a dialogue between Italy and China after the incident (Xinhua News Agency, 16 April 2007). The European Commission is a strong supporter of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its principles. It is cooperating with China in the WTO context and is in close contact with the Chinese authorities in cases where it considers China as not abiding to WTO rules. A sound commercial relationship between the EU and China is in the interest of both sides.
