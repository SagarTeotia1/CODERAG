Question for written answer P-5136/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Salvatore Iacolino (PPE) (1 July 2010) Subject: Doping in sports In a number of Member States, the sports disciplinary bodies have imposed penalties such as suspension from involvement in competitions on participants, including a number of leading sportsmen and -women in various fields whose drug tests were found to be positive. Consumption of doping substances is on the increase among young people and is widespread both in competitions at the highest level and in amateur sports. The Internet is now the main means of selling and acquiring such doping substances, prohibited drugs and illegally supplied pharmaceutical products. The illegal market in doping substances is expanding despite the steps taken to combat the problem, particularly in the European Union. While doping is used in an attempt to improve physical condition or enhance endurance, it can also cause serious damage to health and even impair the functioning of the body. Will the Commission clarify what it has done and will do: 1. to introduce new arrangements for monitoring doping substances, drawing up a list of concrete measures, with the support of professionals, associations, including amateur sports organisations, and civil society? 2. to ensure closer cooperation with the competent national and regional bodies in order to acquire a better understanding of doping in sports and provide guidelines on measures to prevent and combat the problem? 3. to introduce measures restricting Internet sales and purchases of illegal doping substances, including through closer judicial and police cooperation between Member States and non-EU countries?
