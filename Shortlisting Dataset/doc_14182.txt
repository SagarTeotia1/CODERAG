WRITTEN QUESTION E-4714/09 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (7 October 2009) Subject: Maasai evictions in Tanzania Is the Commission aware of the evictions and human rights abuses currently taking place in Loliondo Division, Ngorongoro District, Tanzania? Since July 2009 tens of thousands of people along with their cattle have been forcibly evicted from eight villages by the police to make way for hunting by the Ortello Business Corporation (OBC). The land in question was granted to OBC by the former President, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, in 1993 and the local communities were not party to the agreement or any meaningful consultation. The agreement denies pastoralist communities grazing and watering rights on their own land and is in direct contravention of the Village Land Act of 1999. Courts have not been involved in orders for eviction or demolition of property. Civil society and human rights activists who lobby for the communities rights are harassed and intimidated. What steps is the Commission taking to ensure that the rights of those evicted are being upheld? In addition, what steps has the Commission taken to put an end to the violence and ensure that those affected by the evictions are able to return to their ancestral homes and be compensated for their losses as a result of the evictions?
