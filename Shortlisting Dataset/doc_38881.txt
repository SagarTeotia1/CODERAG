Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2008) Death threats, hatred, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are incompatible with the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, upon which the European Union is founded. Member States should ensure that these principles fully apply by taking all necessary steps, including judicial actions in case of their violation. As regards the possible link between the case referred to by the Honourable Member and Community law, the Commission points out that the ‘TV without frontiers’ Directive Directive 97/36/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 amending Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, OJ L 202, 30.7.1997. provides in Article 22a that ‘Member States shall ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality’. This directive has been transposed by Bulgarian Law on radio and television Bulgarian Law on Radio and Television published in the State Gazette nr 138 of 14 November 1998. and must be fully applied by the relevant Bulgarian authorities. The Commission will contact the Bulgarian authorities for information on this matter.
