Answer given by Mr Lewandowski on behalf of the Commission (20 April 2010) This pilot project has been entered into the budget 2009 by the European Parliament with a budget of EUR 1.5 million both in commitments and in payments. The Commission had indeed welcomed this pilot project as this issue of assessing the costs of compliance with the EU legislation on farmers is very relevant. In its first report on the implementation of Pilot Projects and Preparatory Actions for 2009 presented on 27 February 2009, the Commission detailed its interpretation of the pilot project and proposed to undertake it in two years given the large scope of the project, starting with data collection and field work during the first period. The Commission launched the call for tender on 18 July 2009. Following this publication of the open call for tenders, the Commission received only one offer in response to this call. In view of the value of the tender and the need to ensure genuine competition, the Commission felt obliged to cancel the procurement procedure. The Commission is conscious of the importance of the costs that farmers face to comply with EU legislation. It will take this element into account in its reflections on the future of the common agricultural policy.
