legislator is a sine qua non for good governance and that keeping interested parties informed of the Council's legislative work is the basic precondition for improving understanding and increasing participation on the part of the general public; 21. Stresses once again in this connection the need for the Council to hold its meetings in public when acting in a legislative capacity; in such cases, debates and votes must be made public; pursuant to the Council's Rules of Procedure, public debates must take place at the start and at the end of all legislative procedures, and the results of votes and explanations of votes by Members of the Council must be published; 22.

Considers that greater involvement of the regional and local authorities in Union policy White Paper 3.1. should rather be achieved by enlisting expertise and experience at regional and local level in the Member States at an early stage in the preparation of legislation, there being nothing to prevent the Commission from asking the Committee of the Regions, as a forum for the regions and local authorities, for appropriate surveys and opinions at an early stage, in particular with respect to the anticipated follow-up costs of legislative proposals at the relevant level See study commissioned by Parliament on regulatory impact analysis (RIA) and the report on grassroots representation adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 20.9.2000 (CdR 436/2000). ; 28.
