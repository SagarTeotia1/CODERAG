Question for written answer E-011137/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Isabelle Durant (Verts/ALE) and Claude Turmes (Verts/ALE) (13 January 2011) Subject: Rail link between Brussels and Strasbourg The Commission has recently decided to reduce its participation in the financing of two projects to modernise the high-speed rail line between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which would substantially improve transport links between these three ‘capitals’ of the European Union. These upgrading works are on the list of major trans-European transport network (TEN‑T) projects, but no longer appear to be a priority issue for the EU. For what reasons has the Commission decided to reduce EU funding for these works? Have talks been held with the Member States concerned? Does the Commission still consider the rail link between Brussels and Strasbourg to be a priority European project, given that it would improve — by means of an environmentally friendly mode of transport — coordination between the three places of work of the European institutions? Furthermore, does the Commission not think that passenger services (catering, wireless Internet, etc.) on this line are in need of substantial improvement? Would it not be preferable to have a range of on-board services comparable to that on high-speed lines in other European countries? What specific steps does the Commission intend to take to facilitate progress with regard to the upgrading of this key rail route?
