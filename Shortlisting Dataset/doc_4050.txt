WRITTEN QUESTION E-5886/08 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (5 November 2008) Subject: Interim employment In its most recent report on the matter, submitted under the codecision procedure, the Commission indicates that it is seeking the adoption of a uniform EU directive on interim employment. Does the Commission consider this advisable, in view of the fact that Member States are currently free to decide on framework employment conditions? If so, what view does it take of the deregulation of labour relations and to what extent does it consider the addition of the regulatory umbrella to existing local legislative frameworks to be in the interest of workers? Does this decision not encroach upon the existing legislative frameworks in the Member States?
