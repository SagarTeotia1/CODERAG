WRITTEN QUESTION E-2727/07 by Margrietus van den Berg (PSE) to the Commission (30 May 2007) Subject: The rights of children with disabilities in developing countries According to Unicef (April 2007), children with disabilities are among the most stigmatised and excluded of all the world’s children. Misunderstanding and fear of children with disabilities result in their marginalisation within their family, community, at school, and in the wider society. The discrimination they suffer leads to poor health, affects their self-esteem, limits their access to education and puts them at higher risk of violence, abuse and neglect. This is particularly the case for disabled children in developing countries. 1. How is the European Commission going to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities in developing countries — and in particular their access to basic services such as health, education and protection from abuse — are going to be incorporated in the framework of the European strategy for the rights of the child and more specifically in the action plan on children in development cooperation? 2. What programmes is the European Commission planning to develop and implement which will support activities and initiatives to monitor the human rights situation of children with disabilities living in developing countries, and assist those children with disabilities who are particularly vulnerable to human rights abuse and marginalisation?
