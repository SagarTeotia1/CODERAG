1999/C 348 E/064 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0358/99 by Paul Rübig (PPE) to the Commission (1 March 1999) Subject: Survey of crime in European cities A current survey of serious crime in Austria, Germany and Switzerland shows that crime rates in the Austrian capital, Vienna, are clearly lower than in German or Swiss cities. For example, a figure of 3,9 murders per 100 000 inhabitants is given for Vienna in 1997. A similar trend is also revealed by the number of robberies where Vienna's figure of 82 per 100 000 inhabitants is clearly lower than other major cities. Does there exist a representative survey for all major cities in the European Union showing which urban centres require particular action to be taken to make them safe areas for citizens of the Union? If not, when does the Commission plan to arrange for such a survey?
