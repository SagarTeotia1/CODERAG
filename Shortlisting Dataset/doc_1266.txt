results of elections to the European Parliament coincide in time. Parliamentary immunity should take effect as of the proclamation of the election results and should cover all actions undertaken by Members in exercising their mandate including those undertaken after the last session of the European Parliament. IV. Conclusion On the basis of the above considerations and pursuant to Article 6a(2) of the Rules of Procedure, after consideration of the reasons for and against upholding the Member’s immunity, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market recommends that the European Parliament uphold the parliamentary immunity of Mr Francesco Musotto.
