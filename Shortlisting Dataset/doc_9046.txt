Answer given by Mr Orban on behalf of the Commission (2 April 2008) All the Commission's initiatives regarding teaching and training come under the Lifelong Learning Programme, which has a budget of around seven billion euro for the period from 2007 to 2013. Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity is one of the specific aims of this programme and takes the form of a series of schemes in the various sectors: Comenius for school education, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci for vocational training, and Grundtvig for the training of adults. The intersectoral aspect includes a Key Activity ‘Languages’ devoted entirely to language learning and promoting linguistic diversity. The total budget for the programme was set by the budget authority, which is the only authority empowered to change the amount. Furthermore, the Commission's newly developed Job Mobility Action Plan 2007‑10 COM(2007)773 final. aimed at, among other things, tackling obstacles to mobility and therefore preparing people for mobility through language learning. Under actions 5, 6 and 7 of this Action Plan, Member States are encouraged: — to incorporate mobility requirements into national employment strategy and lifelong learning schemes; — to urge regional and local authorities and other stakeholders to remove remaining practical obstacles to mobility (language being acknowledged as a major obstacle); — to learn from good practice from the mobility actions financed under the EU's cohesion policy, and in particular the European Social Fund, which supports language training activities. As part of the action plan an inventory of existing financial support schemes for mobility will be established which will therefore include language training schemes for mobility purposes. This will allow for a better understanding of the potential needs.
