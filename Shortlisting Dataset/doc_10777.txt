Answer given by Ms Wallström on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2008) In addition to the reply given to the Honourable Member's previous Written Question E‑1297/08 , the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that the Commission adopted an Internet strategy SEC(2007)1742. in order to overhaul the Europa site — one of the biggest in the world, and to encourage interest in EU issues on other websites with a view to broadening the debate on the European Union. The Commission has also adopted an Audio-Visual Strategy SEC(2008)506/2. to facilitate a greater coverage of EU issues on existing and new audiovisual platforms; to encourage audiovisual media professionals to create and take part in European audiovisual networks, while retaining full editorial independence; and to increase the Commission's own production and dissemination of videos and documentaries to illustrate or explain EU policies. The Commission is also working on new initiatives including launching a call for proposals for Europe Direct information relays. New management partnerships with a number of Member States are being finalised in 2008, and negotiations are underway to further extend the scheme in 2009.
