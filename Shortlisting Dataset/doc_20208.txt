Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (17 January 2008) The Commission follows closely the situation in Gaza, including the situation of Human Rights there. Following the takeover of control in Gaza by Hamas in June 2007, the General Affairs and External Relations Council stated that all those responsible for criminal acts in violation of the standars safeguarded by international humanitarian law and of fundamental human rights must be held accountable. Gaza remains an integral part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Commission supports the efforts of the Palestinian Authority to restore its legitimacy there.
