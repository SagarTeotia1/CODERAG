WRITTEN QUESTION E-2662/07 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (24 May 2007) Subject: Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy procedure for stainless steel bars In February 2007 the US Department of Commerce launched its five-year (‘sunset’) review of countervailing duties on imports of stainless steel bars from, inter alia , the EU. The products in question had been subject to an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy procedure introduced in 2002 with the imposition of duties which varied from one firm to another but were in any event fairly substantial. The procedure, as the Commission knows, was flawed by the application of ‘zeroing’ when calculating dumping margins, and the complaint the European Community filed with the relevant WTO body was upheld for that reason. Consequently the duties continued to apply to those companies which had failed to cooperate in the course of the investigation. Yet that failure to cooperate was caused, in many cases, by the exorbitant legal costs involved for the European firms in question. In view of previous investigations carried out by the US authorities, and the type of inquiries conducted by them in some cases, as shown in the Commission's report on trade defence measures adopted by third countries against imports from the European Union, a subject on which I drafted the European Parliament's opinion, 1. Would the Commission monitor the progress of the investigations being carried out by the US authorities of imports of stainless steel bars, so as to ensure that the investigative procedures and outcomes comply with the rules laid down on the subject by the WTO? 2. Would the Commission provide all the European firms which request it with the necessary technical assistance, or at least with full and accurate information about a subject which, as the Commission is well aware, is highly technical and difficult to understand?
