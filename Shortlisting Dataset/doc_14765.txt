responsible for data protection, but these demands have not been met till now Moraes Report on the initiative by the grand duchy of Luxembourg with a view to adopting a Council decision adjusting the basic salaries and allowance applicable to Europol Staff (5429/2005-C C6-0037/2005 -2005/0803 (CNS), A6‑0139/2005 , p.6 . The protocol The Protocol Official Journal C 002 , 06/01/2004 P. 0001 - 0012 amending the Convention on the Establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention), Council Act of 27 November 2003. dealt with some of these issues such as providing for the right of access to Europol documents ibid., art. 32 (a) par. 17, p. 7. , informing the European Parliament according to the consultation procedure and the possibility for the Presidency or its representative and the Director of Europol to appear before the European Parliament in order to discuss general questions related to Europol ibid., art.34, par. 18, p. 7. . Despite some elements of transparency inserted in the Protocol, although not yet ratified, it is clear that the current impossibility for the European Parliament to be involved on an equal basis with the Council in the nomination and dismissal process of the Europol Director clearly shows insufficient Parliamentary control on Europol. Europol's engagement to send information to the European Parliament the general report on Europol activities in the previous year, the Europol's future activities report and the five-years financing plan has not yet been met ibid., art. 28 (10) and art. 35 (4). . This situation does not seem satisfactory. One could claim that Europol is a European intelligence service Work Programme 2007, Europol, The Hague 31 March 2006, p. 3. and therefore should give priority to security rather than transparency. However, by looking at its mission statement it is clear that this body provides essentially an information and analysis system without having executive powers. In the so-called Area of freedom, security and justice, such an imbalance between security goals and transparency is no longer acceptable. Conclusions Europol can be a very useful support to the Member States law enforcement authorities in preventing and combating serious forms of international organised crime. However, for the reasons stated above, the European Parliament criticises the lack of sufficient democratic control, transparency and accountability of this body at both national and European levels. Your rapporteur strongly argues for the reform of the organisation and working system of Europol in such a way that will provide the European Parliament with the necessary instruments to supervise Europol activities to guarantee the democratic control that our institution is there to secure. It is for this reason, and in keeping with the Parliament’s established practice, that your rapporteur proposes the rejection of the initiative on which the Parliament is being consulted here.
