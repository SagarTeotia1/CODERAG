Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (16 October 2003) As of 28 July 2003, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have ratified the Montreal Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The Community ratified the Montreal amendment on 17 November 2000. The Montreal Amendment, adopted in 1997 at the ninth meeting of the Parties, requires all Parties to implement an import and export licensing system. Implementing such systems is important in helping to prevent illegal trade in ozone depleting substances. The Commission, on behalf of the Community and its Member States, has implemented an import and export licensing system for controlled substances which operates under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer OJ L 244, 29.9.2000 . .
