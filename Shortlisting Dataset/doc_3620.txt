WRITTEN QUESTION P-4798/09 by Antonyia Parvanova (ALDE) to the Council (5 October 2009) Subject: Fighting the counterfeiting of medicines as an organised crime activity As part of its Pharmaceuticals package, the European Commission proposed a Directive amending Directive 2001/83/EC OJ L 311, 28.11.2001 , p. 67. as regards the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source (2008/0261 (COD)). This proposal, though aimed at reinforcing the security of the legal supply chain of medicine and ensuring the traceability of pharmaceutical products in the European Union, does not address the fight against counterfeit medicines outside this legal chain of supply, and therefore does not fully tackle the issue of the counterfeiting of medicines as an organised crime activity. According to the WHO, less than 1 % of medicines sold through the legal supply chain in developed markets such as the EU are counterfeited. The current proposal will certainly help reduce this figure, but the main efforts should therefore focus on the illegal supply chain of medicines, which should be addressed through greater justice, police and customs cooperation. What existing coordination measures in the field of justice, police and customs cooperation are taken by the Council to specifically tackle counterfeit medicines in the European Union? Is the Council considering the development of further initiatives in the field of justice, police and customs cooperation, in order to complement the current Commission proposal which only addresses the security of the legal supply chain of medicines through administrative and technical measures?
