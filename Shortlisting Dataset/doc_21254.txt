to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Welcomes the Commission communication on a roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 and considers that measures should be implemented in a coordinated, cost-efficient and effective way, allowing for the specific characteristics of Member States; points out that the current financial and economic crisis must be borne in mind when designing policies to ensure and support upfront investments which contribute to increased renewable energy sources in order to reduce energy costs in the long term and improve energy efficiency in the fields of energy provision and transport; emphasises that a sustainable low carbon economy represents a great opportunity to bring the crisis to an end in terms of economic growth and increased employment, particularly in green jobs; 2. Recalls that the long-term economic costs of not taking action to prevent climate change far outweigh the short-term costs of taking strong and decisive action now; 3. Recalls that world primary energy demand will increase by more than 30% up to 2035, thereby increasing global competition for energy resources; 4. Recognises that climate change is a global issue; points out that unilateral action is not sufficient for the purpose of reducing emissions sufficiently rapidly and that the extensive involvement of non EU-countries is necessary; stresses that the EU must continue to act constructively in global climate negotiations and European climate diplomacy needs to be further developed under the umbrella of the EEAS; reiterates the need for an international post-2012 agreement and for firm and more ambitious commitments from all developed countries and for countries with high rates of economic growth to adopt ambitious and sufficient targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; points out that the main challenge for a sustainable low carbon economy is to ensure that climate change policies are integrated into all key fields of activity relating to energy, transport, agriculture, education, innovation, etc.; 5. Calls for the Commission to set interim greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2040, including concrete objectives for each sector, together with an ambitious timetable; calls for greater consistency among Community programmes and policies in order to achieve the roadmap’s objectives and ensure its priorities are fully integrated in the new 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework; acknowledges that delivering the 20% energy efficiency target would allow the EU to reduce its internal CO2 emissions by 25% or more by 2020, and that this reduction would still be on a cost-effective path towards the long-term 2050 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% from 1990 levels; notes that, according to the roadmap, a less ambitious approach would result in significantly higher costs over the entire period; recalls, however, that the cost-effectiveness of investments should always be measured in the light of Member State budgets; 6. Emphasises that China is the world leader in terms of installed wind farm capacity, that Chinese and Indian producers are among the top ten wind turbine producers, and that China and Taiwan currently manufacture most of the world’s photovoltaic panels; calls on the
