Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (4 May 2009) Homeopathic medicinal products can only be placed on the market if a marketing authorisation or a registration under the simplified registration procedure for homeopathic medicinal products is granted. These procedures are national procedures handled by the competent authorities in each Member State. As the Commission is not informed by the Member States on authorisations granted, the Commission does not have concrete figures on the registrations or marketing authorisations issued in the Member States for homeopathic medicinal products. In order to provide accurate figures on the registrations or marketing authorisations granted in each Member State, the Commission has requested the Homeopathic Medicinal Products Working Group, established under the Heads of Medicines Agencies, to collect such information and to provide it to the Commission, which will then be provided directly to the Honourable Member.
