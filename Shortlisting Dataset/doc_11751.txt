WRITTEN QUESTION E-4957/06 by Antolín Sánchez Presedo (PSE) and Joan Calabuig Rull (PSE) to the Commission (16 November 2006) Subject: Blackout in Europe On Saturday 4 November 2006 the electricity company E.ON disconnected a high-voltage power line in Lower Saxony in order to allow the safe passage of the cruise-ship Norwegian Pearl, which was sailing along the river Ems. This made the network unstable and produced a major power cut with a knock-on effect that lasted nearly 50 minutes and affected nine EU countries and 10 million European citizens, half of them in France. The incident highlights the interdependence and vulnerability of the European electricity system and is not unprecedented, since three years ago a power cut left the whole of Italy without electric light and spread to other European countries, including France and Germany. At present there are no rules laying down European service obligations, companies operate in an asymmetrical way in accordance with different regulations on each of the national markets and the interconnections between the networks of the Member States are inadequate. Various officials have called for reflection on the magnitude and gravity of this incident, which brought Europe to the edge of collapse or a generalised blackout. Can the Commission say: 1. what view it takes of the power failure and what steps it envisages taking to ensure that it does not happen again; 2. how security of electricity supply and the conditions of distribution are to be guaranteed in the Union and whether a European energy market can be created without a European policy conducted by a joint authority?
