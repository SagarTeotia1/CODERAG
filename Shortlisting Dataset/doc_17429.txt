Question for written answer E-009780/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (3 November 2011) Subject: Proposed legal framework for cohesion policy post-2013 MEPs discussed the proposed legal framework for cohesion policy post-2013 at a joint meeting of the European Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development. Cohesion policy accounts for 45 % of the EU budget and its aim is to help the poorest regions whilst boosting competitiveness and employment. In relation to the financial crisis, politicians have focused on promoting growth within the regions. EU cohesion policy is effective and has a successful record, but it is necessary to take further action. The Commission’s proposal aims to simplify access to funding, by bringing all five funds that make up the cohesion policy under the umbrella of a single regulation, which should simplify the procedures for individual applicants. National authorities should set clear goals in priority areas. However, if the Commission considers national budgetary policies unsustainable, it will be entitled to cut funding. What is the opinion of the Commission on the finding that the approval of such conditions would in fact impose a double penalty on certain countries that have already suffered enough from the consequences of the financial crisis?
