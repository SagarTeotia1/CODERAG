WRITTEN QUESTION E-4390/07 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (13 September 2007) Subject: School transport in the prefectures of Pella, Serres, Drama and Thessaloniki In his answer of 22 December 2006 to my written question on this subject (E‑4234/06), Commissioner McCreevy states that the Commission is not in a position to use the ‘corrective mechanism’ provided for in Article 8 of the remedies Council Directive 92/13/EEC, because it can only be used prior to the conclusion of a contract. Bearing in mind also the supplementary information furnished on 24.7.2007 as part of complaint 2007/4339, SG(2007) A/2711/2, will the Commission say: Does it intend to implement Article 8 of the above Directive in respect of the procedures for awarding school transport contracts in the school year 2007-08?
