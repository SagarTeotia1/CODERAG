Reply (21 September 2006) The Council is not aware of the facts referred to by the Honourable Member. The Council would like to remind the Honourable Member that according to Article 223 of the EC Treaty, the Judges and Advocates‑General of the Court of Justice shall be chosen from persons whose independence is beyond doubt and shall be appointed by common accord of the governments of the Member States. By virtue of Article 4 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, ‘The Judges may not hold any political or administrative office. They may not engage in any occupation, whether gainful or not, unless exemption is exceptionally granted by the Council. When taking up their duties, they shall give a solemn undertaking that, both during and after their term of office, they will respect the obligations arising therefrom, in particular the duty to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments or benefits. Any doubt on this point shall be settled by decision of the Court.’ Article 6 of the Statute states that ‘A Judge may be deprived of his office or of his right to a pension or other benefits in its stead only if, in the unanimous opinion of the Judges and Advocates General of the Court, he no longer fulfils the requisite conditions or meets the obligations arising from his office.’
