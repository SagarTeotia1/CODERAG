Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (14 December 2011) The European Commission is aware of BP's new pipeline project to transport Azeri gas from the Shah Deniz II field to Europe. Several other pipeline projects, including ITGI, Nabucco and TAP, are competing for these gas volumes in Azerbaijan. In that context, the Commission believes that project promoters should seek synergies from the articulation of their projects in order to optimize their respective benefits, in full respect of the EU's competition rules, and to develop a solution that satisfactorily fits the EU's strategic objectives for the Southern Gas Corridor. It is a fact that the share of imported gas in total consumption volumes will increase over the next twenty years in the European Union as a result of both the decreasing domestic production and the expected evolution of the demand. Therefore these projects will help to diversify the sources of gas supply and to increase the security of supply in the Union. For any potential activity to be undertaken in the Arctic, the Commission would expect any EU‑headquartered company to apply the best technologies and standards of operation available, which is also the aim of the recently outlined draft EU regulation ‘On safety of offshore oil and gas prospection, exploration and production activities’ http://ec.europa.eu/energy/oil/offshore/doc/com_2011_0688.pdf .
