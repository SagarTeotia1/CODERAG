Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (6 August 2007) The Commission has not investigated the Romanian banking markets. The retail banking sector inquiry which was concluded in January 2007 The Final Report was published on 31 January 2007 and can be found under http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/antitrust/others/sector_inquiries/financial_services/retail.html covered the then twenty five Member States, but not Romania and Bulgaria since the inquiry was launched 18 months before the accession of these countries Commission decision of 13 June 2005 which can be also found under http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/antitrust/others/sector_inquiries/financial_services/retail.html . The Commission is currently focusing on following up the inquiry. In the context of the European Competition Network (ECN) More documents are on http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/ecn/index_en.html , the Commission closely cooperates with the national competition authorities regarding the examination of potentially anticompetitive behaviour. In the situation raised by the Honourable Member, in view of the fact that the alleged behaviour is said to affect the Romanian banking sector, the national competition authority may be well placed to deal with the matter. The Commission, therefore, has informed the Romanian Competition Council about the issues raised by the Honourable Member. The Commission understands that the Romanian Competition Council intends to launch its own national sector inquiry into retail banking and payment systems in September 2007. In order to be able to follow up allegations of anticompetitive behaviour effectively, concrete indications as to, for instance, identical or similar fees, would be helpful. The Commission, therefore, invites the Honourable Member as well as companies potentially concerned to submit such information to the Commission and/or the Romanian Competition Council For contact details see: http://www.competition.ro/en/index1.asp?lang=en .
