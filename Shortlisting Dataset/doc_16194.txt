clearing mechanism under which, in case of the occurrence of an irregulartiy or negligence, 50 % of any undue payments which the Member States have not recovered from the beneficiaries within 4 years (in the case of legal proceedings, 8 years) is charged to their national budgets (50/50 rule). Moreover, since 2008, Member States are required to off-set any outstanding debts against future payments to the debtor (compulsory compensation) and any undue payments which are the result of administrative errors committed by the national authorities have to be deducted from the annual accounts of the paying agencies concerned and, thus, are excluded from EU financing. Together, these legislative changes provide a strong incentive for Member States to recover undue payments from the beneficiaries as quickly as possible. As a result, by the end of financial year 2009, 39 % of the new debts from 2007 and thereafter had already been recovered, which is a significant improvement compared to the past. The table below gives a detailed breakdown of this recovery rate. recovery rate until end of 2007 until end of 2008 until end of 2009 year of discovery of the irregularity 2007 33 % 46 % 49 % 2008 - 24 % 40 % 2009 - - 24 % 2007-09 - - 39 % Moreover, due to the fact that the 50/50 rule has already been applied to many debt cases since its introduction in 2006, the amount outstanding to the EU budget is considerably lower than the amount outstanding towards the Member States from the final beneficiaries, as presented in the document on the Statistical Evaluation of Irregularities referred to by the Honourable Member. This applies also to Italy, which is responsible for 48 % of the total outstanding amount in the EU. Over the last four years, the Commission has charged EUR 270.7 million to Italy under the 50/50 rule in respect of the amounts not recovered within 4 or 8 years See Commission Decisions 2007/327/EC, 2008/394/EC, 2008/396/EC, 2009/367/EC, 2010/258/EU. . Finally, the Commission systematically carries out on-the-spot controls to review the paying agencies' debt management systems and their procedures for recovering debts and, if it is found that the national authorities fail to recover the outstanding amounts with the necessary diligence, charges the entire amounts to the Member State concerned.
