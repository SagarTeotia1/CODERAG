Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (17 November 2010) The Commission is aware of the significance of impacts of weather conditions on the management of power grids. There are different options available, also to be used in combination, to optimise the methods of operating the electricity networks to which PV plants are connected and to suppress the fluctuations caused by unstable solar radiation. The call for proposals for 2011 of the 7th Framework Programme for Research, currently open for submission, has an increased budget available for renewable electricity production , including grid and storage monitoring.
