an attempt to establish the rights of the undertaking concerned, and can therefore only serve to harass the competitor; and, second, the legal action must be conceived in the framework of a plan whose goal is to eliminate competition. Since the two criteria constitute an exception to the principle of access to the Courts, they must be construed and applied strictly The CFI did not explicitly confirm that the two criteria were well founded because the claimant did not challenge them, but gave some indications as to how they should be interpreted. , which is also one of key issues that are currently looked upon in the context of the sector enquiry into the pharmaceutical industry. For the purposes of applying Article 82 of the EC Treaty, it does not make any difference whether the undertaking concerned is based in the EU or outside the EU if the abuse restricts competition within the common market or in a substantial part of it and as long as it may affect trade between Member States. This allows the Commission to take action against abuses committed by undertakings based outside the EU, as it is clear for example from the Commission's 2004 Decision against Microsoft, which was upheld by the Court in September 2007. Conversely, the Commission does not have jurisdiction over abuses of dominant companies outside the EU in so far as these abuses do not affect competition within the common market or a substantial part of it and do not affect trade between Member States. However, the Commission cooperates extensively with national competition authorities of third countries with a view to them creating and applying a legal framework preventing abuses of dominant position. This is notably aimed at allowing EU companies to be able to compete on the merits with local incumbents, but also entails that EU companies that have a dominant position on non‑EU markets will be subject to the rules on abuse of dominant position applicable in the third countries concerned.
