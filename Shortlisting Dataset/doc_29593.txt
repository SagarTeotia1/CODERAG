Question for written answer E-8227/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Alexander Alvaro (ALDE) (13 October 2010) Subject: US access to European police computers Austria grants the USA access to certain data on Austrian police computers, according to the Austrian newspaper Die Presse (29.9.2010), quoting government circles in Vienna. The article says that the USA had previously threatened to remove Austria from the ‘Visa Waiver Programme’ (VWP) and therefore reintroduce the visa requirement for Austrians. The USA has apparently written to say that an agreement in the negotiations must be reached by 31 December 2010. Can the Commission confirm these reports? What is the exact content of the abovementioned letter? Will the Commission take steps in response to the USA's requests? Which Member States have received similar requests? What is the current status of the negotiations with the USA on this matter? Does the USA expect anything else to be linked to preservation of the ‘Visa Waiver Programme’?
