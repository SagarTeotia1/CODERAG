Answer given by Mrs Grybauskaitė on behalf of the Commission (3 March 2006) The Member of the Commission responsible for financial programming and budget is aware that the accounting treatment adopted to account for the pension scheme has been the same each year since this was first introduced in the EC balance sheet. A provision is included on the liabilities side of the balance sheet and a receivable from Member States on the assets side of the balance sheet for the same amount. Therefore, as confirmed in the Commission's reply to Written Question E‑3889/05 by the Honourable Member, the Commission has been consistent in this accounting treatment for the past four years. The reply to Written Question E‑3889/05 also stated that the issue will be re-addressed when an IPSAS (international public sector accounting standards) on the subject is available. With regard to provisions, it is a basic and accepted accounting method that an increase or reversal of a provision is treated as expenses/income under accrual accounting. There is no attempt to obscure the movements on provisions in the 2004 accounts. The amounts of the provisions at year-end 2004 and 2003 were shown in the notes to the balance sheet. The movement between the two years is included in the result of adjustment and the result of the ECSC (European Coal & Steel Community) in liquidation. From the 2005 accounts onwards the situation should be further improved with the introduction of full accrual accounting and the related accounting rules — this means that more information on the movements and utilisation of provisions during the financial year will be disclosed in the notes to accounts.
