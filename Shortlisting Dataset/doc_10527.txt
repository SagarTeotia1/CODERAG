WRITTEN QUESTION E-6156/08 by Pedro Guerreiro (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (14 November 2008) Subject: Support for certification of ‘butter’ mackerel ( trachurus trachurus carapau ‘ manteiga ’) At a meeting with the Sesibal Producers’ Organisation (Cooperativa de pesca de Setúbal, Sesimbra e Sines, CRL), I was told that they intended to start certifying ‘butter’ mackerel ( trachurus trachurus carapau ‘ manteiga ’), in order to regulate a quality production process. It is acknowledged that ‘the existence and value of this species is due to the atypical qualitative properties of the spawning grounds which exist in the area, thanks to the biodiversity of its flora and an ecosystem extremely rich in seaweed’. This species is caught by Sesibal (and other) vessels fishing in the waters of the Costa Da Galé — from a Comporta to the Lagoa de Melides — subject to restrictions intended to guarantee the continuity of this extremely nutritious species. What possibilities exist for using Community funding to subsidise the costs of the certification process for this species being encouraged by Sesibal?
