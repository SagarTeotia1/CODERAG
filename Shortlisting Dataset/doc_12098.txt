WRITTEN QUESTION E-5449/09 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Commission (4 November 2009) Subject: Freedom of the press in Turkey During the previous parliamentary term I already criticised the fine imposed on Dogan Yayin, the largest media group in Turkey, because I considered it completely incompatible with freedom of the press. In its recent progress report on Turkey the Commission likewise severely criticised this fine, which is said to be in the region of EUR 2.2 billion. The Commission stated (rightly) that this fine amounted to political interference with the press because various Dogan Yayin publications had drawn attention to corruption within the ruling AKP. In response to this Commission report, Turkey's chief negotiator, Egemen Bagis, said that the fine was a matter purely for the Turkish Ministry of Finance and not for any foreign body. What is the Commission's response to this answer from Turkey's chief negotiator? Will the Commission impose a binding time limit on Turkey? What influence will all this have on the current negotiations?
