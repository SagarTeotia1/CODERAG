Question for written answer E-5502/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Carlo Fidanza (PPE) and Licia Ronzulli (PPE) (14 July 2010) Subject: GM salmon The US Food and Drug Administration is seriously considering the possibility of approving the marketing of a laboratory-modified salmon variant which matures at twice the speed of ordinary salmon. This is an Atlantic salmon created by the company Aqua Bounty Technologies using a Chinook salmon gene and a codfish gene, which produces the growth hormone even in winter and attains a weight suitable for sale in 18 months rather then three years. This would be the first case of a genetically modified fauna species appearing on the market in food products. Approval of this ‘super salmon’ would open the way to more cases of generic engineering of fauna by private companies and research institutes. In the light of earlier experiences in the EU and the decisions 2010/135/EU OJ L 53, 4.3.2010, p.11 . and 2010/136/EU OJ L 53, 4.3.2010, p.15 . of 2 March 2010 authorising the placing on the market of feed produced from the BASF genetically modified potato, can the Commission state its position on GM fauna? What would be the Commission's response to a possible request for approval here in Europe in respect of the placing of GM fauna species on the consumer market in food products?
