Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2010) Since December 2009 the Commission mandated a consultant to carry out an evaluation on the EU policy on animal welfare. The technical details of this evaluation are available at a dedicated Internet website accessible to the public (www.eupaw.eu). The evaluation contains eleven questions, one of which relates to the economic sustainability of the EU policy on animal welfare for the farming sectors and for the industries using animals for experiment: ‘To what extent do animal welfare policies contribute to the economic sustainability of the sectors concerned (farming animals and experimental animals)?’ The results of this evaluation are expected for the end of December 2010. In addition, in the context of the seventh framework programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities, the Commission has supported a research project called ECONWELFARE (www.econwelfare.eu). The main objective of the project is to study the socioeconomic impacts of the EU policy on animal welfare on the livestock production chain, the animal and the society. The final results of the project are expected in July 2011. The Commission will publicise those overall results to the European institutions and the general public at large. Furthermore, the Commission undertakes impact assessments of all its major policy proposals, which include an assessment of the economic, social and environmental impacts, which also includes consideration of animal welfare when relevant. These impact assessments are carried out according to the procedures and standards established in the impact assessment guidelines SEC(2009)92. .
