WRITTEN QUESTION E-4944/08 by Anni Podimata (PSE) to the Commission (17 September 2008) Subject: Measures against atmospheric pollution from motor vehicle emissions Directive 2003/76/EC OJ L 206, 15.8.2003, p. 29. amending Directive 70/220/EEC proposes measures to be taken against atmospheric pollution from motor vehicle emissions. In Greece atmospheric pollution thresholds are often exceeded in major urban centres, owing to the large number of cars. According to official statistics of the Greek Federation of Car Importers, 1240000 cars over 15 years old either without catalytic converters or with first generation catalysers are in circulation, and there are a further 530000 cars with catalytic converters which are between 10 and 15 old, very few of which have replaced their spent catalytic converters. Withdrawing old motor vehicles, which would significantly improve the state of the car stock and thereby their environmental performance, is a measure which has been postponed to the future, since according to statements by the competent ministries, the cycle of withdrawal will begin at the earliest in 2010 and take a period of at least five years to complete. In view of the above, will the Commission state: 1. Is it aware of the number of cars with spent catalytic converters in Greece? 2. Does it intend to take additional measures to tackle the phenomenon of spent catalytic converters which leads to environmental degradation of air in the cities and frequent overshoots of the ozone limits?
