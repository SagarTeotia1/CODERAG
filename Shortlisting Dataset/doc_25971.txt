rate in function of the size of the balance sheets, governments can increase the levy on big banks, thereby addressing the problem of banks becoming ‘too big to fail’; 15. Calls on the Member States to increase taxes on bank’s and manager’s bonuses, on income from capital (dividends, interest rates), on capital gains and on big fortunes and inheritances, using the receipts from these to increase public sector led investment; points out that in this way demand dynamics can be strengthened and embedded into a strategy for environmentally and socially sustainable development, with a perspective of diminishing deficits in the medium term; points out that Member States should provide for cuts in military spending and in subsidies harmful to the environment to assist fiscal consolidation; 16. Points out that additional monies for the new European Recovery Plan should be mobilised by cuts in the EU budget as regards for example military spending and defence, nuclear power and nuclear fusion, structural fund projects and TEN projects harmful to the environment; also considers it necessary to establish budgetary support measures to countries in a more serious crisis situation, particularly by advancing Community funds without the need for national counterparts; calls on the Commission and the Council to prolong the recently established easing of rules on state aid at least as long as stagnation and high unemployment prevail; 17. Takes the view that the financial sector must operate first and foremost in the public interest, accept lower returns and be geared to risk-aversion and long-term targets instead of short-term profits; considers that a socialisation of the banking sector and the constitution of a publicly owned financial pole (nationalised banks, local and regional savings bank, cooperative banks) are urgently needed to steer credit towards socially and environmentally useful investment which creates good quality employment with workers' rights; considers that decision making on credit policies of the financial sector must come under democratic public control and democratic participation of employees and consumers; 18. Insists on strong measures to curb financial market speculation; highlights that immediate urgency measures are needed to prohibit naked short-selling and trading in credit default swaps and to establish a public European rating agency; points out that hedge funds and private equity funds should be prohibited to operate in the EU or at least severely restricted, offshore centres closed down, and also investments of pension funds strictly limited to European government bonds, with no investment allowed in hedge or private equity funds, foreign exchange, derivatives and equity; calls on the Commission and the Council to speed up tighter regulation of financial sector oversight; 19. Criticises the proposals of the Task Force headed by the President of the European Council and of the ECOFIN Council on stricter fiscal surveillance and on 'structural reform' measures to address competitiveness and balance of payments developments within the eurozone; 20. Takes note of the ECOFIN Council's decision to establish a European Financial Stabilisation mechanism with a total volume of up to 500 billion Euro, based on Article 122.2 of the Treaty and an intergovernmental agreement of the euro area
