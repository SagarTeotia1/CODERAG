WRITTEN QUESTION E-6683/09 by João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (13 January 2010) Subject: Geneva agreement on trade in bananas On 15 December 2009, the EU reached an agreement with Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Venezuela on trade in bananas. The EU undertook to proceed to a substantial reduction in its import tariff on bananas from those countries, from EUR 176/tonne to EUR 114/tonne by 2017. The first and most significant cut (of EUR 28/tonne) will take effect immediately after the signing of the agreement, resulting in a tariff of EUR 148/tonne. This agreement will worsen the difficulties faced by the EU's own banana producers, especially in Portugal — above all in the Madeira autonomous region, but also in the Azores autonomous region and on the mainland. The main beneficiaries of the recently signed agreement will be the US multinationals in the sector which operate in the Latin American countries concerned. Can the Commission: 1. state what studies have been carried out to assess the impact of the recently signed agreement on banana producers in the EU, especially Portugal, and what conclusions were reached by those studies; 2. state what support measures for local production, in the short and the medium to long term, have been or will be introduced in order to safeguard those producers' right to produce, guaranteeing fair producer prices and ensuring that this activity is viable; 3. state what forms of Community aid are available to support Portuguese banana producers; 4. provide information on the content of the parallel agreement reached between the EU and the US?
