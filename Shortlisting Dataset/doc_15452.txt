importance of the third strand of Parliament's strategy, preparing for the review of the MFF, which should deliver EU spending that is better focused on policy priorities; believes that by focusing commitments on priority programmes and by ensuring that funds are well spent, EU spending will better serve the interests of citizens; 6. Expects that all new elements and reforms set down in the new IIA of 17 May 2006 will be fully implemented in the course of the 2007 budget in order to have a rapid effect on the qualitative implementation of the budget and the inter-institutional relationship; Horizontal issues Focusing on priorities 7. In line with Parliament's priorities, considers that EU spending should be focused on priority areas and at a higher level than proposed in the draft budget of the Council in order to ensure effective delivery of priority programmes to citizens; therefore proposes to increase payments in the 2007 budget to a level of 1,04% of EU GNI by increasing appropriations on budget lines linked to the Parliament's political priorities; notes that most of the specialised parliamentary committees have proposed to restore the amounts of the Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB), in line with the ongoing legislative procedures, or those beginning in 2007; Tackling the challenges of globalisation 8. Believes that the European Union must actively address and engage more effectively with the economic, political, social, environmental and development challenges presented inter alia by the ongoing process of globalisation; therefore presents amendments to the 2007 budget that aim at boosting the capacity of the EU economy to engage with these challenges in a more strategic manner, and raising the amounts of development assistance available to regions such as Asia and Latin America and the Mediterranean; Delivering value for money 9. Emphasises the need for improved value for money in the EU budget; proposes amendments to place 30 % of appropriations in reserve on a number of budget lines until the Commission can reassure the Parliament that this money will be spent in a manner that delivers value for money to the European taxpayer; 10. Recalls that these budget lines were selected on the basis of a thorough examination of the special reports of the Court of Auditors, the Synthesis Reports on the Commission's management of funds, the Budget Forecast Alert prepared by the Commission, and cost-benefit analyses carried out at the request of the Committee on Budgets and taking into account the activity statements prepared by the Commission services; 11. Specifically welcomes the call for a hearing in mid-November for the Commission to respond to the concerns raised in these amendments; urges members of Parliament's specialised committees to participate in this hearing; 12. Reduces by 10% the appropriations for administrative management directly linked to programmes on a horizontal basis; sees no contradiction for budget lines on which the Parliament both places amounts in reserve due to some concerns about the quality of implementation and increases appropriations according to political priorities; reaffirms, in this connection, that it wishes to see qualitative value for money in all areas of EU spending;
