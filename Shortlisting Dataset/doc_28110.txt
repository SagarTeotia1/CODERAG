ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0080/07 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Jan Marinus Wiersma , on behalf of the PSE Group to the Council Subject: A European Roma strategy In April 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation of Roma ( P6_TA(2005)0151 ), calling on the European Commission to prepare a communication on how the EU could best coordinate and promote efforts to improve the situation of the Roma and to adopt an action plan with clear recommendations to the Member States. The resolution also suggested considering recognising the Roma as a transnational European minority. Considering the lack of overall improvement of the situation of European Roma, will the Council attach priority to addressing Roma issues in 2008? Will the Council launch a debate on the position of Roma in EU Member States in the framework of the Year of Intercultural Dialogue? The position of Roma is distinct from that of other minorities in Europe, since Roma are historically present in many European countries, while any territorial dimension is absent. Recognition of this fact would underpin the shared responsibility of the EU and its Member States to promote Roma inclusion. Is the Council considering adopting a declaration to acknowledge the distinct position of European Roma and to assert its commitment to a collective effort to promote Roma inclusion? Is the Council considering following the Romanian proposal to develop a Community Action Plan on Roma, asking the European Commission to come forward with specific proposals to promote Roma inclusion? Will the Council place the progress and preliminary results of the ‘Decade of Roma Inclusion’ on the agenda of the Social Affairs Council in 2008, with a view to evaluating and supporting the efforts of all countries (both EU Member States and non-member states) to promote Roma inclusion?
