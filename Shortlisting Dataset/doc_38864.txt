Question for Question Time H-0441/2010 to the Commission Part-session: September II 2010 Rule 116 Justas Vincas Paleckis (S&D) Subject: Declared nuclear power project developments The Baltic Sea region has recently become one of the most active zones for declared nuclear power projects under development. The safety status of those projects is very significant for the whole EU. It would be most regrettable if neighbouring countries in the close vicinity of the EU's Eastern external border (12 km in the case of Kaliningrad and 20 km in the case of Belarus, the latter project moreover being only 55 km from Vilnius, the capital of an EU Member State) chose to disregard their international obligations while implementing their nuclear energy projects. For the time being nuclear power plant project developers in Belarus and in the Kaliningrad region are failing to supply comprehensive information on the methods to be used to manage the BNPP nuclear waste, decommissioning strategies, any other potential risks associated with major accidents or population evacuation strategies should an accident occur - to name a few topics. What are the Commission’s views on how to secure appropriate safety standards in the vicinity of the EU's external border (bearing in mind the above-mentioned nuclear projects)? What could be done at EU level in the context of the common European energy policy?
