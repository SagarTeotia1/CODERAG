WRITTEN QUESTION E-0527/10 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Commission (16 February 2010) Subject: Violation of human rights in Zimbabwe In 2008, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) declared the land seizure policy of Mugabe and his associates illegal. The SADC Tribunal ruled that white farmers could keep their land because Mugabe's policy was racist. White farmers had applied to the Tribunal after exhausting all domestic remedies in Zimbabwe. Recently, however, a court in the capital, Harare, rejected the Tribunal's ruling, allowing the Zimbabwe Government simply to continue with its land seizures. Is the Commission aware of the ruling by the SADC Tribunal and if so, what view does it take of it? Must Zimbabwe implement the ruling? If not, why not? If so, what steps will the Commission take vis-à-vis the government to secure the execution of the ruling? What sanctions or other measures is the Commission considering in this connection?
