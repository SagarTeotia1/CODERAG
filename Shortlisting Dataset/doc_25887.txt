Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2010) As noted in press release IP/04/919 the Commission sent a Reasoned Opinion to Ireland in relation to the refusal of the Irish authorities to allow direct reimbursement of costs incurred by individuals who purchased medical appliances in other Member States. On 20 July 2005 the Irish authorities confirmed that new provisions and procedures had been put in place and were being applied. The new provisions were assessed at the time and it appeared that the Irish rules were in line with EC law. As a result the Commission closed this case on 13 December 2005.
