Question for written answer E-010582/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (17 November 2011) Subject: Debts owed to European firms in Libya A study by the Italian-Libyan Chamber of Commerce indicates that the total amount of debts claimed in 2011 by Italian undertakings operating in Libya was around EUR 225 million. The data relate to the situation at 30 September 2011; 102 companies were interviewed, of which 79 had asked for the repayment of debts and 23 had not; the damage caused was estimated at EUR 196 597.000. In view of the serious adverse impact on all such European undertakings of the Libyan conflict, at a time when the whole euro area is in crisis, there is a risk that such undertakings will be replaced by others from outside the European Union, which will further damage Europe’s economy. Would the Council indicate what decision it intends to take as regards the sums owed to the many European undertakings which have sustained damage in Libya?
