WRITTEN QUESTION E-1758/05 by Antoine Duquesne (ALDE) to the Commission (19 May 2005) Subject: European policy on sectarianism France's Interministerial Committee on Observation and Control of Sectarianism has recently published a report for the French Prime Minister on ‘The risk of sectarianism during 2004 in France’. This report contains some interesting information about legislative reforms that were undertaken during 2004 in France and covers: local-level observation; general activities to provide aid to victims; current case-law; a study on the risk of sectarianism; a study of groups vulnerable to sectarianism; points of comparison between policies adopted by different countries on the matter (Austria, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland). Is the Commission intending to build a common European front on the problem of sects? Is a comparative study on new religious movements throughout Europe being drawn up or envisaged? Is a comparative study of current legislation in each Member State being drawn up or envisaged? Are specific actions against sectarianism being taken or envisaged?
