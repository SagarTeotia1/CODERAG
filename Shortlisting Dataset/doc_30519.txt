Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2012) The Commission is neither in a position to assess the quality nor to comment on the results of the census carried out on 4 December 2011, which the Honourable Members refers to. As regards other issues mentioned in the question, they are subject to the ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive Cyprus settlement under the auspices of the United Nations. The Commission has repeatedly called on the leaders of both communities in Cyprus to grasp the opportunity of the ongoing talks to reach a comprehensive settlement.
