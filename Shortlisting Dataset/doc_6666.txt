Question for written answer E-000959/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antonyia Parvanova (ALDE) (9 February 2011) Subject: Foods for Medical Purposes Foods for Special Medical Purposes (FSMPs) are targeted at patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition because they are unable to absorb the essential nutrients they need due to illness, surgery or the side effects of treatment. They are a critical and cost-effective resource that healthcare professionals use on a daily basis to help ensure that patients get the nutrients they need. Medical foods are regulated by the framework Directive 2009/39/EC on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (PARNUTS) and vertical Directive 1999/21/EC on dietary foods for special medical purposes (FSMPs). In addition, they must comply with general EU food legislation regarding food safety, hygiene, and labelling. However, some of the provisions currently foreseen, such as the minimum font size and nutrition declaration requirements under the proposal on Food Information to Consumers, do not appear to be appropriate for use of these products by healthcare professionals and patients. 1. Given the above, does the Commission intend to rectify the fact that the proposal on Food Information to Consumers does not distinguish FSMPs as foods targeted at patients and not consumers? Will the Commission grant any exemptions for FSMPs so that they can be used appropriately by healthcare professionals and patients? If so, how can this be done most effectively? 2. In addition, in the context of the upcoming review of the PARNUTS Directive in 2011, will the Commission ensure that provisions regarding information about, and the labelling of, foods for medical purposes will take into account the specificity of such products and adequately respond to the needs of healthcare professionals and patients?
