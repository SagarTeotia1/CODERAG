Question for written answer E-000257/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Angelika Niebler (PPE) (24 January 2011) Subject: Dominant position of watch and clock manufacturers German watch and clockmakers still have considerable problems obtaining original spare parts. Some companies and brand suppliers in the EU (Germany) and Switzerland oblige watch and clockmakers to send faulty timepieces directly to the manufacturers, who carry out repairs themselves. In Germany, some 80 000 employees work in this sector, which is one of the most professional crafts in the world thanks to master certificates and apprentice training. Since spare parts are not delivered, they cannot do their job. This clearly constitutes discrimination and a disadvantage for watch and clockmakers, whose livelihood is endangered. Moreover, competition is severely restricted and some manufacturers have a dominant position. 1. In view of the recent ECJ judgment (Case T-427/08), does the Commission still consider that competition is not restricted in this sector? 2. Is it considering an amendment to the vertical block exemption regulation so that all craftsmen are treated in the same way as car mechanics, in that they can all obtain original spare parts? 3. If it is not considering such an amendment, how does it propose to prevent the exclusion of watch and clockmakers from competition in future? Does it see a general need for action?
