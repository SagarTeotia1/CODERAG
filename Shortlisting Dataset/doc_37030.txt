Question for written answer E-005365/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (6 June 2011) Subject: Armed raids on the Sudanese town of Yambio According to UN reports and articles in the Greek press, the Sudanese town of Yambio has been looted and laid to waste after repeated incursions by armed forces. It has been under the control of North Sudan's government army since Saturday. Sudanese living in Yambio have been protesting against the military occupation of the town. Since soldiers and armoured vehicles from the ‘Sudanese armed forces’ (North Sudan regular army) took control, in violation of the agreement concluded, thousands of unarmed civilians have fled further into South Sudan. Meanwhile, some residents have taken to the streets of Yambio to demonstrate against the military occupation. What is the official EU position on this situation?
