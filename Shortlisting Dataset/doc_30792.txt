Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (12 March 2012) The contracting parties have ensured that the commitments laid down in the international agreement are compatible with the EU Treaties. The Commission would have favoured an agreement between the 27 Member States and within the Community method. However it welcomes the commitment of the Heads of State or Government of the euro area Member States and of other Member States of the European Union to take the necessary steps to incorporate the provisions of the Treaty on stability, coordination and governance in the economic and monetary union into the legal framework of the European Union within five years at most following the entry into force of this Treaty.
