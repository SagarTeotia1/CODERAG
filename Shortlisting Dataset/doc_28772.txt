Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (20 May 2010) The Commission is not aware of the matter raised by the Honourable Member. According to the information provided by the Honourable Member, the Regional Government of Valencia has approved a natural resources and land use management plan (NRMP) for an area that includes the sites ES0000059 ‘Llacunes de la Mata i Torrevieja’ and ES0000120 ‘Salinas de Santa Pola’, designated for the Natura 2000 network under the provisions of the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC Directive 2009/147/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds. OJ L 20, 26.1.2010. and of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . According to the information provided, the plan would allow for urban developments in a significant part of the site's perimeter. The Habitats Directive does not prohibit economic development within Natura 2000 sites. However, the directive requires, in its Article 6(3), that any plan or project likely to have a negative effect upon such a site is subject to an appropriate assessment having regard to the site's conservation objectives. In the light of the conclusions of the assessment, the competent authorities shall agree to this plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site. The provisions contained in Article 6 (4) of the directive set out the exceptional circumstances under which plans and projects with negative effects may still proceed. It is the responsibility of the Spanish competent authorities to ensure that these requirements are fully met before authorising the housing developments in question. On the basis of the elements provided by the Honourable Member, the Commission will contact the Spanish authorities in order to obtain information about compliance with the aforementioned provisions.
