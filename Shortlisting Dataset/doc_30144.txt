Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (13 March 2012) The EU is deeply concerned about the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including the issue of prison camps. The United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK has also drawn attention to this issue in his reports. The EU has, since 2004, sponsored an annual Resolution at the UN General Assembly condemning violations of human rights in the DPRK. In December 2011, the General Assembly adopted the latest EU‑sponsored resolution with an unprecedented level of support (123 votes in favour). In addition, the EU regularly raises human rights concerns as part of its political dialogue with the DPRK. However, the DPRK continues to reject the EU proposal to hold a specific human rights dialogue. In her statement of 20 December 2011, the HR/VP expressed the hope that the new leadership will work to improve the human rights situation in the DPRK and underlined the EU readiness to assist the DPRK in the pursuit of that objective. The EU currently applies a wide range of restrictive measures on the DPRK (including on military exports and on sales of luxury goods), in application of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874.
