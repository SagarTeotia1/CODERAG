Question for written answer E-7489/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Alfredo Antoniozzi (PPE) (16 September 2010) Subject: New directive on the energy efficiency of public buildings — financial support instruments With reference to Written Question E‑4138/10 and to the answer received, it would appear that under the existing rules Member States and management authorities can decide to use only up to 4 % of their ERDF national allocation for measures relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy in housing. Does the Commission not agree that this 4 % limit is insufficient for helping local authorities (regions and municipalities) in their action to support the housing sector? Does the Commission, moreover, not consider that this threshold prevents the objectives set out in the Covenant of Mayors from being successfully achieved? Does the Commission not think it should propose an amendment to the General Regulation on the ERDF structural fund in order to increase that threshold? Should the Commission not also propose an amendment to the Cohesion Fund regulation so that financing may be granted to the housing sector and is not restricted (as with the ERDF) only to measures concerning the improvement of energy systems in public buildings? Cohesion policy objectives cannot ignore housing and social housing policy, which is of such great importance for social cohesion. The penultimate paragraph of the Commission's answer refers to the amendment of 31 May 2010 to the EU's economic recovery programme, which seeks to establish a new EUR 114 million financial instrument to support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects by local authorities. In this regard, can the Commission provide more detailed information on how this instrument will be managed, given that this is a strong political signal in favour of local authorities, which are the ones that actually implement the various plans and projects? In particular, can the Commission say whether these funds will be made available through the administration of the Structural Funds or whether they will be paid directly by Brussels (centralised management) in support of projects submitted by local authorities?
