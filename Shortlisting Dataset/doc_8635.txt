balance sheet had already shrunk by around 10% from its peak, although it has been increasing rapidly since then; notes that, while there has been also a substantial expansion in the balance sheets of other central banks, the ECB's leverage ratio is higher than that of other comparable central banks, with the exception of those which have implemented quantitative easing programmes, such as the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England; 26. Points out and welcomes the fact that the ECB's balance-sheet expansion has not led to inflation; highlights its increasing role as a central counterparty between euro area banks, which reflects a temporary shift in intermediation from the interbank market to the Eurosystem and an increase in euro area assets held by the Eurosystem which will mature over time; points out, further, that providing liquidity to solvent banks does not necessarily entail an increase in monetary supply and notes that the non‑standard measures are of a temporary nature; is convinced that all these developments, together with external factors, have ensured that inflation has consistently remained around 2%; 27. Draws attention once again to the worrying overreliance of many euro area banks on the liquidity provided by the ECB, in the absence of a fully functional interbank market; notes that while in 2010 the Eurosystem accepted EUR 488 billion of asset-backed securities (ABS) as collateral the eligibility criteria for ABS in Eurosystem credit operations have been tightened significantly, which should lead to a reduction in this amount over time; 28. Stresses that the Eurosystem has refused to disclose the method used to determine the 'theoretical price' of impaired assets eligible for its liquidity operations in the framework of the Enhanced Credit Support programme; emphasises that it is therefore impossible to verify whether the ECB has played a quasi-fiscal role; calls, therefore, on the ECB to disclose the valuation methods it has used throughout the crisis, 29. Emphasises that given the lack of a proper euro area crisis framework the ECB was pushed to take risks not covered by its mandate; 30. Asks the ECB to be more open about the quality and quantity of the securities it holds, including ABS accepted as collateral and other marketable and non-marketable securities held for monetary purposes and securities not held for monetary purposes; 31. Acknowledges the need for non-standard monetary policy measures and notes their temporary nature, but calls for a those programmes to be phased out as soon as the financial markets have stabilised and the sovereign debt crisis has been resolved and provided that a Community framework is established to deal properly with financial instability; calls for measures to establish more integrated economic governance; 32. Calls on the ECB to introduce as part of the Security Markets Programme a discount rate mechanism that can be adjusted if a given security is further downgraded by most credit rating agencies, with a view to ensuring that the ECB does not end up with too many risky assets; believes, further, that the ECB should consider the possibility of extending the policy of requiring at least two
