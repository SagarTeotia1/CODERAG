learning is not up to the new requirements of the knowledge-based economy and the urgent need to increase labour market participation in view of our ageing society, L. whereas investment needs in acceding countries, especially in the area of transport networks and environment, remain high considering the low stock of public infrastructure which is often ill-suited to the needs and standards of market economies, M. whereas at the Lisbon European Council, the Union has set itself the goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion; whereas four years will soon have elapsed without any remarkable progress having been made before the 2004 Spring Council, Improving economic governance 1.
