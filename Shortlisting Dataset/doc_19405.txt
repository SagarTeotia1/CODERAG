jobs for young people and women, has mainly been insecure and poorly paid and failed to respect fundamental rights, not least where motherhood is concerned, a fact which has also contributed to the low birth rate. Among the most serious forms of discrimination are those inflicted in numerous instances on specific categories of women, including older women, women with dependants, women who are migrants or belong to minorities, and women with disabilities. Violence and poverty are continuing at a high level; unemployment and discrimination have served to prolong or expand the trafficking in which women and children are brought to Member States to work as prostitutes: these problems need to be tackled as a matter of urgency. Measures at institutional level Although the Member States’ equality policies have reached different stages of development, what is essential in every case is to guarantee equal access to resources, rights, and power, implying a need to bring about structural and cultural change, eliminate stereotypes, and promote equality with a view to achieving it in a context of progress as opposed to retrogression. Existing challenges and the experience acquired suggest that women’s rights need to be coordinated more closely, publicised more widely, and promoted more effectively, and that women’s organisations need to play a role in combating discrimination and inequalities. That is why the EU’s new gender equality strategy needs to be an agenda for action and a political commitment based on the Beijing Platform for Action; after consulting Parliament, the Council should adopt the strategy in order to lend greater political weight and provide fresh impetus for gender equality policy, bearing in mind that the human rights of women and girls form an inalienable and indivisible integral part of universal human rights. In addition, the Council, the Commission, and Parliament should hold an annual tripartite meeting to review the progress of the strategy. Given that women and the organisations representing them need to be involved in the whole process, a conference on gender equality, attended by women’s organisations and trade unions from the Member States and Members of Parliament, the Commission, the Council, and the national parliaments should be held annually, focusing each year on a predetermined theme. The European Institute for Gender Equality should become fully operational without delay, and all the necessary indicators should be devised to enable equality issues to be kept under review wherever they arise. The Commission’s directorates-general should set up coordinating machinery to provide permanent follow-up to gender equality and equal opportunities policies. The gender equality policies applying in various fields of activity, including the economic, financial, commercial, social, and budgetary spheres, have to based on an integrated approach. The Commission and the Member States should publicise examples of good practice and speak out against those cases in which women’s rights, and especially those of working women, are systemically violated; one matter to which particular attention should be drawn is the use of bonuses for ‘production’, ‘quality’, ‘productivity’, or ‘regular attendance’, the invariable purpose of which is to make maternity and paternity rights subject to conditions and create difficulties
