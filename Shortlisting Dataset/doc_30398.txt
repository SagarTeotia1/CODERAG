Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (20 March 2009) The Commission takes note of the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member regarding the area of reproductive health and infertility. However, Community actions in the field of public health must respect the responsibilities of Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. It is up to each Member State to determine the rules governing rights or duties of healthcare cover under their social security system. It is also up to each Member State to determine the conditions on which benefits provided by their sickness insurance scheme are granted. It is therefore the responsibility of the Member State concerned to address issues raised by the Honourable Member.
