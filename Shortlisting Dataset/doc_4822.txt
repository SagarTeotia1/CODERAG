detailed rules relating to visual inspections to detect parasites in fishery products. Lastly, Annex III, Chapter II, point F of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 provides that the authorities of a Member State are to carry out random testing to verify compliance with Community legislation on parasites. The Commission has not carried out specific studies and analyses on anisakis, as it considers that the biological cycle and harmfulness of this parasite have been subject to comprehensive scientific research over time. The parasite is present in all seas, including European waters. All types of fish may contain anisakis, but this parasite is found primarily in herring, mackerel, sprat, certain types of salmon and blue fish in general. Cooking or pre-freezing are the most effective ways of killing the larvae that may be present in the flesh of the fish.
