2005/29/EC does not preclude Member States from extending its application also to businesses through national law, whereas, however, this leads to differing levels of protection for businesses which are victims of misleading practices by business-directory companies in different Member States, J. whereas Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 defines “intra-Community infringement” as “any act or omission contrary to the laws that protect consumers’ interests … that harms, or is likely to harm, the collective interests of consumers residing in a Member State or Member States other than the Member State where the act or omission originated or took place; or where the responsible seller or supplier is established; or where evidence or assets pertaining to the act or omission are to be found”; whereas, however, that Directive does not apply to business-to-business misleading practices and therefore, in its current form, cannot be relied upon either to help the petitioners, K. whereas most petitioners name the business directory known as “European City Guide” (the activities of which directory have been the subject of legal and administrative action), but other business-directory companies such as “Construct Data Verlag”, “Deutscher Adressdienst GmbH” and “NovaChannel” are also mentioned; whereas, however, other business-directory companies engage in legitimate business practices, L. whereas the targets of these misleading business practices are, in the main, small businesses but also include professionals and even non-profit making entities such as non-governmental organisations, charities, schools and libraries and local social clubs such as band clubs, M. whereas the business-directory companies are often established in a Member State other than the victim's, making it difficult for victims to turn to national authorities for protection due to the existence of different interpretations in Member States of what is considered misleading; whereas victims also often find no redress from national legislative frameworks and consumer protection authorities because they are told that the law is intended to protect consumers and not businesses; whereas, being small businesses, most victims often lack the resources to pursue an effective remedy through litigation, and whereas self-regulatory mechanisms for directories are of little relevance as they are disregarded by those that engage in misleading advertising, N. whereas victims of these practices are rigorously pursued to pay up by the business-directory companies themselves or even by debt-collection agencies engaged by them; whereas victims complain that they feel distressed and threatened by these approaches and many of them often end up paying unwillingly in order to avoid further harassment, O. whereas victims who refuse to pay have – with a few exceptions – seldom been pursued in court, P. whereas a number of Member States have adopted initiatives, notably of an awareness-raising nature, among potentially affected companies and whereas this includes information-sharing, advice, alerting state enforcement authorities and in some cases maintaining a complaints register in order to tackle this problem, Q. whereas Austria has since 2000 changed its national Unfair Commercial Practices Law, and whereas Section 28a thereof now states: “It shall be prohibited to advertise, in the scope of business and for the purpose of competition, for registration in directories, such as yellow pages, telephone
