Reply (10 April 2007) On 25 January 2007 the EU Heads of Mission in Aschgabat asked the Turkmen government in a joint note to allow Mr Kyarizov to leave prison on humanitarian grounds. Furthermore, they asked that the demolition of the horse-stables owned by Mr Kyarizov before he was sentenced be suspended until an alternative site had been provided. There has been no official answer to the note yet, but the demolition was suspended. Mr Kyarizov's wife has now visited him twice in prison. She was allowed to take food, some clothes and medication. EU HOMs remain seriously concerned about his state of health. EUSR Ambassador Pierre Morel raised this specific case with all high Turkmen authorities during his recent visit (February 2007).
