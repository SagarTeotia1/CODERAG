Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (10 January 2007) 1. With regard to the new rules of origin for the generalised system of preferences (GSP) and the economic partnership agreements (EPAs), the Commission is still working on specific proposals. The proposal for GSP rules of origin will be endorsed by the Commission once the analytical work has been achieved, and the impact assessment completed. As regards the EPAs, the Commission is preparing the Community's negotiating position to be presented to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries at the beginning of 2007. In both cases, the Commission intends to make sure that all beneficiary countries are treated in a consistent manner. 2. The reform of preferential rules of origin aims at modernising, simplifying and making rules of origin more development-friendly. New rules will be put in place for all sectors, and the practical impacts of such a change are being assessed for the most sensitive sectors. The impact assessment will be published once available.
