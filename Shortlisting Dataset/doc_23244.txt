Answer given by Mr Šefčovič on behalf of the Commission (20 March 2012) The Commission would first like to inform the Honourable Member, for the sake of clarity, that an authorisation to work part-time can never be withdrawn for the cases listed under points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 55a(2) of the Staff Regulations (SR), as these entitlements to work part-time constitute an absolute right which cannot be restricted, even under exceptional circumstances. Regarding the cases listed under (d) and (e) of Article 55a(2), the authorisation may indeed be refused but only in exceptional circumstances and for overriding service-related reasons (see Article 55a(2) second paragraph). Similarly, as provided in Article 2, second paragraph, of Annex IVa of the SR, authorisation given pursuant to these provisions may be withdrawn, but only in exceptional cases and in the interests of the service. What constitutes such exceptional cases can only be determined following a case by case analysis taking account of the interest of the service and they can thus not be defined in abstract terms. The term ‘interest of the service’, in this respect means that the withdrawal is necessary for the proper functioning of the institution or, according to existing case law, when there are new circumstances which did not exist when the initial authorisation was given requiring the period for which the part-time work was granted to be shortened. Moreover, the competent authority is obliged to take into consideration all factors which may affect its decision including in particular, the interests of the member of staff concerned ( devoir de solicitude , Fürsorgepflicht ).
