WRITTEN QUESTION E-6273/09 by Nick Griffin (NI) to the Commission (15 December 2009) Subject: European Agency for Fundamental Rights Referring to the Commission’s response to me of 19 November, ref JLS/D-1/MFM/sv (2009) D17205, I have several additional questions: 1. Accepting that the Agency holds the details specified in Part 1 of the response, does any subsidiary or agency of the organisation, including the UK Management Board, or any other body connected to the organisation and based in the UK, hold records on any individual or organisation or political party in the UK? 2. Does the organisation or any subsidiary of the organisation, including the UK Management Board and its subsidiaries and agencies, have access to records of any individual or organisation or political party in the UK? 3. Further to the response in Part 3, has the organisation, including the UK Management Board, or any subsidiary or agency of either, held any relationship and/or exchange of services or money with Searchlight or its subsidiaries, connected charities or personnel? 4. How does the organisation carry out its research, activities and duties, and how does it collect its data and produce its analyses? 5. What UK organisations are members of the organisation’s Fundamental Rights Platform and involved in the work of the Agency? What records do they hold on individuals or political parties in the UK, do they supply the organisation with such intelligence or services and does the organisation remunerate them accordingly, on what basis and by what amount, in pound sterling?
