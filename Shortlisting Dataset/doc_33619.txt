WRITTEN QUESTION E-4215/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (29 August 2007) Subject: TRIPS and the Convention on Biological Diversity What is the Commission's view of proposals put forward by India, Brazil and other countries rich in biodiversity seeking to amend the TRIPS agreement to reflect the requirements of the Convention on Biological Diversity? Does the Commission agree that these proposals indicate a strong desire on the part of developing countries to maintain the integrity of various MEAs? What is the Commission's view of the approach of WTO Members such as the US and Australia that seem to suggest that the lack of WTO challenges to MEA trade measures is evidence of a well-functioning, mutually supportive WTO-MEA relationship? Does the Commission consider that procedural coordination among institutions responsible for trade and environment will be sufficient or does the Commission consider that a more substantive and political outcome to the negotiating mandate will be required? What steps has the Commission taken towards building a consensus in this regard? How confident is the Commission that there is strong support for an ambitious outcome to the Doha Ministerial Declaration 31(i) among developing-country WTO members, and what form does the Commission hope that agreement will take?
