the Commission and Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure that consumers have access to all information they need in order to make informed choices. The committee believes that consumers must have the right to access quickly product information, which must be easily comprehensible and presented in a transparent way. The Development Committee calls on the Commission to liaise with the international Fair Trade movement in supporting clear and widely-applicable criteria against which consumer assurance schemes can be assessed, underpinning consumer confidence in such schemes and consolidating the Fair Trade product sectors. The committee also calls on the Commission to launch specific "calls for proposals" with objectives targeted at Fair Trade in order to raise consumer awareness, support assurance schemes and labelling, as well as systematic data collection and assessment of effects across the EU. The committee also urges the Commission to develop a coherent policy for the promotion and protection of small and marginalised producers, including Fair Trade, incorporating their views as well as the views of the producers of other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards, in bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations, such as the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Finally, the report calls on the Commission to take the Fair Trade and other social and environmental trading approaches into account when formulating the EU trade policy.

The Commission is proposing to repeal legislation from 1986 which allows scheduled shipping operators to operate “conferences” which fix freight charges and manage vessel capacities, arguing that the industry no longer needs this type of protection and that it does not encourage cost-saving. In a report drawn up by Corien WORTMANN-KOOL (EPP-ED, NL), MEPs in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee give their backing to the repeal, but they insist that before the old system is entirely phased out, the Commission should first publish guidelines on what sorts of cooperation between shipping operators is allowed, to ensure there is legal certainty for all involved.
