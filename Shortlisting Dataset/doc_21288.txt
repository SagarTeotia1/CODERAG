WRITTEN QUESTION E-3259/05 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (19 September 2005) Subject: Water Framework Directive Is the Commission satisfied that the current arrangements for the ‘intercalibration’ process, intended to establish Europe‑wide standards for water quality, will deliver comprehensive and consistent standards for water quality and so provide a level playing field for all the industries affected? Is the Commission taking steps to ensure that EU-funded flood-risk management programmes are fully compatible with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive?
