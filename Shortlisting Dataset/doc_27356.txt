WRITTEN QUESTION E-4612/09 by Kriton Arsenis (S-D) to the Commission (29 September 2009) Subject: Reduction in the quality of drinking water in Halkidiki In recent years there have been numerous reports from research centres, universities, local associations and state inspection bodies concerning the poor quality of water in the prefecture of Halkidiki. In July 2009 an announcement by the region of Central Macedonia confirmed that the water in the areas of Kallikrateia, Triglia and Moudania was not drinkable. All the studies agree that the water of these regions is contaminated with heavy metals, pesticide residues and various dangerous chemicals resulting from uncontrolled use of pesticides, leaks of pollutants from legal and illegal rubbish dumps and from the region’s landfill sites, and a lack of biological treatment facilities in several areas of the prefecture. 1. Have the Greek authorities informed the Commission of the recent measurements of water quality in Halkidiki, the announcements by the region of Central Macedonia banning the consumption of water and the relevant complaints by civil society bodies and consumer organisations? 2. Are the Greek authorities infringing the provisions of the framework Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption? 3. Does the Commission know what management procedures are being followed by the region’s local and municipal authorities which do not have biological treatment facilities?
