Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2011) The issuing of a pension card is a matter of domestic law which falls under the competence of individual Member States and in this context the Commission does not intend to present a proposal for a European Pension Identity Card. However, the equal treatment of pensioners when moving within the European Union is a matter of EC law and pensioners receiving a pension from another Member State should be treated in the same way as pensioners of the host Member State in relation to advantages such as the ones to which the Honourable Member refers. Independently of the existence of a pension card, the Commission monitors the correct application of EC law on free movement of persons and equal treatment and has the capacity to take the appropriate action foreseen in the Treaty if it notes that this law is infringed. Moreover, Article 20 of Directive 123/2006/EC on Services in the internal market (the ‘Services Directive’) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:376:0036:0068:en:PDF stipulates that service providers may not discriminate on the grounds of the nationality or residence of the recipient unless there are objectively justified reasons to provide for differences in the conditions of access to their services. This Article is implemented in the legal order of the Member States. It is therefore primarily up to the relevant national authorities to enforce this provision upon service providers established in their territory. Citizens wishing to obtain assistance in dealing with the relevant authorities competent for the enforcement of these national implementing provisions may wish to contact the appropriate assistance bodies, whose details are available online http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/services/docs/services-dir/guides/bodies_designated_en.pdf .
