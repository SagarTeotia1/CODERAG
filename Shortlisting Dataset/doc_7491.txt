Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (5 January 2011) The EU is open to investment and we appreciate the contribution that official holders of foreign currencies can make to international financial stability. Furthermore, the Commission is advocating increased international cooperation, as can be seen in our position taken at the G20 summit. This collaborative approach involving all major global economies is the best way to sustain and foster the global economic recovery.
