Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2009) 1. Directive 2001/42/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment OJ L 197, 21.7.2001 . would appear not to be applicable in this particular case, as pipelines are projects. On the other hand, pipelines do come under the scope of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985, as amended, on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 ; OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 ; OJ L 156, 25.6.2003 . , also known as the Environmental Impact Assessment or EIA Directive. An EIA is mandatory in the case of pipelines for the transport of gas with a diameter of more than 800 millimetres and a length of more than 40 kilometres. For all other gas pipelines, Member States will determine, through a procedure known as screening, whether the project is to be made subject to an EIA. If projects are shown to have significant effects, an EIA is necessary. Member States have to ensure that any screening determinations are made available to the public. 2. As regards Community legislation on biodiversity, Articles 6(3) and 6(4) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive) OJ L 206, 22.7.1992 . define the procedure to be followed by national authorities before authorising plans or projects likely to have a significant impact on a Natura 2000 site (site of Community importance or Special Protection Area). National authorities are responsible for evaluating whether a project is likely to have a significant impact on the said sites and, if so, for following the procedure defined in the directive before approving the project. From the information provided in the Honourable Member's written question, the Commission has no elements to assess whether the abovementioned rules and procedures have been followed, or to identify any infringement of the related EC legislation. Nevertheless the Commission will contact the competent national authorities asking for additional information in order to clarify how the aforementioned provisions have been complied with. 3. The question indicates that the Commission has provided funding, on the basis of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 of 17 November 1986 on the protection of the Community's forests against atmospheric pollution, for the purpose of monitoring forest ecosystems in the area through which the methane gas pipeline will run. The funding from the regulation was not granted on a conditional basis and therefore the assessment of the environmental impact of the pipeline must be carried out independently from any funding provided by Community sources.
