Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (17 September 2010) The Commission is well aware of citizens' concerns on possible adverse health effects associated with the exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, the Commission has no competence to intervene on grounds of public health protection on specific decisions concerning the location or grounding of power lines. The responsibility for the protection of the public against the potential adverse health effect of such fields remains with the Member States. However, the Commission submitted in 1999 a proposal for a recommendation to the Council's approval Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300 GHz), OJ L 199, 30.7.1999 . to provide guidance on exposure limit values to the Member States. Since the adoption of the recommendation, the Commission reviews regularly the validity of the exposure guidelines proposed by the Recommendation 1999/519/EC through the independent Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) http://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_022.pdf . So far, in light of the relevant scientific opinions of the SCENIHR, no scientific rationale to revise the guidelines has emerged. It should be noted that the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) has in its recently published Ten-Year Network Development Plan 2010‑20 called on the grid operators to take into account the concerns of the general public regarding possible negative health effects from electric and magnetic fields when planning for new infrastructure. https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/SDC/TYNDP/TYNDP-final_document.pdf Regarding the use of undergrounding of transmission lines, the Commission asked in December 2009 ENTSO-E and the cable manufacturers European association Europacable to produce a paper on feasibility and technical aspects of partial undergrounding of extra high voltage power transmission lines. The paper is planned to be finalised soon.
