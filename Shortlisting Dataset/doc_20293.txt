Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (18 January 2008) The Commission had launched the review process of the trade defence instruments (TDI) in December 2006. A Green Paper was published on the functioning of our instruments followed by a wide-ranging public consultation. The Commission has evaluated the large number of replies by stakeholders and published its assessment on the external website of DG Trade. The replies confirmed that our trade defence system is both, necessary and, for the most part sound, durable and effective. But they also suggested ways in which we should consider improving the system. These concern mainly the transparency, predictability and accessibility of our instruments and also how we should use these instruments in the changing global economy. But even in a changing world some key principles will remain and there is no intention of encouraging or rewarding dumping whether by European outsourced companies or other exporters to the Community. While taking initiative in this regard to ensure that the European Union is fit for reaping the benefits of globalisation, the European Commission is fully aware of the challenges that relentless change poses to European workers and businesses. Reducing the social cost of change and restructuring to a minimum will be elementary for acceptance of change. Good anticipation under a partnership approach is an important element of the Commission's approach on restructuring and employment COM(2005)120 final. . As announced recently, this approach will be further followed and deepened in its future activities, e.g. through the adoption of another communication on anticipating and managing change and the launch of the second phase of the consultation of the European social partners on that matter in 2008.
