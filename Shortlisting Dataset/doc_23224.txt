WRITTEN QUESTION E-3332/05 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (23 September 2005) Subject: Human rights clause in EU-Chile Association Agreement Whilst not all national parliaments of the EU Member States have yet ratified the EU-Chile Association Agreement, the bulk of the agreement, particularly with reference to the trade chapter, has been applied since 1 February 2003. Under Principle 1, respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law are essential elements of the agreement, and the promotion of sustainable economic and social development and the equitable distribution of the benefits of the association are guiding principles for its implementation. However, notwithstanding the progress Chile has made in coming to terms with the human rights violations committed under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and the recent moves to reform the constitution in the direction of democratisation, there remains serious concerns over the status and treatment of the indigenous Mapuche people, who continue to suffer discrimination and political persecution. While the living standards of the rest of the country are improving, Mapuche in the south live in an impoverished enclave; they still do not enjoy full and equal rights under the constitution, particularly with reference to land ownership disputes, and are being persecuted through the government's recourse to anti-terrorism statutes to deal with organised Mapuche communities, which has brought severe restrictions on due process rights that are not justified by the alleged offences. Can the Commission, in an objective and transparent manner, explain the exact relationship between Chile's compliance (or lack thereof) with human rights standards and the implementation of the human rights clause within the EU-Chile Association Agreement, with specific reference to the indigenous Mapuche people?
