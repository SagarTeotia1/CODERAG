Commission proposal The legal basis for the proposed decision is Article 31 of the Treaty on European Union as amended by the Nice Treaty; it provides for Parliament merely to be consulted. The main purpose of the Commission's proposal for a decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record is - as indicated - to suggest practical ways of remedying the shortcomings in the current system, and it proposes action in just a few key areas: (a) it requires the Member States to notify each other straight away regarding any of their nationals who have been convicted of an offence; under the 1959 Convention the Member States are required to do so just once a year; (b) it establishes a five-day time limit for the receipt of a reply from the requested Member State; (c) with an obvious view to simplifying the practical data-transfer procedures, it provides that a request from a requesting Member State and a reply from a requested Member State must be accompanied by a standard form which is identical in all the Member States; (d) it provides definitions of 'criminal record' and 'conviction', since the legal systems in force in the 25 EU Member States do not currently recognise a single concept of 'criminal record', which may contain very different information on individuals, depending on the Member State concerned. 3. Proposed amendments The rapporteur broadly agrees with the Commission's overall approach and he has merely proposes a few, well-focused amendments designed to enhance the legislative text (which will be a practical tool in the hands of those responsible for operating the judicial system) and making it easier to use. Amendment 1 - Article 3: Own-initiative information on convictions With regard to this basic issue, the rapporteur considers that each central authority should inform the other Member States' central authorities of convictions of nationals of those Member States which are registered in the national criminal record immediately or in any event within three months . If the legislative text were to retain the vague concept whereby the central authorities will inform the other central authorities without delay , this could lead to unjustified delays in what should be a regular periodic updating of the central authorities' databases. Amendments 2 and 3 - Article 4: Request for information on convictions With regard to this aspect the rapporteur considers (in accordance with what has already been agreed by the Council) that a reply from a requested Member State may arrive within 10 working days of the date upon which the request was received (instead of the five working days proposed by the Commission - a time limit which would be difficult to meet), but that in urgent cases a reply should in all cases be received within 48 hours (which in many Member States is the minimum length of time required for it to be confirmed that an individual is or is not being held in custody). Again in order to make the text more immediately comprehensible to users of the system, the rapporteur considers it useful to
