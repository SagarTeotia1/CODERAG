Supplementary answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (11 January 2006) Eurostat, the statistical service of the Commission, does not collect data regarding the use of public transport in European cities. On the Commission’s request, the International Association of Public Transport (UITP) has provided the following data for 15 EU capital cities from its ‘Mobility in Cities’ database. Capital City % Public Transport Athens 30.1 Berlin 33.2 Brussels 18.6 Budapest 55.9 Copenhagen 15.0 Helsinki 34.6 Lisbon 36.4 London 26.8 Madrid 30.2 Paris 27.5 Prague 54.2 Rome 26.3 Stockholm 28.9 Vienna 46.6 Warsaw 64.0 The data should be read as follow: 1. The data show the percentage of mechanised trips made by public transport. Before and after transport, for example walking trips, are not taken into account. 2. The reference year is 2001. 3. The data refer to the full metropolitan area of each city, defined as the catchment area. 4. The data refer to an average day in an average week. 5. Given the limited comparability of mobility figures, these data are for general information only and cannot be used for detailed comparisons. 6. Drawing conclusions from the data is dangerous as the modal share of public transport partly depends on factors outside the scope of transport policy.
