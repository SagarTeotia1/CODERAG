WRITTEN QUESTION P-2007/07 by Niels Busk (ALDE) to the Commission (10 April 2007) Subject: Accumulation of decommissioned fishing boats in European ports Following the introduction of the days-at-sea scheme, numerous fishermen have opted to buy up fishing vessels and accumulate more days at sea over fewer boats. Under the common fisheries policy, fishing boats must be kept ready for sea even if they are no longer actively used for fishing. The result of this is an accumulation of decommissioned fishing boats in European ports. It must be possible to introduce a system whereby days at sea can be accumulated without decommissioned fishing boats marring the landscape in ports as ‘evidence’ and constituting a source of pollution. What will the Commission do to resolve this problem? When does the Commission expect a new system to enter into force?
