substances in pesticides, is necessary to minimise the problems relating to the quality of agricultural soils, G. whereas the priorities for soil policy must include the decline in biodiversity, the processes of physical and chemical degradation triggered by erosion, desertification , pollution and the decline in organic matter, H. whereas there is a wide diversity of soil problems among and within the Member States and candidate countries, and soil pollution is much less of a cross-border problem than air or water pollution; whereas the added value of European action lies principally in the exchange of information, know-how and best practice, I. whereas soil protection is a precondition for achieving, inter alia, the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC as regards preventing diffuse pollution, Directive 92/43/EEC as regards soil biodiversity and the Kyoto Protocol as regards the capacity of the soil and subsoil to retain CO 2 , J. whereas it is necessary to consider the causes of the process of soil degradation taking account of the specific features of each European region and, in particular, the problems linked to Mediterranean soils seriously affected by phenomena such as forest fires or desertification, 1. Calls on the Commission to present, by July 2004, the thematic strategy for soil protection which should be based on the strengthening of current policies and, through an integrated approach, should define problems, qualitative and quantitative objectives and the means by which they can be achieved, timetables and general principles for evaluation and monitoring geared to the following: – putting an end to the accumulation in soil of substances which pose an environmental and health hazard; – reversing the alarming trend towards erosion, compaction and sealing, the removal and contamination of soil; – protecting soil in its role in storing CO 2 , securing water resources and preserving biodiversity; – protecting soil for the sustainable production of food and renewable resources; 2. Urges the Commission to draw up by 2007, in cooperation with the Member States and the competent regional authorities, a scientific soil catalogue which should include the nature of the soil, its biography, health and vulnerability, degradation and erosion processes and contaminated areas, recognising the existence of high-value soils (in terms of agriculture, geology, ecology, history or the countryside) and the need to draw up recommendations for their conservation and sustainable use; stresses the importance of harmonising analytical methods to obtain comparable soil data; considers that the accessibility of existing information must also be improved, given that this is an important prerequisite for the necessary exchange of information and experience between Member States; 3. Calls on the Commission, in this context, to establish, when the scientific soil catalogue is drawn up, a link between soil protection and soil use, since any scientific and taxonomic classification of soil, although of great interest, would be less effective without the creation of mechanisms for the constant surveillance of soil use (monitoring increases in irrigation, reclassification of protected areas, urban development on wetlands, construction of infrastructure on fertile soil, etc.); considers that, taking account of the subsidiarity principle, such use-surveillance mechanisms should be implemented
