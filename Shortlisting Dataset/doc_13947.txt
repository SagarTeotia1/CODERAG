As a supplement to that answer, the Commission would inform the Honourable Member that it commissioned the survey in question and that the questionnaire was drawn up jointly by the Press and Communication DG and its contractor, TNS Sofres. It is aware of the limits to the question concerning countries that are a threat to world peace. Nevertheless, it considers that the replies obtained are indicative of worrying prejudices.
