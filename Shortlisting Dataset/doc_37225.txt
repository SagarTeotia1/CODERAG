Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (15 December 2008) As it stated in its answer to the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑4080/08 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/home.do?language=EN , the Commission was initially concerned that Irish law might not be fully compatible with the Community legislation, in particular as regards the specific exception allowed under Directive 2000/78/EC Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000. for recruitment by institutions the ethos of which is based on religion or faith. Directive 2000/78/EC has a special provision allowing for a justified exception to the principle of equal treatment on the grounds of religion and belief (Article 4.2). Under Article 4.2, a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation's ethos, can justify differences of treatment based on religion. Article 4.2 also states that ‘this difference of treatment shall be implemented taking account of Member States' constitutional provisions and principles, as well as the general principles of Community law, and should not justify discrimination on another ground’. The Commission believes that national law, when transposing Article 4.2, should ensure an appropriate balance between on one side freedom of religion and religious institutions, and on the other side, respect for the principle of non-discrimination. National law should reflect such a balance, ensuring that any limitations to non-discrimination rules be based on appropriate justifications and respect the principle of proportionality. As mentioned in the answer to Written Question E‑4080/08 , in view of the above and after receiving detailed explanations from the Irish Government, the Commission considers that Irish legislation is compatible with the directive, in particular when that legislation is interpreted within the general context of the whole Irish legal order, including the Irish Constitution and relevant case law of the Supreme Court.
