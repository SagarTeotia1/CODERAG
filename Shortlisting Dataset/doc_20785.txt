CRIS Public Hearing on Global Governance This week's Public Hearing on Global Governance will be held on the 25th March in the József Antall Building, Room 4Q1. After last week's Public Hearing on European Economic Governance it is now important to tackle issues from a wider perspective in this ever more global world. Panel I of the Hearing consists of Mr Bert van Selm (International Monetary Fund), Mr Sony Kapoor (Re-Define), and Mr Stephan Schulmeister (Austrian Institut for Economic Research). This panel will cover topics such as global governance, global imbalances, reform of the the Financial Institutions and global regulation of financial markets including tax havens and the Financial Transaction Tax. Panel II includes Mr Amar Bhattacharya (Director of the G24), Mr Arunabha Ghosh (Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs) and Ms Núria Molina (Director of Eurodad). This panel will focus more on issues such as the impact of the crisis on developing countries, trade and development and climate change. The keynote speech will be made by Mr Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, President of Notre Europe. It promises to be an interesting and lively Hearing which will once again widen our knowledge of the issues that have been caused by the recent financial, economic and social crisis and how we can continue to tackle them. 20100324CAN71225 Hearings Page
