the 2003 Better Regulation Action Plan - in order to make EU legislation more coherent and to reduce the overall volume of texts in selected policy areas; 83. Stresses that it is of paramount importance to make Europe work better and to bring it closer to the citizens, by creating a more open, responsive and democratic Union, and therefore emphasises the need for a properly coordinated campaign by the European Council, Parliament and the Commission to ensure ratification of the Constitution and its entry into force on 1 November 2006; Petitions 84. Underlines the importance of the petitions process as a source of information on faulty implementation and/or enforcement of EU law; expresses its strong disappointment at the lack of effective, speedy follow-up by the Commission in dealing with petitions, which clearly highlights organisational problems within the Commission and a lack of coordination with the Member States; Budgetary accountability and administrative reform 85. Welcomes the Commission's emphasis on value for money and accountability in the communications, as well as the reference to the need for an effective roadmap aimed at securing a positive statement of assurance on the execution of annual budgets; 86.

Requests the Commission, as already foreseen in 2003, to submit a formal proposal for a legal base for the so-called 'Info-points/Carrefours', as well as for the new generation of conventions between the Commission and Member States and of programmes for grants after 2006; 91. Calls on the Commission to inform Parliament as soon as possible on the status of implementation of its own internal reform process, launched by the previous Commission, as well as on its continuing plans for pursuing and completing such reform; Fight against fraud 92.
