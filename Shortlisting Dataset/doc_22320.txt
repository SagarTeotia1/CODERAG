WRITTEN QUESTION E-2557/04 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (21 October 2004) Subject: European Commission law-breaking What legally enforceable procedures are laid down in EU treaties or in law so as to ensure that the Commission meets its legal obligations? For example, if an EU Directive requires the Commission to take steps by a certain date, and it fails to comply with this legal requirement, what action may be taken to ensure compliance, what persons or institutions may initiate such proceedings, who would investigate them, what court or other body would consider the conclusions of such an investigation, what sanctions may be imposed and by whom, and do these apply to the entire institution or to individual Commissioners?
