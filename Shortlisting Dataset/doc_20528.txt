WRITTEN QUESTION P-5937/07 by Adriana Poli Bortone (UEN) to the Commission (27 November 2007) Subject: Cut in funding for rail infrastructures in Southern Italy Trenitalia and the Italian Government have decided to cut funding for rail infrastructure, which will result in many railway lines being closed, particularly along Italy's main North-South axis. Cutting funding and rail connections to the South will mean curtailing opportunities for progress and for the exchange of expertise and good practice. Yet free movement of persons is one of Europe's underlying principles, and there can be no freedom of trade unless all European citizens have the same possibilities, and equal opportunities to make use of them. Bearing in mind that the Commission continues to provide funds for regions covered by the ‘Convergence Objective’ (formerly Objective 1) in order to improve their competitiveness and encourage their development, 1. Would it not be appropriate to publicly call the Italian Government to account concerning these reprehensible cuts in funding and rail services, which will mainly affect Southern Italy and the most disadvantaged regions, such as Puglia? 2. Does the Commission agree that these cuts are a severe blow not only to Italy but also, and above all, to the development of the TEN networks (‘Corridor 8’, etc.), and will have the effect of cutting Italy off from the rest of Europe?
