a broad agenda including, as well as reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, investment, public procurement, the protection of intellectual property rights, cooperation regarding competition and trade protection instruments, trade facilitation, and a binding dispute settlement mechanism. As to the Doha round, Parliament regrets the fact that, despite Parliament's recommendations that negotiation of the agreement with Member State should be decoupled from the WTO's Doha Round, the delays in the negotiations with Mercosur have led to their temporary de facto subordination to the development and finalisation of the Doha Round. Parliament believes that the two processes, rather than being mutually exclusive, are complementary. MEPs stress the importance of core labour standards and decent jobs for the development of Mercosur; states therefore that the agreement must include a specific agenda on decent work tailor-made for Mercosur Member States and a commitment by the EU to offer all necessary assistance in achieving that agenda. Finally, the House considers that in addition to the repressive aspect concerning the fight against drugs, the agreement should insist on delivering aid to farmers to help them start new alternative production. -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061010BRI11531 FULL-TEXT DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061010BRI11531 ITEM-005-EN DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061010BRI11531 ITEM-007-EN DOC XML V0//EN Economic and monetary affairs Call to remove unjustifiable barriers to competition in the professions 2006-10-13 - 10:35 Parliament has given a welcome to dialogue between the Commission, Member States and professional bodies aimed at dismantling unjustified or harmful barriers to competition in professional services. With 534 votes in favour, 62 against and 9 abstentions, Parliament adopted an own-initiative report, drawn up by Jan Christian EHLER (EPP-ED, DE) in reaction to the Commission’s latest communication on the issue. It says effective and transparent self-regulation can be appropriate, but that Member States should ensure it does not damage consumer interests. MEPs support the adoption of codes of conduct by professional service providers. Parliament acknowledges the right to issue regulations based on traditional, geographic and demographic specificities, but emphasises that such rules should restrict competition as little as possible, and that substantive reform of the existing system is needed to help attain the Lisbon targets. MEPs say that the mandatory fixed or minimum fees and a ban on negotiating fees based on results might be detrimental to the quality of service to the public and to competition. They therefore call on Member States to overcome these constraints through measures which are less restrictive. MEPs want restrictions on advertising by professionals to be largely dispensed with, limited only to duly justified exceptional cases. Parliament urges the Commission to examine more carefully the expected impact of the full removal of unnecessary obstacles to competition, including on sectors that have limited resources or that are restricted to certain regions. Finally the report raises the issue of subdividing regulatory protection by category of consumer group, suggesting this may need further analysis. -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061010BRI11531
