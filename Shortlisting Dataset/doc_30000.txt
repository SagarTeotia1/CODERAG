necessary to combine a range of mutually supportive and corrective policies in order to strike the right balance between sustainable mobility, the economic significance of the transport sector and environmental aspects; 19. Underlines that the role of maritime transport in the European economic system as a whole should be further strengthened and therefore welcomes the Action Plan for the new EU Integrated Maritime Policy adopted by the Commission in 2007 and looks forward to its effective implementation, as well as to the monitoring, reporting and simplification of administrative procedures where necessary, through the related initiatives identified in the 2008 Work Programme; 20. Welcomes the initiatives proposed by the Commission to strengthen common aviation safety rules and to promote new technologies in this sector, inter alia by improving the ATM and SESAR, in order to contribute to achieving sustainability objectives; 21. Stresses that greater importance must be attached to passenger rights, especially the protection of passengers travelling long distances by bus and coach and of rail and ship passengers; 22. Stresses the need to protect biodiversity as such from human pressure, pollution, soil degradation and climate change and considers it essential to integrate biodiversity into other policy areas, such as agriculture, soil protection or biofuels; calls for the setting at European level of clear and measurable targets, so that the situation can be monitored, and calls for urgent and concrete action in order to meet the EU objective of halting biodiversity loss by 2010; 23. Reiterates the strategic significance of energy for the EU’s future; in that connection, considers that the Commission’s initiatives to liberalise the energy market will help to create an effective and competitive energy market; 24. Considers, further, that a distinction must be drawn between the evolution of the electricity market and that of the gas market, where liberalisation must tackle a highly monopolistic system which is greatly dependent on supplies from third countries; 25. Welcomes the Commission’s proposal for a package of measures aimed at encouraging the use of renewable energies in the European Union; calls on the Member States to start its implementation in 2009; 26. Calls on the Member States to implement the action plan adopted by the Commission to improve the energy market, to speed up the introduction of new technologies, to diversify and secure supplies, to control demand and promote energy efficiency, notably through better coordination of national energy policies; An integrated approach to migration 27. Considers that migration and social integration are two sides of the same coin and represent key challenges; in that connection, supports the Commission initiatives concerning the management of migration flows at European level, education and integration policies with a view to establishing a clear and safe framework for economic migrants, in particular skilled workers, which clarifies their obligations and rights; 28. Considers that successful integration also depends on effective action against illegal migration and human trafficking; in that connection, supports the Commission action to protect the EU’s external borders using common tools and believes that the External Border Agency can play a major role in this field, through the
