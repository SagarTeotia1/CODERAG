WRITTEN QUESTION E-6972/08 by Marco Cappato (ALDE) to the Commission (6 January 2009) Subject: Replacement of portable computer operating systems Italian consumers have reported problems with regard to the purchasing of portable computers compulsorily equipped with pre‑installed operating systems. In particular, if one decides to replace the operating system provided on the purchase of an HP computer, it has in some cases proved technically impossible to uninstall the pre‑installed system (Windows Vista) and replace it with a different one. It is not possible to solve the problem with the recovery discs supplied with the portable computer and, with all the complications involved, the only solution seems to be to replace the appliance, which is something which the producer often renders impossible. With reference also to the answer to Question E‑5147/07 by Dirk Sterckx, could the Commission reply to the following questions: Does it have statistics on the percentage of portable computers sold with pre‑installed operating systems, and what type are these? Does it have information on the technical unfeasibility of uninstalling pre‑installed systems and, if not, will it conduct a fact‑finding enquiry into the current situation? Does it not consider that ‑ irrespective of business agreements between hardware and software producers ‑ there is a need to guarantee the right of consumers not to use the software provided with their purchase and to change it at their pleasure? Will it adopt initiatives to counter the unfair practices pursued by producers who restrict that consumer option?
