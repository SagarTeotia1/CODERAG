Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2012) The Commission has undertaken a series of efforts to provide health information to patients so that they can take well-informed health decisions. 1. The European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing has identified health literacy, patient empowerment, ethics and adherence programmes using innovative tools and services as a key area for innovation. In its Strategic Implementation Plan, the Partnership proposed an action aiming by 2014 to deliver tangible adherence approaches for various chronic diseases in at least 30 EU regions by 2014. An increase in therapy compliance would result in better cost-effectiveness of treatment. 2. The Commission collects comparable data on self-declared unmet needs for healthcare services, selected surgical procedures, cancer screening and on health technology such as number of magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography scanners per Member State. This data is available at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/health/public_health/data_public_health/database The rare diseases database Orphanet co-funded by the Commission gives public access e.g. to an encyclopaedia of rare diseases, an inventory of orphan drugs and ongoing research projects. The Commission is developing a health wikipedia Heidi, giving public access to evidence-based information e.g. on health status, systems or diseases.
