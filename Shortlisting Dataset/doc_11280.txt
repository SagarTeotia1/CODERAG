the increasing use of small commercial vehicles on road safety in connection with training, driving and rest times and speed-limiting devices; calls on the Commission to forward the results of this examination to the European Parliament as quickly as possible, if necessary in conjunction with a legislative proposal; 17. Recalls that many fatalities are caused by driver fatigue, as has been demonstrated by a British study http://www.thinkroadsafety.gov.uk/ which found that fatigue is the cause of around 20% of accidents on long journeys on trunk roads and motorways; calls on the Commission to publish statistics on the overall situation in Europe and to support measures to counter this problem; 18. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and their regional authorities to pay particular attention to the protection and safety of vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists; 19. Is worried about the safety of those vulnerable road users; including young people, for whom the death rate is particularly high; notes that the risk of death in motorcycle or moped travel is 17 times higher than in car travel and that walking or cycling is up to nine times riskier; stresses that safety needs to be significantly improved not only for car occupants but also for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists; highlights the need to focus on road safety education, legislation and control measures on higher-risk groups through a more holistic approach; calls on the Commission to propose effective measures to ensure that all vulnerable road users benefit from maximum protection - such as hazard warning lights for the safety of two-wheeled vehicles; maintains that all road users should be made aware of the risks and of ways to reduce them; welcomes the EU-funded New Programme for the Assessment of Child Seats (NPACS) that establishes harmonised test and rating protocols; calls on the Commission to investigate whether child safety could be given higher priority in the Community road safety policy, whether extra attention to pedestrian safety could be brought to bear in European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP) crash tests and in the introduction of the second phase of Directive 2003/102/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 relating to the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users before and in the event of a collision with a motor vehicle and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC OJ L 321, 6.12.2003, p. 15. ; 20. Considers that proper, regular enforcement is of crucial importance for the improvement of road safety; 21. Points out that enforcing compliance with existing road traffic rules would dramatically improve road safety as most accidents are the result of the non-respect of traffic rules; especially emphasises the importance of compliance with speed, blood alcohol limits, medicine and drug intake as well as with rules on the use of seat belts and helmets noting that these, primarily fall within the competence of the Member States but are in urgent need of coordination and dissemination of best practice; especially welcomes the Recommendation of the European Commission of 17 January 2001 of a
