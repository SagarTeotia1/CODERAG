WRITTEN QUESTION E-0380/08 by Ashley Mote (NI) to the Commission (4 February 2008) Subject: Is the single payment scheme working? How does the Commission plan to regain effective financial control of the single payment scheme when it now knows that 28.9 % of payments checked by the Court of Auditors contained errors? How does the Commission plan to regain control in Greece in particular, given that the Greek Government has been breaking the rules over the payment schemes to farmers for sultanas and currants? How does the Commission answer the criticism of the Court, which said: ‘For 2006 the Court has confirmed continuing failure to implement key controls, namely: claims handling, inspection procedures, animal database integrity and the Land Parcel Identification System. Some 850 million euro per year is paid to farmers under these unsatisfactory control conditions. For the period 1996-2005 the Commission has imposed corrections totalling 479 million euro, equivalent to some 6 % of the expenditure declared.’ ‘The SPS has led to a substantial increase in the number of hectares in respect of which direct aid is paid and beneficiaries. The Court has also noted among them railway companies (England), horse riding/breeding clubs (Germany and Sweden) and golf/ leisure clubs and city councils (Denmark and England).’ The Auditors believe this is ‘inappropriate’. The question is: what is being done to stop these misappropriations of public money?
