Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (1 March 2010) The Commission together with Members of the Parliament and other stakeholders has been working since late 2008 with the European hospitality industry, represented by HOTREC Hotels, Restaurants & Cafés in Europe. , to improve hotel fire safety. In the absence of harmonisation legislation at EU level on this issue, the Commission has encouraged the development of a self-regulatory approach by the hospitality industry. In this context, HOTREC has developed a so-called Hotel Fire Safety MBS (Management, Building and Systems) Methodology, which sets out detailed requirements for increasing the level of fire safety in hotels in Europe. An integral part of this methodology is the special attention that needs to be given to the young, elderly and disabled, aimed at ensuring that evacuation procedures are adapted to the needs of these more vulnerable hotel users. The Commission remains committed to the success of the self-regulatory approach and is pursuing its contacts with the industry to this end. Should the hotel industry fail to achieve the self-regulation objectives that it has set itself, the Commission will consider alternative approaches. Any future action should certainly take into account the needs of special groups of users.
