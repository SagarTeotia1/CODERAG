16 May 2000 JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure by the following Members: Ahern, Lambert and Echerer, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Cossutta, Morgantini and Brie, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group Blokland, on behalf of the EDD Group Banotti, Doyle, Hume, De Rossa, Gallagher, Fitzsimons, Collins, Andrews, Hyland and Crowley replacing motions by: ‑ the Verts/ALE Group ( B5-0414/2000 ) ‑ the UEN Group ( B5-0421/2000 ) on safety problems at British Nuclear Fuels’ Sellafield site The European Parliament, – having regard to the European Union’s duties under the Euratom Treaty, and specifically Chapters 3 and 7 thereof dealing with health and safety and safeguards respectively, as well as the more general duty to promote sustainable development and environmental protection under the EU Treaty and Article 6 of the EC Treaty, – having regard to all its previous resolutions relating to Sellafield, A. whereas in recent months British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) has had damning criticism levelled at it in reports by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), firstly on the falsification of mixed oxide nuclear fuel (MOX) data, and secondly on safety procedures and the implementation of safety recommendations, B. whereas these problems highlight again the absence of a proper legal base for nuclear safety, which leaves EU citizens at risk from installations in neighbouring states, C. whereas the European Commission is committed under the OSPAR Convention to work towards substantial reductions in radioactive discharges to the sea by this year, and close to zero concentrations in the marine environment by 2020, 1. Severely condemns the falsification of the MOX test results by BNFL and the low levels of safety at BNFL and, while welcoming the management changes at the company and the BNFL programme to improve the safety of their operations, does not see this as at all adequate in terms of meeting the genuine concerns of citizens or those of neighbouring states; 2. Affirms that the unacceptable levels of radioactive pollution in the north-east Atlantic and the Irish Sea are essentially due to the reprocessing of spent fuel at Sellafield; 3. Calls for the immediate cessation of reprocessing at Sellafield, and supports the resolution by the Irish and Danish Governments to the OSPAR meeting in June to that effect; 4. Also calls for the permanent cessation of MOX production at the pilot MDF plant, and for the new BNFL MOX plant not to be licensed; 5. Calls on the UK Government to consider a change in the role of Sellafield to one of a body dealing appropriately with its part of the inheritance of the British nuclear industry, under the strictest direct government control, whereby all of the materials, including the plutonium, currently on site not due to be returned to commercial clients would be classified as waste, and where the production of the vitrification plant would be greatly increased, if necessary with French help, so as to make all such waste as safe as possible well before the 2015 deadline specified by the NII; 6. Calls on the Council
