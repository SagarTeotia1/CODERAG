Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (20 August 2010) 1. The Via do Infante in the region of Algarve was partly co-financed with European Union support, namely from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), between Vila real the Santo António and Alcantarilha. Most of the funding (EUR 132.9 million) was made during the 1st Community support framework (QCA I) between 1990 and 1993. Only a minor part was financed in the period 2000‑06 (EUR 9.1 million for the section between Guia and Alcantarilha). 2. The SCUTs of Beira Interior, Litoral e Alta, Interior Norte and Grande Porto received financing from the ERDF, although it was a minor percentage of the total investment for these roads. The SCUT Beira Interior, Litoral e Alta was awarded EUR 7.3 million, the SCUT Interior Norte received EUR 7.8 million and the SCUT Grande Porto received EUR 12.5 million, which represents 0.5 %, 1.4 % and 1.8 %, respectively, of the total project costs. 3 and 4. The Member State would only have to inform the Commission and re-examine the funding analysis for a period of five years after the date of decision, according to Article 30(4) of Regulation 1260/99 Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, OJ L 161, 26.6.1999. . The Member State shall verify whether the adoption of new operation measures, such as the introduction of a toll system, might imply a reduction of the assistance granted. In the case of the Via do Infante, most of the financing was made more than 15 years ago. A similar situation applies to the other SCUT financed by the ERDF (Beira Interior, Litoral e Alta, Interior Norte and Grande Porto), during the period 2000‑06. In both cases the decisions approving these projects are already older than five years so the introduction of a toll system will not imply any revision of the assistance granted from the ERDF.
