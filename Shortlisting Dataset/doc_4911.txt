Question for written answer E-005571/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Dan Jørgensen (S&D) (9 June 2011) Subject: Commission's follow-up to point 68 of Decision 1/CP.16 on effective ways to address deforestation At the Climate Summit (COP16) in Cancun the EU made a commitment in point 68 of Decision 1/CP.16 to combat deforestation effectively. Point 68 of Decision 1/CP.16 reads as follows: ‘Encourages all Parties to find effective ways to reduce the human pressure on forests that results in greenhouse gas emissions, including actions to address drivers of deforestation’. This means that all EU Member States have promised to be involved in identifying and removing the underlying causes of deforestation. The term ‘drivers of deforestation’ covers a whole range of direct and indirect causes of deforestation. Direct causes include commercial logging and the conversion of forest to agricultural land, e.g. for cattle farms or plantations (oil palms, soya, coffee, biofuels, etc.). Mining and infrastructure development also play an important role. One of the main indirect causes of deforestation is global economic growth. The rising demand for biofuels — ironically on the grounds of protecting the climate — is another indirect factor of increasing importance. How does the Commission intend to follow up the decision taken in point 68 of Decision 1/CP.16 and ensure that the EU contributes towards reducing the human pressure on forests both worldwide and in the EU itself?
