2004/C 783 E/099 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3120/03 by Christopher Huhne (ELDR) to the Commission (22 October 2003) Subject: Noise pollution Does the Commission intend to make available funding opportunities for local projects that will tackle the adverse effects of noise pollution in rural areas, for example, noise reduction barriers on motorways that run close to residential areas? Can the Commission state how the Environmental Noise Directive will assist people living in rural areas but who suffer from the adverse effects (a reduced quality of life, stress) of persistent noise from nearby motorways?
