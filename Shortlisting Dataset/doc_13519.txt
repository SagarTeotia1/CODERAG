production has increased by 14%. This is a disaster for these countries and their people. The authors of the plan want the crucial nature of cotton as a product for these producer countries to be recognised at the multilateral negotiations. They want measures to be adopted to offset losses caused by subsidies, pending their total abolition in the short term. The countries that have signed the initiative are all ACP states. President Kerekou is therefore calling for the support mechanism provided for under the Cotonou Agreements to be applied. Other funding measures should be brought into play in future to diversify farm production in the countries of central and western Africa to make them less dependent on cotton exports, as the future of this industry is "unpredictable and under threat" , in Mr Kerekou's words. Bashir KHANBHAI (EPP-ED, UK) and Michel-Ange SCARBONCHI (EUL/NGL, F) argued that genuine development would mean not having the economy of a country based on exports of a single raw material but instead creating a cotton processing industry. Most MEPs were in favour of abolishing subsidies. Michael GAHLER (EPP-ED, D) said that in future the principle should be "trade not aid" . But Miguel Angel MARTINEZ MARTINEZ (PES, E) took a slightly different angle, pointing to the different sensibilities on these matters between Parliament's Development and Agriculture Committees. 10.09.2003 Committee on Development and Cooperation In the chair: Marieke SANDERS-TEN HOLTE (ELDR, NL) Press enquiries: Armelle Douaud- tel.
