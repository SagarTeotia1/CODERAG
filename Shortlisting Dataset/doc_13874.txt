WRITTEN QUESTION P-6267/08 by Karin Riis-Jørgensen (ALDE) to the Commission (17 November 2008) Subject: Illegal state aid to the Danish State Railways (DSB) On 10 September 2008, the Commission notified that it was initiating a formal procedure to investigate whether the Danish State Railways (DSB) had received illegal aid from the Danish State. I welcome the Commission's decision and would also refer to the Commission's previous answers to Questions H‑0256/05 and P‑5502/06. Following a call for tenders, the Danish State awarded the contract for transport in the Øresund region to a DSB subsidiary in 2007. There are a number of elements in this case to suggest that illegal state aid may have been given to the DSB subsidiary, e.g. in the form of possible operational support for rolling stock. Is the Commission aware of this latest situation? If so, will the Commission include this in the above formal investigation procedure?
