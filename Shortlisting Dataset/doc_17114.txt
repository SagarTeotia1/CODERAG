WRITTEN QUESTION E-4196/05 by Margrietus van den Berg (PSE) to the Council (16 November 2005) Subject: Statements by President Ahmadinejad of Iran President Ahmadinejad of Iran recently said that Israel should be ‘wiped off the map’, a statement which he made at the time of a terrorist attack on Israel. European heads of government have already said that such statements are unacceptable. Can the Council indicate what specific measures it will adopt in the next few days to make it clear to Iran that such statements are disproportionate and that Europe — the most significant wielder of ‘soft power’ — will not accept them? What political sanctions, for example in the field of trade policy, will the Council propose to the UN Security Council to make it clear that ‘soft power’ does not mean that those who deploy it will stand idly by and take no action?
