Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (1 July 2005) The Commission is aware that the company Daval is developing a medicinal product named Aimspro based on hyperimmune goat serum, which is foreseen for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. No marketing authorisation has been issued to date in the Community. The marketing authorisation process for medicinal products is mandatory and serves to verify whether a product is of high quality, safety and efficacy from a conceptual point of view (Directive 2001/83/EC Directive 2001/83/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 311, 28.11.2001. , as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC for national authorisations OJ L 136, 30.4.2004 . and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Community authorisations Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency, OJ L 136, 30.4.2004. ). The competent authorities shall only issue a marketing authorisation if there is sufficient proof for a positive benefit-risk-ratio. For Aimspro, the central authorisation process will be mandatory. No application for a central marketing authorisation in line with EC legislation has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency EMEA for Aimspro, thus, currently, the product cannot be legally placed on the market and administered to patients within a regular therapy. Currently, it is only through authorised and closely monitored clinical trials, that such products may be administered as ‘investigational medicinal products’ under the conditions defined in Directive 2001/20/EC Directive 2001/20/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, OJ L 121, 1.5.2001. . The concrete manufacturing of a product has to be evaluated independently of the marketing authorisation or other legal arrangements, such as clinical trials. However, Member States shall only issue an authorisation for manufacturing, if — by the conditions applied to the manufacturing — they can ensure a high quality product (Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC). This includes the application of defined standards, such as good manufacturing practice (GMP) principles (Directive 2003/94/EC Commission Directive 2003/94/EC of 8 October 2003 laying down the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products for human use, OJ L 262, 14.10.2003. ), further detailed and regularly updated in the GMP guide http://pharmacos.eudra.org/F2/pharmacos/gmp_doc.htm . Following Directives 2001/20/EC and 2003/94/EC, GMP requirements for the manufacturing of investigational medicinal products became applicable in 2004. The abovementioned directives are addressed to the Member States. According to the subsidiarity principle, Member States have the primary obligation to implement and enforce the said legal requirements. The competent United Kingdom authority, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA, discovered that Daval´s contract manufacturer did not
