a bonus of £275.000 in addition to his total remuneration package of £347.758 for the year to December 2001; Vanni Treves, who took over as EL chairman in February 2001, was given a bonus of £250.000 in addition to his remuneration of £58.750 ." On this issue Mr. Thomson explained in H8 that the decision to award these bonuses was reached "by the EL remuneration committee, chaired by Sir Philip Otton, and unanimously endorsed by the Society's Board. The Board agreed that the payments were appropriate, fair, justly deserved and certainly not overgenerous." (see also EL AGM, May2002) In suggesting an explanation on how the need for the 16% cut in policy values of July 2001 had arisen, Mr. SLATER submitted a chart WE34, page 2; data based on findings of the Penrose Report. showing that, over more than a decade, EL had not balanced its policy values with asset values, thus accumulating substantial deficits every year from 1989 to 2000, with peaks of 28% in 1990 and 20% in 1994. As a result of this " policy of declaring total bonuses in excess of actual investment performance encouraged hundreds of thousands of innocent new investors and the Society expanded hugely. Equitable Life's senior management clearly recognised the risks they were taking. On 27 June 2001 the new board of directors heard Chief Executive Charles Thomson’s view of the level of surplus he would have expected at the end of 1999. Thomson commented that at the beginning of 2000, the excess of policy values over the value of assets was approximately 3%, which would have been within the acceptable range. In response to a question, Thomson confirmed that under normal actuarial principles he would have expected there however to have been an excess in the value of assets over policy values of perhaps 6-7% at that time. At the beginning of 2000 the Society was short of assets (or had voted excessive bonuses) of about 10% (3%+7%) or £2½ billion. The loss of the GAR case in July 2000 increased this shortage to £4 billion. This was approximately the amount recovered by the 16% cut of policy values on 16th July 2001." WE34, page 3-4. Referring to the outcome of the Hyman litigation and its consequences, WE 46 cited Mr. Ned CAZALET, an advisor to the UK Treasury on life insurance, saying of the GAR policyholders : "They just shot themselves in the head. They could win a court victory. The question is: What are the consequences of winning? The Equitable is left facing a possible bill of £1.5 billion to cover the guaranteed annuity rates. It does not have that kind of money to spare." Wrapping up the GAR issue on a more informal note, Mr. CAZALET concluded: " Think of the Equitable as a box of Smarties. The teacher promises a group of children four each. But the tube is smaller than the teacher thought and, when the sweets are shared between the whole class, there are only enough for three each. The disappointed group demands the promise be kept.
