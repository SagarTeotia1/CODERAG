WRITTEN QUESTION E-4479/06 by Herbert Bösch (PSE) to the Commission (20 October 2006) Subject: Construction of Spata Airport, Athens — incorrect payment of taxes In summer 2004, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apparently expressed its intention within the Commission to inform the tax authorities in Greece and Germany that the company chosen to construct Spata Airport in Athens, a project supported by Community funding, may not have paid taxes correctly. 1. Can the Commission indicate whether the tax authorities have in fact received information from OLAF? 2. If so, when was this information sent, and what action has been taken by the national authorities?
