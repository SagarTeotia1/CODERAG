Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (31 July 2008) 1. The Commission recalls its reply to the Written Question P‑3513/08 by Ms Harms. 2. Based on the information received from the Slovenian competent authority and confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the radiological event on 4 June 2008 at the Krsko-Nuclear power plant did not led to a release of radioactivity into the environment. The Slovenian national network for the environmental monitoring of radioactivity carries out a continuous monitoring of the levels of radioactivity in the air, water and soil and it is operational at regional and national levels. The functioning of this network is verified by the Commission, in accordance with Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty. A verification mission took place in Slovenia in June 2006 and did not reveal any shortcomings at and around the Krško-Nuclear power plant site, nor on the operation of the said national monitoring network on the Slovenian territory. 3. The Western Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) carried out a review of the Slovenian installation and regulatory body during the accession process issuing 72 recommendations in the year 2000. These were implemented as part of the accession of Slovenia to the European Union. The Commission considers that a high level of nuclear safety is a key element for the use and development of nuclear energy in the EU. However, nuclear safety is the sole responsibility of Member States and therefore ‘Community legislation on nuclear safety’ that the Honourable Member refers to does not exist. In order to consider the role of Community wide rules, the Commission has set up the High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management, comprising senior officials from national regulatory or nuclear safety authorities from the 27 Member States, with the mandate of progressively developing a common understanding and, eventually, additional European rules on nuclear safety.
