Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (20 May 2008) The Commission wishes to point out that Community law does not currently cover the alleged instances of discrimination on grounds of nationality, age or residential location to which the Honourable Member refers in respect of the availability of National Health Service (NHS) treatment and drugs in the United Kingdom. Discrimination based on nationality is explicitly excluded from the scope of both Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin OJ L 180, 19.7.2000. and Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation OJ L 303, 2.12.2000. . Discrimination on such grounds could amount to indirect discrimination under Article 2(2) of Directive 2000/43/EC if a particular ethnic or racial group is disproportionately affected and the measure is not justified or proportionate. As regards age, Directive 2000/78/EC covers the employment field only, not access to health. Finally, the Commission points out that residential location is not one of the grounds covered by Article 13 of the EC Treaty. In addition, the Commission recalls that the organisation of healthcare systems and the funding of medicinal products fall within the responsibility of each Member State. In particular, the competent national or local authorities are free to designate the medicinal products that they wish to finance under their social security scheme, provided that their decisions are made in accordance with Council Directive 89/105/EEC of 21 December 1988 Directive 89/105/EEC of 21 December 1988 relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion within the scope of national health insurance system, OJ L 40, 11.2.1989. and comply with the rules of the Treaty on free movement of goods.
