Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2011) The Commission is aware of the reactions by members of the Turkish government to an editorial comment in the Economist magazine. The Commission recalls in this context that the European Convention of Human Right stipulates that the right to freedom of expression includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority. As pointed out in judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, freedom of expression also entails that the authorities of a democratic State must tolerate criticism, even if they may regard it as provocative or insulting.
