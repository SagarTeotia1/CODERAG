limited resources and a fragile ecological system, the European Union should strive to become the most resource- and energy-efficient economic area in the world; points to the costs of inaction or delayed action in this respect and emphasises the huge economic potential for energy-efficient technologies and renewable energies on the world market, which Europe is best placed to exploit; 4. Believes that innovation plays a critically important role in Europe's ability to respond effectively to the challenges and opportunities of the global economy, as well as other major challenges, such as climate change; 5. Points out that implementing the Lisbon Strategy calls for the provision of sufficient and well targeted financial resources through the Community budget; regrets in this context the lack of financial resources earmarked to achieve the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy; ◙ Growth, employment and competitiveness Creating more employment and opportunities 6. Considers that labour market reform must aim to reconcile the demands of industry for greater flexibility with the demands of workers for more security, for example by creating new job prospects and new forms of security; is convinced that this combination of flexibility and social security makes it easier for employees, enterprises and SMEs to adapt to the challenges of a dynamic economy and changing society; calls therefore on the European Council and the Member States to define clear and objective principles and to introduce an intensified benchmarking exercise and exchanges of best practice with a view to developing and implementing flexicurity; 7.

Recalls that unemployment is most highly concentrated in vulnerable groups, especially that of less-qualified workers; a special effort is therefore needed to promote active policies of employment training for unemployed workers who may be less qualified, and to improve the educational system so as to reduce the high level of pupil failure; 9.

Deplores the fact that the proportion of women in the workforce still falls far short of the Lisbon objectives; believes that older workers should be able to remain in the workforce on a voluntary basis, supported by appropriate training and healthcare at work; early retirement has to be discouraged and workers should voluntarily be allowed to work past the legal retirement age if they and their employers
