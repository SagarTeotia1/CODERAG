WRITTEN QUESTION E-1751/05 by Christine De Veyrac (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (19 May 2005) Subject: Polish purchase of American aircraft Quite a commotion was caused by recent information about Poland preparing to purchase civil aircraft from the United States rather than from the European Airbus consortium. A similar situation occurred in December 2002 when Poland bought American F-16 fighter planes; they could just as well have chosen Swedish-British or French aircraft. At that time, Poland had just finalised negotiations for the accession to the European Union but was not yet a full-fledged Member State. Today, it is a Member State. Poland, like all the new States that became part of the European Union just over a year ago, has called for European solidarity. This call has been heeded and is something towards which we all contribute. It would at least seem legitimate to expect that such solidarity be a two way-exchange! Could the Commission confirm this news that Poland, a new Member State of the Union, is preparing to purchase civil aircraft from the United States rather than from the European Airbus consortium? If so, has the Commission made the necessary representations to the Polish authorities and warned them that such a decision would appear to be a serious lack of solidarity towards the European Union?
