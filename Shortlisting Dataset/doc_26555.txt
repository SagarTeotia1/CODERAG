Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (23 June 2011) The Commission is not aware of any official complaint concerning the products referred to by the Honourable Member. There is however Union legislation which protects consumers against unsubstantiated claims made by traders. Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices OJ L 149, 11.6.2005. (‘UCPD’) requires that traders operate in accordance with the requirements of professional diligence and that they do not distort the economic behaviour of consumers by inducing them to enter transactions they would not have entered otherwise. The directive prevents traders from engaging in misleading and aggressive commercial practices and, in particular, prohibits (in all circumstances) the practice of falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations (UCPD — Annex I n. 17). Furthermore, the Guidance on the implementation/application of the UCPD, issued in December 2009 Document EC(2009) 1666 accessible using the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/rights/docs/Guidance_UCP_Directive_en.pdf — see in particular Section 3.3 , states that traders must be able to substantiate any factual claims with scientific evidence. It also provides enough guidance on how the directive applies to such claims. It is the primary competence of national authorities and courts to investigate the practices of particular companies operating on their territories in the light of Union legislation. Consumers who have been misled should report their case to the relevant competent authorities, whose contact details can be found using the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/empowerment/cons_networks_en.htm
