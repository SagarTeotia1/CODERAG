WRITTEN QUESTION E-2055/06 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (12 May 2006) Subject: Possible infringement of Directives 97/62/EC, 92/43/EEC, 85/337/EEC and 80/68/EEC in Cabanes — Oropesa, Spain The government of the Autonomous Region of Valencia has for several years been promoting the construction of a road linking the villages of Cabanes and Oropesa. Its environmental impact was the subject of various appeals to the Commission (for example Written Question E‑2863/99). At the time it was feared that the project might infringe Directives 97/62/EC OJ L 305, 8.11.1997, p. 42 . , 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 . , 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 . and 80/68/EEC OJ L 20, 26.1.1980, p. 43 . and Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 OJ L 326, 21.11.1986, p. 2 . . The government of Valencia recently approved completion of the project along the first seven kilometres of the road, despite the controversy and serious environmental repercussions, which have been the subject of complaints for years. A new project is now being studied for the continuation of the road using the same route, which would, according to ecotoxicological research findings, have an irreversible impact on the Karstic system of the Miravet caves, which are the habitat of species of invertebrate unique in the world, in particular Typhalatya miravetensis and the recently discovered Arrhopalites miravetensis , as well as numerous species that have yet to be studied and classified. The Commission closed the file on the case, since it felt that the road project was compatible with the compulsory environmental impact declaration. However, it has emerged in the meantime that the environmental impact assessment was totally inadequate, since it made no mention of the fact that the road would go through the protection perimeter of the Desert de les Palmes nature reserve (and even go inside it), nor of the cave-dwelling species of fauna, which have still not been studied and constitute discoveries of great scientific importance. It would therefore seem necessary to reopen the case, since a large number of species have been discovered in the Karstic subsoil that require classification and have not been included in the environmental impact assessment for the continuation of the road. In view of all this, what measures will the Commission take to deal with the situation?
