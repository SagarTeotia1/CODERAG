Question for written answer E-6939/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (9 September 2010) Subject: Discrimination in the distribution of humanitarian aid in Pakistan According to the Catholic news agency Fides, there is a danger that discrimination is affecting the distribution of international aid sent to Pakistan to assist the victims of the devastating monsoon flooding. The agency has reported cases in which the Pakistani local authorities have used various means to prevent Christians and Hindus from obtaining essential items and humanitarian aid, particularly in areas where Islamic fundamentalism has a stray presence. Given that the EU is involved in sending humanitarian aid to the worst affected regions of Pakistan, is the Commission aware of the events reported by the Fides agency? Has it protested to the Pakistani authorities about these events? What will it do to encourage the central and local authorities in Pakistan to end the reported discrimination in the distribution of humanitarian aid? Lastly, does it think that behaviour of this kind constitutes a violation of human rights and, possibly, of the undertakings given to the EU by Pakistan under the cooperation agreement?
