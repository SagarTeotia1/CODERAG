Question for written answer E-006628/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Teixeira (PPE) (11 July 2011) Subject: Major NSRF projects accepted by the EU The NSRF establishes the framework for the EU's economic, social and territorial cohesion policy for the 2007‑13 period, addressing operations which, due to their financial dimension, will require detailed examination by the EU institutions. Support for these operations, under the heading ‘major projects’, is covered by the provisions laid down by Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, of 11 July 2006, with changes introduced by the entry into force of Council Regulation (EC) No 284/2009 of 7 April 2007 and Regulation (EU) No 539/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2010. According to the NSRF newsletter No 11, which contains information received up to March 2011, Portugal submitted 19 major projects to the Commission, calling for an overall investment of EUR 2 939 million, with EUR 1 099 million co‑financed by the ERDF and Cohesion Fund. The Commission has already approved 10 of these major projects, namely those presented by Swedwood Portugal in Paços de Ferreira, Celbi in Figeueira da Foz, CUF in Estarreja, Embraer in Evora, Sociedade Portuguesa de Ar Líquido in Estarreja, ERSUC-Resíduos Sólidos do Centro, S. A in Litoral Centro, CRIL-Buraca/Pontinha in Lisbon, the Pisão-Roxo connection to be built by EDIA, the new paediatric hospital in Coimbra and Eutelset in Madeira. Could the Commission say: — What stage of development and implementation has been reached so far by each of the 10 projects already approved by the EU? — When will a decision be reached concerning the nine projects still awaiting EU approval? What is the state of progress with regard to their assessment? — What can Portugal do to speed up the decision-making process for projects submitted to the EU in the future?
