ORAL QUESTION H-0061/03 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Camilo Nogueira Román to the Council Subject: Conflict between the Commission and the Council regarding policy and legislation relating to the transport by sea of petroleum and other hazardous products The Commission is planning to implement the Erika legislation on the basis of the original texts (which laid down stricter rules designed to make Community waters safe) and by tightening up what has already been adopted by Parliament and the Council. It has also heeded calls from the College of Commissioners for specific EU legislation similar to that drawn up by the USA in response to the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska. On the other hand the Council (as demonstrated by the agreements reached at the Council of Transport Ministers with the involvement of the Spanish Prime Minister, José María Aznar) has rejected such an approach, since it wishes EU legislation to continue to be determined by the IMO – a body which offers certain Member States with interests in the maritime sector a better base from which to protect the status quo, thereby allowing the oil companies and a ragbag of international transport groups and mafias to hold sway. Is the Council aware that the Member States and the Commission hold contradictory views which are delaying the implementation of strict, effective laws designed to bring safety to the seas – this being a matter which, on account of the Prestige disaster off the coast of Galicia, has become urgent in the extreme? What action is the Council going to take in order to resolve this political conflict?
