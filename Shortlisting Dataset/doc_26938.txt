ORAL QUESTION H-0175/08 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Sharon Bowles to the Commission Subject: Small boat fishermen Is the Commission aware of the establishment of the Small Boat Fishermen's Association in the UK following the fishing quotas imposed this year? Is the Commission aware that these new quotas for some areas of the UK has meant some small fleets can only catch one cod per boat each day? Although it is up to the UK Government to decide on the distribution of the fishing quotas amongst large and small boats, does the Commission recognise the local and traditional importance of small fleets, some of which have received sustainability awards? Does it believe more should be done in Europe to protect them? If so, how?
