Question for written answer E-001079/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Sir Graham Watson (ALDE) (7 February 2012) Subject: Hague Convention and the Brussels II Convention and grandparents The Hague Convention and the Brussels II Convention, under Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003, reinforce the right of the child to maintain contact with both parents by ensuring access rights for the former spouse which are recognised across national boundaries. Research by HSBC Bank suggests that 16 % of grandparents in their sixties provide financial support to their grandchildren, with 27 % of children aged 11 to 16 stating they can share things with their grandparents which they cannot talk about to their parents. Currently there is no right of contact for grandparents to contact their grandchildren under the Convention. Has the Commission considered drafting proposals to widen the current Convention?
