ORAL QUESTION H-0231/07 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Olle Schmidt to the Commission Subject: The Russo-German gas pipeline in the Baltic A debate has arisen in the media concerning the degree of detail in which the route of the Russo-German gas pipeline has already been decided. It has been claimed that European Parliament and Council Decision No 1364/2006/EC of 6 September 2006 fixed its route. Does the Commission consider that the route of the Russo-German gas pipeline has already been decided in detail in that decision? Furthermore, does the Commission consider that the pipeline absolutely has to follow an underwater route? Could it not just as well go overland, so that it can become a TEN-E project? 1 OJ L 262, 22.9.2006, p. 1.
