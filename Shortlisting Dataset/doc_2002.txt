Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (10 March 2011) Recognising the need to modernise the Package Travel Directive Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours, OJ L 158, 23.6.1990. in order to adapt it to the developments in the EU travel market, the Commission has started the preparation of an impact assessment for a revision of the directive. As regards more specifically the rights of consumers in case of disruptions of air service, it should be noted that the consumer protection rules of the directive apply also in force majeure situations. Consumers are therefore entitled to assistance from the tour organiser in situations like the closing of European airspace caused by the Icelandic ash cloud in 2010 or other similar situations mentioned by the Honourable Member. In addition, if the package holiday includes air transport, Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, OJ L 46, 17.2.2004. is also applicable. However, the consumer does normally not have the right to claim damages from the tour organiser or the airline in force majeure situations (but he remains entitled to care and assistance from the airline pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 261/2004).
