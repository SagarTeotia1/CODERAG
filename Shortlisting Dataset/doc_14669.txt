Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (20 July 2011) In line with Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care falls under the responsibility of Member States. For this reason, the Commission does not have comprehensive data on the use of electroconvulsive therapy as a psychiatric treatment. No research projects investigating the cerebral effects of electroconvulsive therapy have been supported to date by the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (2007‑13).
