9999/C Q999 E/009 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1418/04 by Nirj Deva (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 April 2004) Subject: Good governance, democracy and the rule of law as pre-conditions for aid effectiveness and sustainable development Given that the concepts of good governance, democracy and the rule of law are pre-conditions for aid effectiveness and sustainable development in developing countries, I would like to ask the Commission how far it makes these concepts pre-conditions for its development aid? What is the Commission's strategy to avoid EU aid money being wasted in highly corrupt and undemocratic countries with poor resource management capacities and non-transparent implementation mechanisms? Does the Commission view the above-mentioned conditionality on the one hand, and the developing countries' right of ownership of their development process on the other, as being in any way incompatible?
