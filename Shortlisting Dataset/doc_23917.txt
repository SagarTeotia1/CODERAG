ORAL QUESTION H-1020/06 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Proinsias De Rossa to the Commission Subject: Bullying and harassment at work In response to Oral Question O-0076/03 , on 14 January 2004 the Commission rejected my colleague Stephen Hughes' claim that nothing was being done by the Commission to protect workers from bullying and harassment at the workplace, saying 'We have put the matter on the agenda for 2004'. Will the Commission now comment on recent research by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, which records that 5% of EU workers have experienced violence at work – while as many as 10% of workers in the Netherlands, 9% of workers in France and the UK, and 8% of workers in Ireland report such abuse? Can the Commission now state when and how it intends to progress this matter and offer workers real protection from abuse?
