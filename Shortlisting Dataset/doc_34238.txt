Question for written answer P-003007/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niccolò Rinaldi (ALDE) (24 March 2011) Subject: Safety at nuclear power stations The recent nuclear disaster in Japan has increased the anxiety of the European public over the safety of nuclear power stations in a number of Member States. The dense concentration of nuclear plants in some Member States, including countries bordering on Italy, control policies which do not always offer the necessary guarantees regarding suspected breaches of the safety rules by managers, and the need for a detailed evaluation of the existing protection systems and their effectiveness, especially in the face of potential violations of the safety criteria, are all factors which point up the need, as a matter of extreme urgency, to verify whether Europe's nuclear power stations as a whole are operating according to the rules and whether all the safety procedures are being respected, pursuant to Article 4 of Council Directive 2009/71/Euratom of 25 June 2009 establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations. In view of the IAEA's Nuclear Safety Review for the Year 2009, which refers (p. 2) to possible disasters in the area of civilian nuclear power, can the Commission state: 1. how it intends to verify the security certification of the EU's nuclear reactors; 2. how it will ensure that the checks take the form of a rigorous, honest and transparent evaluation; 3. whether it considers stress tests, if proposed, to be sufficient?
