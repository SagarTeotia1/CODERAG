Question for written answer E-008782/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (4 October 2011) Subject: Paediatric neurology network The Italian Ministry of Health has earmarked more than EUR 1.5 million for the establishment of a network to collect information, brain images and data relating to children suffering from rare neurological disorders. Unfortunately, very little is known about these disorders, which can be disabling for sufferers. 50 % of rare disorders affect the central nervous system. Many of them are degenerative, poorly understood and highly complex; the scope for both diagnosis and treatment is very limited. The families of children affected by rare neurological disorders are often powerless. Accordingly, it is essential to bring together — via a network — any information or indications that might help to yield specific diagnoses. This virtual documentation centre for paediatric neurological disorders will be developed using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging equipment. The various hospitals involved will be linked via a broadband system. Given that research on paediatric neurological disorders is not yet able to generate effective treatment for such disorders, can the Commission say whether it intends to expand the innovative Italian network described above to the EU as a whole, so as to join forces in fighting the spread of such brain conditions?
