Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (28 November 2011) Sugar prices have increased rather significantly on the world markets in 2010-2011 and to a lesser degree on the EU market due to a tighter supply situation. In the course of the 2010/2011 marketing year the Commission has taken a series of exceptional measures in order to ease the sugar supply on the EU markets. As a result of these measures (release of out-of-quota sugar on the internal market, open duty free tariff quotas and open a tender for additional imports at reduced duty) the overall sugar supply increased by 1.35 million tonnes. As a consequence, with the exception of short-lived local supply problems, the shortage of sugar on the EU market was contained. Concerning the question of sugar for bee food it should be noted that the annex of Commission Regulation (EC) 967/2006 OJ L 176, 30.6.2006. lists the eligible products for the use of industrial sugar (or out-of-quota sugar). The list, which was drawn up by the Commission on the basis of Article 62(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 1234/2007 OJ L 299, 16.11.2007. includes in particular bio-ethanol, alcohol, other products of the chemical or the pharmaceutical industry, etc. The Council did not foresee the use of industrial sugar for bee food or other animal feed. It should be also added that undertakings which intend to use industrial sugar for the manufacture of the eligible products have to respect a series of administrative obligations which could risk to be far too burdensome for small scale food producers such as beekeepers (see Articles 5-13 of Commission Regulation (EC) 967/2006). Until now the Commission has not received any request from beekeepers to use industrial sugar for bee food.
