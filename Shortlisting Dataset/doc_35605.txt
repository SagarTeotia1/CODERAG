Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2012) The VAT relief for low value commercial consignments is provided for in Article 23 of Council Directive 2009/132/EC Council Directive 2009/132/EC of 19 October 2009 determining the scope of Article 143(b) and (c) of Directive 2006/112/EC as regards exemption from value added tax on the final importation of certain goods, OJ L 292, 10.11.2009 . which requires Member States to grant an exemption for imported goods of a total value not exceeding EUR 10 (a threshold which Member States may raise up to EUR 22). Member States may also exclude from the exemption goods imported by mail order. The Commission does not intend to propose any increase of the mentioned threshold. The reason is that raising this threshold would increase the distortion of competition with equivalent products traded within the EU which are subject to VAT. The Commission is aware of cases under the current rules where such distortions exist. The current rules do however provide certain options for Member States to prevent such situations. However, the Commission services are currently examining how to simplify the customs and fiscal treatment at the importation of low value consignments.
