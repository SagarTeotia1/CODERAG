Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2008) Existing EU anti-discrimination and equal treatment legislation does not include provisions prohibiting multiple discrimination. However, Recital 14 of Council Directive 2000/43/EC Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, OJ L 180, 19.7.2000. provides that the Community should aim to promote equality between men and women, especially since women are often the victims of multiple discrimination. The same wording is to be found in Recital (3) of Council Directive 2000/78 Council Directive 2000/78 of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000. . Some Member States, including Germany, Spain and Austria, have specifically dealt with this issue in their national legislation. The Commission is not aware of similar provisions in Greek legislation. In the context of the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the Commission launched a study on tackling multiple discrimination — practices, policies and laws http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/fundamental_rights/public/pubst_en.htm#stud to analyse the causes and consequences of multiple discrimination and to identify concrete recommendations in this area. The study included roundtable meetings with ministries, equality bodies and non-government organisations (NGOs) in ten Member States, including Greece. A dissemination conference took place on 6‑7 December 2007 in Denmark. The Commission recalls that Greece has transposed Directive 2004/43/EC through Act 3304/05 on Equal Treatment (27 January 2005). The Commission considers that most of the relevant provisions have now been transposed into Greek law. The Commission underlines that the deadline for transposing Directive 2006/54/EC Directive 2006/54/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation (recast), OJ L 204, 26.7.2006. at national level is 15 August 2008 and that it will start examining the implementation of this directive by Greece after this date. Finally, the Commission intends to propose a Directive in the course of 2008 in order to extend the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation to areas outside the sphere of employment and occupation.
