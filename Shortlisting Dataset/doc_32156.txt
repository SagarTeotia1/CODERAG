countries 43. Underlines that CEAS should be fully coherent with the objectives and activities in the area of refugee protection of EU instruments for cooperation with developing countries (such as the European Development Fund, the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights) and agreements and partnerships between the EU and developing countries (such as the Cotonou Agreement and the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership); 44. Shares the Commission’s view that asylum is an integral part of development cooperation with third countries rather than a crisis management tool; reiterates also that development cooperation, particularly crisis prevention, human rights monitoring, conflict transformation and peace-building, could serve as a preventive instrument of displacement; stresses therefore that CEAS should be closely connected with European development and humanitarian policies; 45. Looks forward to the assessment of the Regional Protection Programmes due to take place in 2009; underlines that the development of such programmes should be fully coherent with National and Regional Action Plans, the Thematic Programme on Migration and Asylum of the DCI and, more generally, should never be a means to remove responsibilities from Member States and the EU; calls on the Commission to improve coordination of the measures taken by its various services in this context with a view to optimising synergies between them, and to report to Parliament on steps taken in this connection; 46. Recognises the importance of strengthening the reception capacities of first-asylum countries and of setting up, at European level and in close cooperation with the Office of the United Nations' High-Commissioner for Refugees, a resettlement programme laying down common criteria and coordination mechanisms; 47. Also requests that an evaluation should be given of the adequacy of the funds available for measure relating to third countries, for example – protection within the region - especially in light of Parliament’s stated view that these measures require additional funding and not a reallocation of development funds; 48. Calls on the Commission to promote greater participation by Member States in worldwide refugee resettlement efforts; 49. Notes with great interest the idea of setting up 'Protected Entry Procedures' and strongly encourages the Commission to give due consideration to the specific procedures for and the practical implications of such measures; 50. Looks forward with interest to the results of the study on the joint processing of asylum applications outside EU territory which the Commission plans to conduct in 2009, and warns against any temptation to transfer responsibility for welcoming asylum seekers and processing their requests to third countries or the Office of the United Nations High-Commissioner for Refugees; * * * 51. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Member States, Frontex and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 21.1.2009 OPINION of the Committee on Development for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the future of the European Common Asylum System ( 2008/2305(INI) ) Rapporteur: Danutė Budreikaitė SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Development calls on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, as the
