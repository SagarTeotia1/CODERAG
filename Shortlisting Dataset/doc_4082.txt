Question for written answer E-010213/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (9 December 2010) Subject: Western Sahara On 10 October 2010 more than 20 000 people in Tanezruft Tutrimt (Western Sahara) launched a peaceful protest in order to demand their rights, in particular the right to exploit natural mineral resources and the right to work. The army suppressed the demonstration under orders from the Moroccan Government, killing 28 people and injuring 723. One-hundred-and-fifty-nine people are reportedly missing, and an unspecified number were arrested. The occupying forces then incited armed settlers in the capital city, El Aaiún, to carry out raids. Finally the army declared martial law in the occupied territories. The Saharan people have been demanding their independence since the 1930s, but when Spanish domination came to an end in 1976 the Kingdom of Morocco opposed the country’s independence. Morocco’s interest in its large oil and gas reserves has led to incessant guerilla warfare, to which the application of the UN resolution providing for a referendum on the country’s permanent status was supposed to put a stop in 1992. No such referendum has been held to date, and the guerilla warfare — which has now become outright civil war — has taken on a new dimension with the suppression of demonstrations by an oppressed people asking for more freedom. 1. Is the Commission aware of the serious incident on 10 October 2010 and of Morocco’s extremely serious violations of the rights of the Saharan people? 2. How does it intend to address the situation resulting from the suppression of the demonstration of 10 October 2010? 3. How does it intend to address the need for the international community to take action to ensure prompt application of the UN resolutions on Western Sahara, and more generally to ensure the application of fundamental rights in this area, including the right to self-determination?
