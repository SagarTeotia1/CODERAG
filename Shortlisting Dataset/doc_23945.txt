Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (6 April 2006) The competence of the European Union does not extend to the regulation of taxis and the use of bus lanes. This is an area where Member States and regional and local authorities are in the best position to take decisions in the light of local, regional and national requirements. Public transport and taxis can make an important contribution to solving transport problems in cities. As explained in the Transport White Paper COM(2001)370 final. , the Commission works hard to promote and disseminate good practice on cleaner and more efficient urban transport through, for example, the Civitas initiative www.europa.eu.int/civitas-initiative.net/main.phtml?lan=en and the Intelligent Energy Europe programme Decision No 1230/2003/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 adopting a multi-annual programme for action in the field of energy: ‘Intelligent Energy — Europe’ (2003‑06), OJ L 176, 15.7.2003. . The Commission seeks to raise awareness about clean and efficient urban transport measures across Europe. However, under the principle of subsidiarity, Member States and regional and local authorities can take their own decisions on the specific measures they will put in place.
