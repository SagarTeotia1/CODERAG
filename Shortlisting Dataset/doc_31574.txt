WRITTEN QUESTION E-3217/10 by Tadeusz Cymański (ECR) to the Commission (7 May 2010) Subject: Alternatives to animal testing The Commission's proposal for a directive COM(2008)0543 states that Member States should minimise the use of animals in scientific research, employing alternative methods where available. However, during the debates which Parliament held in its previous term, it became apparent that some of these alternative methods raised serious doubts and opposition. This was evident in the amendment to Article 4(1) of the proposal for a directive. Furthermore, a trialogue between the Council, Parliament and the Commission upheld the right of Member States to take sovereign decisions on the application of methods using human embryonic and foetal stem cells as an alternative to conducting experiments on animals. In view of the doubts and opposition raised, in particular, by the use of human embryonic and foetal stem cells, does the Commission consider that such research ought to be financed from the EU budget if such methods are not permitted in all Member States? Does it currently take part in financing research using human embryonic and foetal stem cells under the 6th and 7th Framework Programmes? If so, what are the names of these research programmes, how long will they last and how much funding do they receive from the EU? Is such funding comprehensive, i.e., does it cover the creation of human embryos destined to be deliberately killed during scientific research, or does it only fund research carried out on pre-existing embryos?
