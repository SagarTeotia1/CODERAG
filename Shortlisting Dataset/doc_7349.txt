Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (6 June 2011) The Commission is currently working on a new legislative proposal revising the directives on energy end-uses and energy services (2006/32/EC Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC, OJ L 114, 27.4.2006. ) and on combined heat and power (2004/8/EC Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market and amending Directive 92/42/EEC, OJ L 52, 21.2.2004. ). In such legal proposal foreseen for adoption within the coming months the Commission intends to set out a range of binding energy efficiency measures. The scope of the likely measures was announced in the communication on a new Energy Efficiency Plan COM(2011)109 final. , which the Commission put forward in March 2011. In addition to the binding measures, Member States have been requested to set indicative energy efficiency targets for 2020 in line with their headline targets defined in the framework of the Europe 2020 process and their national reform programmes. In a second step, the Commission will assess the progress made by Member States towards achieving the 20 % energy saving target for 2020. If this review shows that this overall EU target is unlikely to be achieved, then the Commission intends to propose mandatory national targets for 2020, taking into account the individual starting points of Member States, their economic performance and early action undertaken in the field. It is the Commission's view that cohesion policy should continue to concentrate its intervention on the development of Europe's less developed regions. It has proposed in the budget review that cohesion policy should be closely aligned with Europe 2020 and the headline targets. Significant resources should therefore be available to achieve energy efficiency targets in the next programming period.
