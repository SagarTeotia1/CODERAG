Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (25 November 2005) The question refers to three distinct issues: the use of netting for hunting, the sale of netting, and the use of netting for crop protection: 1. The use of Japanese nets to hunt is prohibited according to both the Birds Directive Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds. , and according to local legislation. Decree 71/2004 of 9 July, of the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands, lists the species subject to hunting and inland water fishing and establishes the regulations for their protection. This decree prohibits the use of fine nets, including land nets, Japanese or vertical nets and gun nets, for the capture of animals. 2. The sale of netting is not prohibited under Community law. The Birds Directive, and in particular Article 8, regulates the use of all means, arrangements or methods used for the large-scale or non-selective capture of killing of birds or capable of causing the local disappearance of species. But it does not regulate the sale of these means. 3. While the Birds Directive prohibits generally the use of nets for bird hunting and capture, their use can be exceptionally authorised by making use of the derogations provided in Article 9 of the directive. Preventing serious damage to crops is one of the reasons for derogation foreseen under this article and it is upon this basis that the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands has exercised its option to apply a derogation to use vertical nets for crop protection.
