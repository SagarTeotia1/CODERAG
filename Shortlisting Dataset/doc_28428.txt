ANNEX I Joint Declaration of the Budgetary Authority on Amending Budget 4/2004 In adopting the amending budget 4/2004 on the revised establishment plans, the European Parliament and Council have approved the following declaration: "The recruitment of staff is regulated by the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations. Accordingly, all institutions will apply the following rules in 2004: · All officials recruited before the 1st of May 2004 will be classified in accordance with Article 2 of Annex XIII to the new Staff Regulations. · All officials recruited after the 1st of May 2004 will be classified in accordance with the new Staff Regulations, in particular Articles 5, 12 and 13 of Annex XIII, whether they are recruited to new posts or to vacant posts. During the preparation of the first reading of the 2005 budget and in time for decisions to be agreed at the Budget conciliation in July, each institution, office or agency will be required to report to the Budgetary Authority on the implementation of the revised staff grade structure and the effects on their establishment plan. If needed in respect of 2004, each institution, office or agency will propose an adjustment of its establishment plan in so far as the actual occupancy of posts diverges from the conversion of the establishment plan as approved in April 2004. Such proposals will take into consideration the requirements mentioned above and the need for vacant posts at every grade in the establishment plan for normal recruitment and promotion purposes in accordance with the Staff Regulations."
