Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (25 August 2006) The Commission has received a request for an expiry review of these measures from the Community industry which contains evidence that the expiry of measures would be likely to lead to a continuation and/or recurrence of injurious dumping of Chinese imports. The request has been processed by the Commission and the additional background information provided by the Honourable Member was in this respect very welcome. The Commission's final decision in this case to open an expiry review was reflected in a notice of initiation published in the Official Journal on 19 July 2006 (OJ C 167 p. 13). The Honourable Member may rest assured that the Commission has acted in full conformity with the requirements of the law. The expiry review investigation will now assess whether the measures should be extended for another period of five years. During this investigation, the existing measures will still apply.
