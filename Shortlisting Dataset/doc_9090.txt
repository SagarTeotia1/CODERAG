Question for written answer E-8786/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Franz Obermayr (NI) (26 October 2010) Subject: Use of Austrian funds for EU genetic engineering projects Austria calls itself ‘GM free’, which is not quite true, since half a million tonnes of GM soya are imported to Austria every year as cattle fodder. Austria is, of course, a member of the EU, and so part of Austria's net contribution flows into the EU's agricultural funds and a portion thereof is necessarily spent on GM research. Companies like Bayer receive substantial aid for projects which by any reckoning count as GM agricultural projects. Aid for ecological agriculture, on the other hand, receives only a fraction of such funds. Now, according to the Commission's plans, further resources from the EU's agricultural spending are to be redirected towards unspecified research. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Does it know what purposes Austria's contribution to the EU's agricultural budget is being used for? 2. Are these monies also used to finance GM agricultural projects? 3. Is it possible to rule out the possibility that such projects are not being financed with Austrian resources? 4. Which areas of research are to receive the funds redirected from agricultural aid? 5. Is agro-genetic technology, i.e. research into GM agriculture, one of the areas benefiting from this redistribution of funds?
