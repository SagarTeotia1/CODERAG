ORAL QUESTION H-0854/05 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Karatzaferis to the Commission Subject: Unfair treatment of supply teachers in Greece Greece has a system of supply teachers who provide cover where required in secondary education. They have graduated from Greek institutions of higher education (as is the case with their colleagues who have permanent posts), perform exactly the same duties as those colleagues and the overwhelming majority of them are sent to teach in remote areas of Greece. Despite their situation, they are unjustly rewarded as they are not paid during the summer months when the schools are closed, nor do they receive additional pay at Christmas or Easter (which all their colleagues with permanent posts do), while they exist in a particularly soul-destroying state of uncertainty because they are never sure if they will be called upon to work. Are the above arrangements consistent with the principle of equal pay for equal work? How can the Commission intervene to put an end to this peculiar form of discrimination against secondary school supply teachers?
