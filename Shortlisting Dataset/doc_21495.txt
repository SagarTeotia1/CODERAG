WRITTEN QUESTION P-3024/07 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Council (8 June 2007) Subject: Tourism in the Palestinian territories Leaving aside the rationale behind the European Union's refusal for political reasons to recognise the Palestinian National Unity Government, all the institutions will surely agree that the situation in the Palestinian territories is far from ideal. For example, earnings from tourism have now fallen to 1 % of GDP from 7 % in 2000. In addition, the amount of time spent by tourists in the Palestinian territories has also diminished and is now only two or three hours, which means that 98 % of earnings from tourism go to Israel. In a recent interview with the Greek press, the Tourism Minister Khuloud Daibes referred to her government's desire for an end to the travel warnings being issued by many countries which consider Palestine to be a dangerous place to visit. Has the Council discussed with Israel within the Quartet the possibility of facilitating tourist trips to the Palestinian territories? What is the current situation at EU level regarding warnings being issued to those intending to travel to the Palestinian territories?
