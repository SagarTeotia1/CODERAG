WRITTEN QUESTION E-2290/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (28 June 2005) Subject: Drowning of a child in a public swimming pool in Greece The recent death of a 13-year-old in the Chalandrion public swimming pool (in June 2005) in Athens has caused justifiable concern amongst thousands of Greek parents whose children train at swimming pools every day. The Chalandrion municipal authority maintains that the accident occurred because of the failure of the inexperienced lifeguard on duty at the time to take prompt action. Does the Commission know whether Greek (private and public) swimming pools of every kind are manned with experienced lifeguards in sufficient numbers? Is there a statutory requirement regarding the minimum number of lifeguards manning a swimming pool at any given time? Are there any provisions regarding the minimum qualifications and experience required of lifeguards which must be verified by the municipality or individuals employing them?
