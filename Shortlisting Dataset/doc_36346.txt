ORAL QUESTION H-0718/08 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Giovanna Corda to the Commission Subject: Non-implementation of the Regulation on the rights of airline passengers Despite several recent Commission initiatives, particularly the information document responding to specific questions on the application of the most controversial provisions of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on the rights of airline passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, airlines are still getting round the Regulation, randomly citing ‘ force majeure’ or ‘exceptional circumstances’ to avoid taking account of the legitimate claims of aggrieved passengers. Since dialogue with and self-regulation of airlines has failed, does the Commission finally intend to adopt major sanctions or change the Regulation to protect and compensate European citizens whose rights have been infringed? OJ L 46, 17.2.2004, p.1
