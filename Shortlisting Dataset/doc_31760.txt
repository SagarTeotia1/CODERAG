In the light of this growing parliamentary, governmental and civil society agreement regarding the potential benefits of international taxes such as the Tobin tax, will the Council outline its own views on the issue? In particular, will the Council respond to President Chirac's proposals on international taxation made in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year? Does the Council intend to support the legislative initiatives in France and Belgium to issue a Tobin tax once such a tax is established in all EU Member States, by calling on all European Member States to approve similar national legislation? Does the Council see a role for such a tax as a means for generating revenue for socially valuable investment in environment, education and development across the globe, and as an important contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals? Does it see a role for such a tax in diminishing speculation on value exchanges and in stabilising financial markets? Will the Council therefore take concrete action in this regard?
