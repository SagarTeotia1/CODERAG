are those covering social dialogue (040302; 04030301; 04030302; and 04030303), mobility (040305 and 040304), the agencies (Bilbao; Dublin; Cedefop; and Turin), and studies on the social situation and demographic change (040307); 5. Believes that, concerning the budget lines on administrative expenditure and the budget lines on the agencies, any changes should be agreed between all the committees concerned, and expects the Committee on Budgets to avoid any horizontal actions, such as cutting, increasing, or putting in reserve certain budget lines, which undermine particular committees' competences and policy coherence; The 0402 budget lines - the European Social Fund (ESF) 6. Believes that the ESF and, in particular, all activities financed through the ESF to support vocational training and to increase the qualification of the EU citizens, has the potential of being a good catalyst for meeting certain Lisbon targets; 7. Welcomes every effort to render the activities of the ESF and the Structural Funds more transparent, in order to avoid any abuse or overlap with other funds, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGAF); 8. Agrees with the amount foreseen in the Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) for the payment appropriations as long as it represents a realistic view of the economic and social problems of the Member States, naturally also in relation to their absorption capacity; The 0403 budget lines Working in Europe : social dialogue and mobility 9. Welcomes the increase in the budget lines covering the social dialogue activities, which will enable the social partners, and in particular those from the new Member States, to participate closely in the initiatives taken by the Commission; 10.

Welcomes the fact that, following the IIA, the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS) is to receive further EUR 100 million for the duration of the Financial Framework; notes that the budgetary procedure was initiated in the Annual Policy Strategy (APS) and the PDB proposal before the adoption of the Interinstitutional Agreement; points out that therefore this increase is not reflected in the PDB; 12. Notes that financial allocation for the section gender equality within PROGRESS is less than in 2006 and that it represents 9.17 % of the global envelope rather than 12 %, as agreed between the institutions; The agencies 13. Endorses the PDB proposal as regards the four agencies within competence of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND), the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), and the European Training Foundation (ETF) – in order to allow them
