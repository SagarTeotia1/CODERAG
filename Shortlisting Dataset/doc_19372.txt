Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (10 July 2009) The Commission refers the Honourable Member to its reply to Written Question E‑0741/09 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp by Ms Muscardini. In addition, the Commission notes that irregular migration from Africa reaches Italy mostly trough vessels departing from Libyan shores and a minor share of them is also coming from Algeria These two countries can, therefore, give a key contribution to stemming irregular migration reaching Italy from Africa. The information relating to Libya has been provided in the aforementioned reply to Written Question E‑0741/09 . Concerning Algeria, the Commission offered technical and financial assistance, aimed at exerting a better surveillance along its borders and at enhancing the capacity to prevent and manage irregular migration. Furthermore, the Commission proposed to Algeria, to open negotiations for a readmission agreement including also provisions concerning third‑country nationals apprehended as irregular migrants. The Commission also focuses on the causes of the irregular migrations flows and considers of a key importance to better cooperate with and to mobilise the efforts of other transit and origin countries of migration in Africa. The Commission intends to address this issue through the development of the global approach to migration, including: — elaborating a long-term strategy for migration management, which takes into account the situation and needs of both the countries of destination and origin with regard to labour migration, — deepening dialogue with African partners, in particular in the framework of the Rabat process and the EU‑Africa Partnership on Migration, Mobility and Employment in order to identify and implement a common response to the challenges and opportunities created by migration; — mobilising additional resources and intensifying cooperation with countries of origin and transit, to reinforce their capacity to dismantle networks of traffickers in human beings and smugglers as well as to treat migrants with respect for their dignity and their rights; — developing measures allowing a better management and organisation of arrivals to the territory of Member States of people legitimately asking for asylum, as well as integrating capacity development on refugee protection in the cooperation with third countries.
