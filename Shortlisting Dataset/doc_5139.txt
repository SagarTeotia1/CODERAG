WRITTEN QUESTION E-4395/05 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (25 November 2005) Subject: Inhumane treatment of sub-Saharan immigrants in Morocco Reports from Medicines sans Frontières indicate that approximately 1000 sub-Saharan Africans, including pregnant women and children, have been abandoned on the edge of the Sahara desert, in the area of Bou-Izakarn, 30 km north from Goulimine. They have been abandoned by the Moroccan police without food or water, and while some of them are in need of urgent medical attention. The Moroccan Foreign Minister, Mohammed Benaissa, claims that the allegations are ‘propaganda’ and is denying the international community access to investigate the allegations or to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need in the region. Is the Commission satisfied with Mr Benaissa's declarations, or does it deem it necessary to demand greater transparency from the Moroccan Government so that the international community may see for itself the fate of the 1000 people whose destination remains unknown?
