of the priority area coordinators for EU Strategy for Danube Region made by the European Commission on the 3rd of February 2011; considers that from now on the countries and the regions leading priority areas of work should drive implementation of the Strategy by agreeing a work programme, identifying sources of finance, strengthening the cooperation between countries and regions in that particular area and launch the most immediate actions to help the Danube region to fully exploit its economic potential and, especially, to respect the deadline for the implementation of the flagship projects in that particular area; 34. Calls on the European Commission, in the context of the need to carry out an interim analysis of the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, to prepare concrete instruments and criteria for evaluating projects based on indicators that allow comparisons to be made; 35. Draws attention to the fact that the EU Strategy for the Danube Region should be seen as a process in which the principle of action and cooperation is constantly developed, making it necessary to update the strategy, and that the overriding goal is to find optimal mechanisms that can be transferred to future macro-regional strategies; supports the Commission’s plan to create a best practices database with a view to using these practices to develop future macro-regional strategies; 36. Calls on the European Commission to analyse the first results and experiences in connection with the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, which, together with the EU Baltic Sea Strategy, will help to map out possible sources and methods for financing macro-regional strategies and help in using the example of the Strategy as a pilot project for other macro-regional strategies to demonstrate their functionality; stresses however that the development of macro-regions is essentially of a complementary nature, coordinating existing priorities and funding resources; 37. Underlines that, linked by the Main-Danube canal, the Rhine and the Danube are directly connecting eleven countries from the North Sea to the Black Sea over a length of 3500km and emphasises the need to extend the EU Strategy for the Danube Region towards the Black Sea region; points out that the sustainable development of the Danube region will further enhance the geostrategic importance of the Black Sea region; 38. Draws attention, for the benefit of possible future macro-regional strategies, to the need for the European Commission to be able to anticipate such strategies on the basis of the territorial specificities of the regions concerned, providing the participating Member States with fresh ideas concerning topics of European interest and supporting them in drawing up a strategy; 39. Calls on the Commission to regularly inform and consult the European Parliament on the status of implementation and update of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region; 40. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and the other relevant institutions.
