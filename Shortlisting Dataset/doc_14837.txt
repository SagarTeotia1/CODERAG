Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2011) The Commission would like to refer to the response given to the Honourable Member referring to Question E‑009304/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB in which mention was made of the EU Anti-Corruption Report and the aim of this new mechanism to strengthen the implementation of strong anti-corruption policies in the EU Member States. As for the anti-corruption efforts in third countries, the Commission communication on fighting corruption in the EU pledged for a stronger focus on corruption in EU external policies, including enlargement, neighbourhood, as well as cooperation and development policies. The Commission participates in the G20 anti-corruption working group, promoting full commitment of the G20 members to implementing the anti-corruption action plan adopted in Seoul in 2010. The Commission is also fully supportive of a strong review mechanism of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and attaches great importance in this context to the principles of transparency, openness and inclusivity that may further help the States parties intensify the efforts against corruption.
