Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (16 October 2007) The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive Directive 2002/91/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings, OJ L 1, 4.1.2003. requires national regulations to lay down minimum energy performance requirements for buildings in general. The directive leaves it up to Member States to specify these requirements tailored to local (climate) conditions. In its Energy Efficiency Action Plan COM(2006)545 final. tabled in October 2006, the Commission announced its plans to elaborate a deployment strategy for very low energy or passive houses with a view to moving towards this type of housing as a benchmark in new construction in the medium term. Moreover, the Commission promotes the idea of low energy/low emission buildings by several promotion projects, such as ‘EcoBuildings’, ‘Concerto’ and ‘Promotion of European Passive Houses (www.europeanpassivehouses.org)’. Furthermore, the Commission provides Member States with the basis for the harmonised energy performance requirements sought by the Honorable Member, by initiating and financing a package of 31 CEN CEN = European Committee for Standardisation. standards on the holistic energy performance of buildings. On the financial side, the Commission encourages the use of Structural Funds and Funds of the European banks, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), for the refurbishment of existing buildings towards low energy buildings whenever feasible. Finally, voluntary initiatives of stakeholders and companies on the promotion and dissemination of low energy or passive houses are possible, and are welcomed by the Commission.
