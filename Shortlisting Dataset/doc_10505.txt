12 June 2001 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION pursuant to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure by Salvador Garriga Polledo on European non-profit making associations Motion for a European Parliament resolution on European non-profit making associations The European Parliament, A. whereas legal systems need to be put in place so that European Union citizens from any Member State can form associations to attain non-profit making objectives, B. whereas the lack of such a structure means that the possibilities for cooperation in this area among citizens from different EU Member States are extremely limited, C. whereas the objectives enshrined in the Treaties establishing the European Union could be more easily achieved through the participation of citizens working together with those of any Member State, D. whereas it is therefore vital for Community citizens to be provided with a legal instrument enabling them to form associations with other citizens from any other Member State and seek to attain shared objectives through a joint effort, 1. Calls for a statute for the European non-profit making association to be adopted within the European Union framework; 2. Calls for that statute to provide a structure for joint action on the part of Community citizens for the common good; 3. Recommends that the above statute should contain a register of European non-profit making associations so that Community citizens can join them.
