through active sustainable forest management. It should be kept in mind also that the timber industry already plays an important role as a provider of renewable energy from wood biomass. The communication COM(2008)645 final. Addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. on addressing deforestation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss recognises the need to address the drivers of deforestation. The Commission will monitor potential impacts of timber imports in this context. The Commission is also currently working on how to use resources efficiently and is finalising a flagship initiative on ‘Resource Efficient Europe’. These will help ensure that our biomass resources are used in an efficient and sustainable way for both energy and materials. 5. As regards the Renewable Energy Directive, the Commission remains of the view that the promotion of energy use from renewable energy sources plays a key role in its efforts to tackle climate change, secure EU energy supply, and promote innovation. These challenges are of great importance for the EU as highlighted in the Europe 2020 Strategy. Following recommendations adopted in February 2010 COM(2010)11 final , the Commission is to adopt a report by 31 December 2011, on whether additional measures regarding the sustainability requirements for the use of solid and gaseous biomass in electricity, heating and cooling would be appropriate. The Commission is to launch a public consultation on this issue in early 2011.
