WRITTEN QUESTION E-4726/08 by Ignasi Guardans Cambó (ALDE) to the Commission (8 September 2008) Subject: Conformity checks in Spain on products imported from third countries 15 March 2008 saw the entry into force in Spain of Royal Decree 330/2008 adopting control measures on imports of certain products (measures relating to the rules applicable to product safety). Pursuant to that Royal Decree the Foreign-Trade Inspection Service is required to examine imports of certain products such as footwear, textiles and household linen, toys, etc. In view of the fact that such border checks are not current in other EU countries or are carried out less strictly (which means that extra-Community trade could be distorted and adversely affected), does the Commission consider the Royal Decree to be compatible with Community Law and, in particular, with Council Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 OJ L 40, 17.2.1993, p. 1 . on checks for conformity with the rules on product safety in the case of products imported from third countries? Does the Commission consider the above measure to be in accordance with the World Trade Organisation's rules and principles? Where appropriate, what action is the Commission planning to take in order to prevent the introduction of practices of this kind which may distort extra-Community trade?
