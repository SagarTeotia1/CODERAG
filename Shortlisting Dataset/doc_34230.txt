Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (19 December 2007) The overarching goal of the Commission’s and the Member States’ policy is to contribute to a peaceful transition towards a civilian, legitimate government. The liberation of political prisoners is hence of prime importance to the process of an inclusive dialogue. The Commission continues to use all appropriate channels to push for the unconditional liberation of all political detainees, both bilaterally in meetings with Burma/Myanmar and with regional powers, and in the framework of multilateral meetings in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asian-Europe Meeting (ASEM) context. Most recently, the Commission has pressed for this objective in the EU‑ASEAN Summit, the EU‑China Summit and the EU‑India Summit. The Commission will keep the spotlight on the issue.
