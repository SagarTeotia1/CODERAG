Question for written answer E-008950/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Elżbieta Katarzyna Łukacijewska (PPE) (7 October 2011) Subject: National plans to fight Alzheimer's disease World Alzheimer's Day was celebrated recently. The disease, which mainly affects the over-60s, is one of the most frequent causes of disability among the elderly. In addition, as Europe's population ages, the number of people with brain diseases and other neurodegenerative diseases is set to increase substantially in the coming years. The question of Alzheimer's and an ageing population has been the subject of renewed debate in the context of the actions and sectoral priorities pursued by Ministers for Health under recent Union Presidencies, particularly the French Presidency in 2008 and the Hungarian and Polish Presidencies in 2011. To date, however, few Member States have adopted plans to combat this problem. 1. What does the Commission think of the measures so far taken by the Member States to draw up and implement national plans to combat brain diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular Alzheimer's? 2. How many Member States have introduced or are drawing up such plans? 3. Will the Commission publish a report in the near future detailing the most effective solutions identified by the Member States, with a view to encouraging other countries to adopt such plans?
