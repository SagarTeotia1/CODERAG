WRITTEN QUESTION E-3251/07 by Carlos Carnero González (PSE) to the Commission (28 June 2007) Subject: Closure of the Robert Bosch factory in Alcalá de Henares (Madrid Region, Spain) The European industrial group Robert Bosch has announced that in January 2009 it is to close the factory which it has operated for many years in Alcalá de Henares (Madrid Region, Spain). This will cause hundreds of people employed directly and indirectly by the factory to lose their jobs. Bosch is in a very healthy situation in Europe and is not suffering from any structural or viability problems which could justify closure of the abovementioned factory. The author of this question considers that the Bosch Group's decision to close its factory in Alcalá de Henares is unacceptable from both the social and the economic point of view and that it goes against the objectives of creating jobs and supporting industrial activity which form part of the EU's Lisbon Agenda and which should be laid down in a code of business practice compatible with the European social model. Hence the author of this question supports the justified claims of the workers, who are organising demonstrations in Spain and Germany (where the Group's headquarters are located) with the backing of the trade-union organisations UGT and Comisiones Obreras in Spain, IG‑Metall in Germany, and CGT and CFDT in France. Is the Commission aware of the situation described above? Does it consider the Bosch decision to be in accordance with the spirit of the Lisbon Agenda and the EU's social objectives? Is it intending to establish whether or not the necessary procedures for informing and consulting workers have been followed, as is required under Community law? What action will it take in order to urge Bosch to reconsider its decision to close its factory in Alcalá de Henares?
