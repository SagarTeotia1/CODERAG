WRITTEN QUESTION E-2459/05 by Jeffrey Titford (IND/DEM) to the Commission (6 July 2005) Subject: Legal and financial authority for Commission activities In view of the clear rejection of the EU Constitution by France and the Netherlands, would the Commission confirm by what legal authority it is continuing with such projects as the development of a European public prosecutor, a European external action service (diplomatic service), a European space policy, a European defence agency and rapid reaction force (armed forces), a European fundamental rights agency, a European police force, and a European asylum and immigration policy? Furthermore, would the Commission confirm in each case the relevant clause of the EU budget which allows the funding of these individual projects?
