the importance of the Constitution for the future of the European Union and their new rights under the Constitution, including the European citizens’ initiative; Economic growth and job creation 5. Reiterates the central role which the Lisbon Strategy will play in generating fresh economic growth in Europe which leads to the creation of high-quality jobs and guarantees the survival of the European social model; takes the view, therefore, that the Lisbon Strategy must reflect two priorities: prosperity and solidarity; 6. Calls on the Member States to conclude the review of the Stability and Growth Pact during the Luxembourg Presidency by finding strong, fair and workable solutions to the issues dealt with under each heading, in keeping with the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 13 September 2004, strengthening the preventive aspects of the Stability and Growth Pact, paying greater heed to differences in economic and social circumstances, and improving the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure and economic governance; underlines that the Commission’s role, particularly in launching the excessive deficit procedure, should be enhanced; 7. Takes the view that investment will be the crucial agent in the modernisation of Europe and that agreement is needed on joint action to boost public and private investment, with special emphasis on those forms of investment most conducive to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, such as research and innovation, new infrastructure, the knowledge-based economy, education and training, high-quality public and social services and investment in a European industrial policy, with the focus on new and dynamic sectors, such as nanotechnology and biotechnology; 8. Notes the Commission’s willingness to revise its proposal for a directive on services; takes the view that, in its current form, that proposal is not acceptable, in particular where it is based on the home country principle; calls on the Commission, therefore, to amend its text in such a way as to make for competition among service providers on the same economic terms and to rule out social dumping among the Member States; 9. Points out that in the internal market services of general interest are currently governed by widely differing conditions and legal practices, whether at European, national or local level; reiterates its call to the Commission to put forward a proposal for a framework directive, in the interests of greater legal certainty, without, however, calling into question the existing provisions specific to certain sectors; emphasises that this single legal framework should clarify, in particular, the division of powers between the Union and the Member States and the principles governing financing instruments; reaffirms, in this context, its commitment to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality; 10. Applauds the Commission’s determination to work to improve the economic, fiscal, technological and legal environment in which undertakings operate, in particular in the services sector, but emphasises that the effective and coherent transposition of Community legislation at Member State level is essential to the proper functioning of the internal market; points out that the functioning of the internal market must go hand in hand with respect for the principles, such as solidarity, fairness and welfare,
