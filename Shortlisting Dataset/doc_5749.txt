been informed by the authorities. Member States would be able to decide to keep all or part of the list confidential. The state responsible for the safety investigation would also be required to appoint a main contact for passengers' families. Trans-European structures in the field of aviation safety At present, conclusions of aviation accident investigations are not analysed at European level. The committee wants the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to analyse such data. MEPs also would like to limit the influence of EASA in accident investigations, as it may be biased since it has responsibility for certifying aircraft. On a different note, MEPs call for a European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities to be set up. They would like it to have more formal powers than proposed by the Commission or some countries in the Council. Due to the negotiations planned with the Council to reach a first-reading agreement, Parliament's plenary vote is likely to be scheduled for September. Christine DE VEYRAC (EPP, FR).
