Anwer given by Mr Marín on behalf of the Commission (16 March 1999) The Commission continues to follow closely the repressive measures imposed upon the Burmese people by the military regime. The Commission fully supports the continued and consistent application of the Union Common Position with regard to Burma. Recent events in Burma give no reason for any change in the Union position and its measures against Burma are therefore maintained.
