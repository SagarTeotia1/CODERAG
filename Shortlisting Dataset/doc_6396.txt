Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (27 July 2006) On 16 May 2006 the Commission presented its monitoring reports on the preparedness of Bulgaria and Romania. These reports are based on a monitoring exercise. Mr Klaus Jansen contributed through a review mission by several experts who assessed preparations in Bulgaria. Whilst the expert opinions are valuable input, the Commission bases its evaluation on all available sources of information. The Commission made public its own reports on 16 May 2006, which conclude that Bulgaria and Romania should be prepared for EU membership on 1 January 2007, provided that they address a number of outstanding issues. This approach is aimed at ensuring the continuation of the reforms in both countries up to and beyond accession. The process of reforming the judicial system in Bulgaria and enhancing systems to combat organised crime and corruption has been under way for many years. As the consecutive annual reports of the Commission show, progress has been made in several aspects of judicial reform. However, a number of shortcomings continue to exist which need now to be addressed. The Bulgarian Government has therefore drawn up an action plan which was supported by the Bulgarian Parliament in a declaration on 14 June 2006. Up to date some important implementing actions have already been undertaken. The Commission will report on the progress of the two countries no later than early October 2006. On this basis, the Commission will consider whether they will be ready to accede on 1 July 2007. In the event of a 2007 accession this report will also specify any areas where safeguards or other remedial sources may be needed upon accession.
