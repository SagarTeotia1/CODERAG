Question for written answer E-006802/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (14 July 2011) Subject: Preservation of archaeological remains in Jerusalem Jerusalem is repeatedly witnessing the destruction and decay of Christian archaeological remains, thanks to interventions by inexperienced restorers, political and religious conflicts and the large number of tourists. The last twenty years have seen the demolition of at least three Christian religious buildings on what is known as ‘Highway No 1’, In addition, a church with a seventh-century crypt dedicated to the Martyrs of Mamilla outside the Jaffa Gate has been pulled down to make room for a bus and coach park. There has also been serious damage to Christian monuments at the archaeological sites of Mamshit, Avdat, Hippos and Khirbet Midras. At the last-named site, in particular, there is no longer any trace of the recently unearthed mosaics, at a location believed to be the sanctuary represented in the Madaba Map and dedicated to Saint Zacharias. The worst-damaged decorations and emblems include the symbol of the cross, which is particularly disliked by those hostile to the Christians. The sculptured cross above the architrave from the famous Church of St Mary of Justinian, now located in the Ophel archaeological park in Jerusalem, has been especially badly damaged: excavated intact forty years ago, it is now worn down to the point where only its decorative elements remain. Does the Commission believe these archaeological treasures should be added to the World Heritage List? What measures will it take to ensure their preservation?
