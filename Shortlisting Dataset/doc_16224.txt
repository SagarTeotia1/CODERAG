and punishing trafficking in human beings and smuggling run by organised criminals, money laundering, and other financial crimes; Creation of a European judicial area 21. Recalls its recent proposals on this subject and openly endorses the Avignon Declaration by the Ministers of France, Italy, Germany , the United Kingdom and Spain proposing the creation of a genuine European judicial area in which: (a) citizens of a Member State who for any reason (victims or perpetrators of an offence, etc.) are brought before the civil or criminal judicial authorities of another Member State are given adequate guarantees and assistance (e.g. interpretation into their own language, free legal aid if they do not have the means to pay for it, and the right to be properly informed about and assisted in connection with the related application procedures), with a convention being established to allow provision for bail to be granted to allow the citizen to return to his/her home country while awaiting trial; (b) common legal standards are attained in order to encourage judicial authorities to recognise the judicial or extra-judicial acts adopted by the judicial authority of another Member State, without the need for an exequatur; (c) European writs of execution are established for the recovery of sums under a certain limit; (d) free circulation and automatic recognition of court rulings are guaranteed through a newly established judicial body (consisting of specialist judges) serving to protect the individual rights of European citizens to the extent required to compensate for the inevitable loss of the judicial review hitherto carried out by the authorities of a Member State requested to enforce a court ruling originating from another Member State; (e) special emphasis is laid on crime prevention, targeted more specifically at juvenile delinquency, a symptom of spreading urban violence, and justice is not merely synonymous with punishment, but above all opens the way to mediation and/or steps to make up for harm done, and educative measures effectively counter the risk that offenders might reoffend; 22.

Member States would enact the necessary legislation to permit domestic prosecution of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture, regardless of where these crimes were committed; Strengthening dialogue between EU institutions and Member States 25. Confirms its determination to involve the national parliaments and representatives of civil society in the creation of the AFSJ whilst respecting the letter and the spirit of the treaties, particularly the protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union; 26.
