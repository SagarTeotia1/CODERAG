Question for written answer P-000513/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 László Surján (PPE) (27 January 2011) Subject: Earthquake in Kraljevo The European Solidarity Fund is available for interventions in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on living conditions, the natural environment or the economy in one or more regions of a Member State or a country applying for accession. The European Parliament recently ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, which is a major step towards Serbia's membership of the European Union. I should like to express my deep commiseration over the severe consequences of the Kraljevo earthquake in Central Serbia, which resulted in an emergency situation throughout the region and in this connection ask the Commission whether the Serbian Government applied for European aid from the European Solidarity Fund and, if so, whether the Commission already has all the required information in order to decide to accord a grant for Serbia. How is the procedure progressing and has any other support been provided by the EU for Serbia to deal with the consequences of this natural disaster?
