WRITTEN QUESTION E-2178/05 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Council (21 June 2005) Subject: Human rights in Turkey We have heard via the organisation War Resisters International that a serious violation of human rights is occurring in the Turkish military prison in Sivas, where the conscientious objector Mehmet Tarhan is evidently suffering serious assaults by his fellow prisoners, to which the prison authorities are very probably turning a blind eye. Mr Tarhan went on hunger strike at the end of May. Sympathisers who have publicly protested about his treatment have been arrested. The Tarhan case is not the only one of its kind. Is the Council aware of the unacceptable situation in Sivas military prison in Turkey and the assaults on Mehmet Tarhan? Does the Council agree that, if Turkey allows such practices, it cannot possibly hope to convince European public opinion that human rights are respected in the country? What steps will the Council take to urge Turkey specifically to put an end to these practices as soon as possible and — in more general terms — to compel this candidate country to honour its pledges on human rights?
