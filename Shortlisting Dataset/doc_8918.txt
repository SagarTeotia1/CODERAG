WRITTEN QUESTION P-3514/08 by Benoît Hamon (PSE) to the Commission (17 June 2008) Subject: Swedish Government plan to broaden the remit of the intelligence agency FRA According to reports in the European and Swedish press, the Swedish authorities are preparing a significant reform of the intelligence service FRA which is designed to broaden substantially its powers to intercept data in the area of Internet communications. 1. Is the Commission aware of the Swedish Government’s plans to broaden the remit of the intelligence agency FRA (Försvarets radioanstalt) in the area of the transmission of electronic data via the Internet? 2. Does the Commission take the view that this plan is consistent with European law, in particular the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Directive 2006/24/EC OJ L 105, 13.4.2006, p. 54. of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public publications networks and Directive 95/46/EC OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data? 3. In connection with the Swedish Government’s plan, is the Commission aware of measures to protect the rights of non-Swedish European Union citizens, in particular as regards the confidentiality of correspondence and personal data and the protection of privacy? 4. In the Commission’s view, how can the Swedish authorities’ plan be reconciled with the proposal for a Council framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (COM(2005)0475)? 5. Does the Commission have information concerning systematic or operational links between this Swedish intelligence agency and organisations in third countries, in particular the Echelon monitoring system referred to in Parliament’s resolutions of 5 September 2001 (A5‑0264/2001) and 7 November 2002 ( P5_TA(2002)0530 )?
