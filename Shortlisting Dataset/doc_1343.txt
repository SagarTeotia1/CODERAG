ORAL QUESTION H-0557/02 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by James Fitzsimons to the Commission Subject: EU support for senior citizens As the Commission will recall, several initiatives have been taken over the years to highlight the positive role played by senior citizens in our society, including the holding of a Senior Citizens' Parliament in Luxembourg in 1993 which called for a Senior Citizens' Parliament in each Member State and a conference in 1998 on 'Senior Citizens in the 21st Century.' Will the Commission firstly ensure that delegates from smaller countries are equally funded at EU level so that they can attend the meetings of the European Federation of Retired and Elderly Persons which, because of EU cut-backs, is no longer possible and, secondly, will the Commission state what action has been taken on the initiatives outlined above and what steps have been taken by Member States to involve the representatives of senior citizens in decision-making bodies at both local and national level?
