codified in Articles 8 to 10 of the Third Life Directive (3LD) see also art.10-13 of the Codified Life Directive 2002/83/EC (CLD), OJ L 345 of 19.12.2002. amending Articles 15, 16 and 23 of the First Life Directive (1LD) Directive 79/267/EEC of 5 March 1979, OJ L 63 of 13.3.1979. . Rules relating to technical provisions and their representation by assurance undertakings (including solvency margins) are codified in Articles 18 to 27 of 3LD amending Articles 17 to 21 of 1LD see also art.20-31 CLD. . Provisions affecting the Conduct of Business rules (COB), including contract law, conditions of assurance etc., are codified in Articles 28 to 31 and Annex II of 3LD in addition to provisions of Articles 4 and 15 of the Second Life Directive (2LD) Directive 90/619/EEC of 8.11.1990, OJ L 330 of 29.11.1990, see also art.32-36 and Annex III CLD. . Finally, provisions applying to assurance undertakings in difficulty were codified in Article 24 paragraphs 2 to 4 (1LD) see also art. 37 CLD. . The Third Life Directive thus provides for the creation of a single market in the EU/EEA for insurance products, based on the rule that the prudential regime in each Member State is recognized as equivalent by other Member States, and an insurance company regulated in one Member State and selling its products across the internal market, can be deemed by host regulatory authorities to have sufficient solvency to sell its products into other Member States, without having to meet there any additional solvency requirements. 1. Applicability of Third Life Directive provisions By contrast to regulations, directives are binding as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods for their implementation see art.249 EC Treaty. . The Third Life Directive had to be transposed by Member States by 31 December 1993 and applied at the latest by 1 July 1994. The formal notification by the UK authorities to the Commission having transposed the 3LD into UK law was on 29 June 1994, confirming its entry into force on 1st July 1994 ES-1 stated that " the UK opted for a piecemeal and indirect approach aimed at adjusting its already complex and sophisticated regulatory system with the principles and standards of the directives. By contrast, Spain and Ireland opted for a more mechanical and consolidated path based on the importation of the Directive into the domestic legal system through the adoption of a single legislative act, which basically reproduced the structure and text of the Directive. In principle... such different forms of transposition are compatible with Community law, (but) the freedom of choice on the methods and forms does not exempt Member States from the binding effects of a directive “as to the results to be achieved”. . This deadline is important when considering the role of UK regulators in the Equitable Life case, as their action in the years 1989-1993 (scrutiny of actuarial reports, prudential supervision) was accordingly ruled by provisions of the First Life Directive (79/267/EEC).
