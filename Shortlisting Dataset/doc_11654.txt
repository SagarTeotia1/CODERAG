WRITTEN QUESTION E-0096/06 by Bernat Joan i Marí (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (20 January 2006) Subject: Non-compliance with EU contract law in connection with the Valencia Community's wind-park plan With reference to the Valencia Community's wind-park plan, I wrote to the Commission on 11 May 2005 in order to report that certain articles of the EC Treaty and of Directives 93/37/EEC OJ L 199, 9.8.1993, p. 54 . and 93/38/EEC OJ L 199, 9.8.1993, p. 84 . had been infringed. In its reply to my Question E‑1820/05, Mr McCreevy (Commissioner) stated on 7 July 2005 that ‘the Commission does not have the necessary information to comment on whether or not awards granted by the Valencian authorities under the plan should be considered public contracts or concessions. (...) The Commission will contact the Spanish authorities in order to obtain all the necessary information to be able to answer the question of the Honourable Member.’ Will the Commission report on the outcome of its inquiries concerning non-compliance with contract law in the case of the contract awarded for the Valencia Community's wind-park plan? On 13 December 2005 the Commission issued a reasoned opinion relating to the Valencia Community's urban-planning law (LRAU), in which it is stated that ‘plans drawn up in accordance with the LRAU constitute works contracts, hence they must comply with the directive on public service contracts and with the general principles of the Treaty, with particular regard to advertising and transparency.’ On that same day the European Parliament adopted the Fourtou report in which it was pointed out — inter alia — that ‘the methods for awarding contracts are not in conformity with European law’. Given that the wind-park plan was drawn up on the basis of regional planning derived from application of the LRAU, does the Commission not think that the views expressed in the abovementioned reasoned opinion could be extended to the case of the wind-park plan?
