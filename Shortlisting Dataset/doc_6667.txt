Reply (23 May 2005) On 15 December the European Union expressed concern about the current political situation in Cambodia, characterised notably by the increase in legal cases political leaders are bringing against one another, the recent suspension of the parliamentary immunity of three opposition members and the arrest of one of these parliamentarians. This situation does not seem to favour a balanced functioning of the institutions, respect for the democratic opposition's rights, national reconciliation or the recovery of a country engaged in establishing the rule of law. The European Union appealed to the leaders of all political parties to work together in a spirit of responsibility and concord in the interest of all the people of Cambodia. The European Union will continue to monitor the situation.
