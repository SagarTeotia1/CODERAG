13.9.2004 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION further to Question for oral answer B6-0013/2004 pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure by Erik Meijer on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group on the 35th session of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly (28 September-8 October 2004) European Parliament resolution on the 35th session of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly (28 September-8 October 2004) The European Parliament , – having regard to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, A. having regard to Motion for a Resolution A35-WP/77, which is to be put to the vote with a view to excluding the possibility of introducing economic measures which are capable of making an effective contribution towards promoting a form of aviation which is less damaging to the environment, B. whereas the EU must as a matter of urgency commit itself with greater determination to the pursuit of actions designed to ensure that the requirements stemming from the Kyoto Protocol are met, C. whereas, in this connection, actions relating to aviation (an activity which contributes to the greenhouse effect) are both urgent and essential, 1. States that the proposals submitted in A35-WP/77 Annex I (concerning aircraft-engine emissions) are unacceptable and that they would significantly restrict the scope for effective action to protect the environment; 2. Calls upon the Council, the Member States and the Commission to oppose the above proposals and to act in such a way as to prompt the international community to step up activities and strengthen proposals which are designed to nurture an ambitious, consistent, incentive-based policy leading to a progressive reduction in the damaging effect which air transport has on the environment; 3. Calls upon the ICAO Assembly, therefore, to reject the proposals; 4. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, to the Council, to the governments of the Member States and the applicant countries, and to the chairman and the members of the ICAO Council.
