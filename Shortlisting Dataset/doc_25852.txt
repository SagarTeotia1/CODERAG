by defining a few innovation priorities based on the EU objectives and on their needs, as identified in their Regional Innovation Strategies, and concentrate earmarked EU resources on these identified priorities; is of the opinion that the capacity of regional decision makers and entrepreneurs to attract and turn knowledge to sustainable competitive advantage is crucial for a region’s economic performance with an added value also for surrounding regions, including parts of neighbouring Member States; 34. Points out that research and innovation, in particular as regards the development of low or zero carbon emissions and energy savings, are of critical importance for addressing global challenges, such as climate change and security of energy supplies, and also for improving competitiveness at regional and local level; 35. Supports the proposal of the Committee of the Regions for the creation of a ‘virtual creativity network’ that would be open to all (businesses, local and regional authorities, central public authorities, the private sector and citizens) and would provide advice, assistance and access to venture capital and technical services; stresses that a virtual network offers the additional advantage of giving the inhabitants of islands, outlying regions, rural areas, mountain areas and sparsely populated areas easier access to expert advice, education and information, business support and financial guidance; 36. Points out that transnational cooperation is the essence of FP7 and CIP, and that territorial cooperation (via transnational, interregional and cross-border programmes) is mainstreamed in the Structural Funds; calls on the Commission to reinforce the European territorial cooperation objective in the future, through its further mainstreaming; invites the Commission to evaluate the possibilities of enhancing territorial cooperation in the field of innovation in each cohesion policy objective; points out that better knowledge of the results of FP7 and CIP at regional level would facilitate practical coordination between the EU Regional policy and these programmes; urges the Commission to pay particular attention to such coordination; encourages Member States to take further measures for effective transnational cooperation by developing coherent regional and national strategies for achieving synergies; calls the Commission and Member States also to facilitate development and accessibility of data on this issue; 37. Stresses that under the Seventh Framework Programme support is granted to transnational cooperation in its different forms both within and outside the EU, in a number of thematic areas corresponding to the main fields of knowledge and technology, within which it is necessary to support and consolidate high-quality research in order to tackle the social, economic, environmental and industrial challenges facing Europe; 38. Calls on the Commission to analyse the impact of simplification measures already taken on the management of the Structural Funds with a view to preparing the future legislative framework; 39. Acknowledges that both shared and centralised management require specific rules and that the top-down approach of FP7 and CIP and the bottom-up approach of Structural Funds each have their own merits; underlines, however, the need to harmonise the rules, procedures and practices (eligibility rules, standard unit costs, lump sums, etc.) governing different instruments and to ensure better coordination (of schedules of calls for proposals,
