WRITTEN QUESTION E-5222/06 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (1 December 2006) Subject: Spain's application of European legislation on the use of mercury Spain has decided to delay application of the European legislation setting October 2007 as the deadline for ending the use of mercury owing to its harmful effects. According to information published in the press, the Spanish Environment Ministry wishes to permit the use of mercury, which is highly damaging to health, in the chlor-alkali industry for a further 13 years. If this information is correct, the Spanish Environment Ministry has apparently signed an agreement with undertakings in the industry postponing application of the measure until 2020. Mercury is harmful to health because it accumulates in animals, particularly fish, from where it can be passed on to people with damaging effects on the immune, cardiovascular and reproductive systems. The Spanish Environment Ministry appears to be putting the economic considerations before the health considerations. Given that Spain is among the countries that make most use of chlor-alkali compounds, and bearing in mind the danger posed by mercury and the European directive setting a deadline for ending its use, is the Commission aware that Spain is to delay application of the European directive ending the use of mercury? If so, will the Commission take any action in this regard?
