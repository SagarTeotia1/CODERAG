WRITTEN QUESTION E-0524/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Council (4 February 2009) Subject: Italy — Slovenia — Croatia summit European integration is progressing with one eye on the past and the other on the future. Although ‘will be’ is undoubtedly a more important verb than ‘was’, Europe still has many items of business left unfinished from the past. One example is the quarrel between Italy and Slovenia (also involving Croatia, a country that will be joining the EU). Few words are needed to sum up the situation: about now Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia should have been holding a reconciliation summit, the idea being that no one should forget the atrocities perpetrated by both sides during the Second World War (the Risiera di San Sabba concentration camp and the Basovizza foiba (mountain gorge)). The Slovene President has refused to attend such a meeting on account of Italy’s alleged ‘ethical deficit’ regarding the crimes of the Fascist era and the fact that, given the subsequent developments, the time is still not ripe for a reconciliation. President Türk has, in addition, accused some leading Italian political figures of attempting to equate the Fascists with those who fought them. The reality, as history shows, is altogether different. What does the Council intend to do, therefore, about this matter? Does it not consider the Slovene Government’s attitude to be contrary to the essential principles of the EU, which are built on mutual respect?
