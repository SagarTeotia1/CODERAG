WRITTEN QUESTION E-5658/06 by Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 December 2006) Subject: Licensing of air carriers Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on the licensing of air carriers lays down the conditions under which a Member State may impose a public service obligation relating to scheduled air services. From 1 January 1999, the Portuguese Government imposed amended public service obligations on scheduled air services operating on routes in the Azores, in Commission Notice 98/C 267/04, on routes to and from Funchal, in Commission Notice 98/C 267/05, and on the route Funchal — Porto Santo — Funchal, in Commission Notice 98/C 267/06, all published on 26 August 1998. The Portuguese Government recently decided to revise Commission Notices 98/C 267/05 and 98/C 267/06, as stated in Commission Notice 2006/C 280/07 of 18 November 2006, applying a fuel surcharge on links between Funchal and Porto Santo and between Funchal and mainland Portugal. 1. Can the Commission say what justification was provided by the Portuguese Government for amending the public service obligations defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on the licensing of air carriers? 2. Can the Commission assess compliance with public service obligations during these years in relation to scheduled air services on the routes covered by the present revision? 3. Can the Commission assess the extent to which, with respect to Madeira, there has been a change in the conditions determining the application of public service obligations pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92, which might justify the revision?
