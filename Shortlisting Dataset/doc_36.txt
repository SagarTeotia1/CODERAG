year to the partner countries. The bulk of these funds is for basic education for children. Specific actions to eliminate child labour include the broad cooperation agreement signed by the Commission in May 2001 with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on decent work, the external dimension of the EU's social agenda and the social dimension of globalisation. Against this background, in July 2004 the ILO and the Commission signed a strategic partnership in the field of development. One of its priorities is to eliminate child labour. To this end the Commission and its African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) partners have proposed an action plan to combat child labour in collaboration with the ILO's International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC). The action programme will focus on capacity building, targeted interventions and a legal framework designed to help ensure that children who no longer have to work have access to primary education. The estimated total budget is nearly EUR 15 million. The ACP ambassadors’ Committee on sustainable development adopted the initiative in July 2005. The definition of the multi-country programme is underway and will soon be submitted to the European Development Fund (EDF).
