Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (19 March 2012) The Greek Government has committed to ‘stand ready to offer for sale its remaining minority holdings in state-owned enterprises (with public control, in the form of minority shareholdings, limited only to cases of critical network infrastructure)’. The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the memorandum of understanding dated 31 October 2011 which is available online http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2011/op77_en.htm, pages 120 and 133. . This means that the government is prepared to sell more assets than those listed in the multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) Framework included in the approved law of 1 July 2011 Ref. Government Gazette Number 152. . It is not the role of the Commission to quantify these commitments considering the uncertainty of market conditions and the subsequent uncertainty of how and when the currently planned assets will be sold. Moreover, the emphasis should not rest exclusively on asset sales and revenue generation, but more broadly on how the privatisation process can support economic recovery and improve potential growth in the Greek real economy.
