WRITTEN QUESTION P-5000/09 by Esther de Lange (PPE) to the Commission (9 October 2009) Subject: European School Fruit Scheme Following the Commission proposal for a School Fruit Scheme of 8 July 2008 (COM(2008)0442) there is an assigned budget of EUR 1.3 million for ‘networking activities, in order to motivate the exchange of information and knowledge among SFS actors and stimulate public awareness’. The 2009/2010 school period started a month ago, but there seems to be a lack of communication on the School Fruit Scheme. There is no document available giving an overview of the programmes. Members of the fruit and vegetables sector have had no indication of how to participate in the programme and many schools seem to be unaware of the programme. There is still no website on the School Fruit Scheme with information on national strategies and communication kits. The promised yearly networking meeting between the Commission, national authorities and Member States is supposed to take place in 2009, with a view to the new application deadline of 31 January 2010 (for the school period of 2010‑11). The two expert groups — one scientific group for the evaluation and monitoring of the schemes, and another with stakeholders for networking and exchange of best practices — have not yet been created. In short, I have not seen any results concerning the use of the EUR 1.3 million assigned for networking activities and communication. I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following questions: 1. Could the Commission confirm that the budget of EUR 1.3 million will be used for these objectives, and how has the Commission used this budget so far? 2. When will the website dedicated to the School Fruit Scheme be online and what will its content be? 3. When will the 2009 networking meeting between the Commission, Member States and interested stakeholders take place? 4. When will the expert groups be formally created?
