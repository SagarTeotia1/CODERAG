WRITTEN QUESTION E-6016/08 by Emmanouil Angelakas (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (6 November 2008) Subject: Natural gas cartel On Tuesday, 23 October 2008 representatives of Russia, Iran and Qatar, three countries which between them hold 60 % of world natural gas reserves, held a meeting in Tehran in Iran. It was announced that a natural gas cartel would be set up along the lines of OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Counties). Given that the energy dependency of EU countries on Russian natural gas is very substantial (over 40 % of the natural gas used in the EU is of Russian origin) but also in view of the particular state of EU‑Russia relations at present following the Caucasus crisis, will the Commission say: 1. What impact does it believe the establishment of a natural gas cartel will have on the EU's ability adequately to meet its energy needs and on the maintenance of prices at agreed levels? 2. Given that the signature of a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia has been ‘put on ice’, how does the Commission estimate that this new development will affect the process as a whole?
