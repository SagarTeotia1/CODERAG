Question for written answer E-004782/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Franz Obermayr (NI) (17 May 2011) Subject: EU Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the agricultural industry — conflicts of interest I refer to my question of 28 October (E‑8743/2010) in which I clearly expressed my concerns about the possible involvement of EFSA advisers with the agricultural industry and conflicts of interest. Definite links between EU advisers and the agricultural industry have now been exposed once again, and a report by the journalist Claire Robinson, that should be taken seriously, reveals that experts from EFSA cooperate with the agricultural industry. The report is entitled ‘Europe’s pesticide and food safety regulators — Who do they work for?’ (http://www.powerbase.info/images/e/ee/Eu_pesticidefoodsafety.pdf) This April 2011 report also states that the Italian scientist Angelo Moretti has already had to resign his membership of an EFSA advisory body, as he was also working with a company and was advising chemicals firms on how to deal with the EU Chemicals Regulation (REACH). Mr Moretti was said to be working on several projects for the EU, including pesticide risk assessments. Other members of advisory bodies have repeatedly been accused of conflicts of interest with the agricultural industry, including the scientists Alan Boobis, Diána Bánáti, Milan Kovác and Theodorus Brock. According to the reports, the International Life Science Institute (ILSI), which is close to the industry, also makes constant efforts to influence EFSA. Until recently EFSA used to publish lists of its advisers on the Internet, but the names have now been removed from the website. 1. What is the Commission’s position on the recurring accusations against EFSA advisers? 2. Why are the names of EFSA advisers no longer to be found on the EFSA homepage on the Internet, as they were previously? 3. What does the Commission intend to do to prevent any conflicts of interest of this kind arising?
