Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (5 September 2007) As the Honourable Member underlines, Member States could not reach agreement on the proposal for a framework decision on certain procedural rights in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union, which is still pending at Council. The Commission's proposal aims to ensure that suspects are guaranteed fundamental rights such as the right to effective legal advice, the right to free interpretation and the right to the translation of documents. The Commission's proposal provides also for a ‘letter of rights’ by which the suspect if informed about his/her rights. As the framework decision has not yet been adopted, Member States apply their domestic rules which differ from one country to the other.
