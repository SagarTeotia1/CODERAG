Question for written answer E-001234/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (10 February 2012) Subject: Manufacturing sector A recent study shows a record fall in production and significant job losses in the Greek manufacturing sector. Businesses are finding it difficult to gain access to working capital and companies are not managing to use their credit lines and usual methods of payment to conduct their operations normally. The decline in new orders has caused a dramatic decrease in production, as a result of which Greek businesses are continuing to shed their workforce. Given on the one hand, the unfortunate economic situation of Greece and on the other hand, the fact that similar problems can be seen in other sectors in the majority of Member States, this is a European problem which requires a European response. In view of this: 1. In what specific ways does the Commission intend to increase investments in Member States, particularly for small and medium-sized undertakings, which are the backbone of EU economic growth and necessary for the development and competitiveness of the EU? 2. Can it provide further information on what instruments it has at its disposal and if it intends to use them for financing the manufacturing sector and avoiding collective redundancies? 3. What measures will it take to ensure that the provisions applicable in the EU Member States are examined carefully and brought into line with Council Directive 75/129 EEC relating to collective redundancies?
