Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2009) Regarding the Honourable Member's first question, the Commission considers that the abrogation of the Constitution and the other measures taken by the authorities in Fiji over Easter jeopardise Fiji's credibility to fulfil its obligations under the Cotonou Agreement. In fact these developments constitute a breach of several of the specific commitments which Fiji gave the EU in April 2007. Regarding the second question, the Commissioner responsible for Development and Humanitarian Aid issued a statement on 16 April 2009 in response to the regressive developments in Fiji, and on 21 April 2009, the EU Presidency issued a Declaration on behalf of the EU on the situation in Fiji. Furthermore, direct contacts were made with the authorities in Fiji regarding the most recent developments, and on 3 May 2009, Fiji's acting Prime Minister declared publicly that Fiji is seeking new consultations with the EU under the article 96 procedure of the revised Cotonou Agreement. The EC, and indeed the EU, is also working closely with all relevant international parties, including the Pacific ACP African, Caribbean and Pacific States. countries, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Commonwealth and the United Nations, regarding Fiji's evolving crisis. Regarding the third question, the Commission has physical proof of censorship in Fiji and is fully aware of the other human rights concerns referred to in the Honourable Member's question. As a general measure the EU provides co-financing to human rights non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Fiji. It is hoped that the continuing political dialogue and eventual future consultations will allow for progress regarding general human rights issues as well as specific human rights cases, as has been the case with Fiji in the past.
