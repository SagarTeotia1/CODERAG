WRITTEN QUESTION E-3564/06 by Jean-Claude Fruteau (PSE) to the Commission (28 July 2006) Subject: Industrial policy and relocations The case of a manufacturing company in the Hautes-Alpes that was suddenly relocated to Germany has, from a social perspective, recently refocused attention in France on the perverse effects of the rules in force at European level on assistance for company start-ups. As is often the case, the reasons for withdrawing from the original production site do not actually lie in the company's economic viability, but rather in states' and regions' rushing to incentivise the setting-up of production facilities by means of direct or indirect aid (fitting-out grants, tax exemptions, exemptions from social charges and even direct payment of a proportion of salaries) which, in the case in point, may total 45 % of the production costs. While public sector intervention to encourage wealth generation is a vital tool for assisting areas in difficulty, it is important for its prime role not to be distorted by ‘subsidy hunters’ seeking to profit from competition between different European regions, which is contributing to the development of social and tax dumping. Given these circumstances, what will the Commission do to better regulate the granting of this type of assistance, within the ambit of a genuine and cohesive European policy that can ally industrial dynamism in the Union with the protection of vulnerable areas?
