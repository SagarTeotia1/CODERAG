distributed according to the prevailing rules on modulation and would remain in the regions or States in which they accrued. This progressive modulation, applicable over the period 2009-2013, would consist of a reduction of 1% of the total of direct aid from €10,000 to €100,000, 2% for €100,000 to €200,000, 3% for €200,000 to €300,000 and 4% for payments over €300,000. The House would also prefer modulation to be compulsory for all Member States rather than voluntary for some (namely the UK and Portugal) as at present. No re-nationalisation of the CAP Parliament say modulation should not lead to re-nationalisation of the CAP and the level-playing-field between Member States should be respected as much as possible. Article 69 revised, a key to new types of support ? The European Parliament believes that the current "Article 69" mechanism, which enables Member States to keep and reallocate up to 10% of direct aid to their farmers under the first pillar, should be reviewed so that funds are devoted as a priority to the preservation of livestock farming in mountain areas, those with water shortages, wetlands or disadvantaged areas, the restructuring of key agricultural sectors (e.g. the dairy and sheep sectors), area‑based environmental measures (e.g. organic farming) and risk management. Preparing for the end of the dairy quota system Aware that the current system of milk quotas is unlikely to be continued after 2015 in its present form, the European Parliament asks the Commission to put forward a convincing plan for the dairy sector for the period after 2015. MEPs argue for a 2% increase in dairy quotas in the milk year 2008/2009 on a voluntary basis for each Member State (see our separate article on milk quotas). European Quality Mark MEPs call on the Commission to introduce a 'European mark' to identify the quality of EU agricultural and food production on the European market as well as international markets, and identifying the strict standards, in relation to the environment, animal welfare and food safety under which production takes place. Concern over supply Finally, the House considers the scrapping of all form of regulation within the CMOs to be politically undesirable since, as the current situation shows, European and global reserves stand at dramatically low levels, which is having negative repercussions on consumer purchasing power and farmers’ incomes while at the same time encouraging speculation. The House emphasises that, besides this, instruments are needed to combat a potential economic downturn and the risks posed by health incidents and increasingly frequent natural disasters arising from the unsettled climate.
