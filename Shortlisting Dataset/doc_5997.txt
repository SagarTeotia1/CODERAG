of an amendment of the Comitology decision, should mean that the Commission must make a review and propose any commensurate changes regarding the directive and that this review must by carried out at the latest by 31 December 2007. The proposed compromise thereby transforms the sunset clause into a more useful and appropriate format in this context, ensuring that the Commission's right of initiative with regard to future proposals is not tampered with and without making any adjustments to the Commission's existing powers. The amendment retains para 1 and part of para 2 of Amendment 10 of the draft Report, which have been accorded in the securities sector EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The quality of the legislation which is today being adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, and which tomorrow will apply to hundreds of millions of European citizens and will govern the economic and social rules of the game for European companies, has become a fundamental imperative for the European Union. This basic principle, applicable of course to legislation on financial services, is one of the objectives of the approach supported by Mr Lamfalussy in his report to the Ecofin Council in 2001, which specifically concerned the improvement of such legislation with a view to ensuring that texts are drafted in a simple, clear, consistent and, of course, sound way, as well ensuring as the utmost transparency in the legislative process. More than just words, there is an ultimate political objective, namely to ensure respect for the democratic legitimacy of European legislation and in particular to safeguard the effective exercise of the role of the European Parliament and its political responsibility. That is the principle by which we are constantly guided in our approach to the role of the European Parliament in connection with the implementation and extension of the Lamfalussy process. 1) Political context of the extension of the Lamfalussy process It was only possible for the European Parliament to accept, in its resolution of 5 February 2002, the Lamfalussy process for securities because the process was accompanied by very strict institutional requirements, in particular a 'sunset clause' providing for the powers of delegation conferred on the Commission to be revoked at the end of a specified period and a form - admittedly limited - of 'call back' for implementing measures. The Lamfalussy process, it may be recalled, provides, on the basis of four levels of action, for legislation on financial markets to be adopted in two stages: fundamental policy choices in the form of general rules, adopted by codecision, and more detailed technical measures necessary for achieving legislative objectives, adopted by the Commission in accordance with these framework principles. In order to implement these new legislative arrangements, and in the light of the forthcoming revision of the Treaties, it had been agreed to apply the only procedure existing at the time of the introduction of the Lamfalussy process capable of lending itself to this approach, namely the provisions on comitology. However, Parliament, for its part, has always disputed that the comitology procedure is an appropriate instrument, given that it
