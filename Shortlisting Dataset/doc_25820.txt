Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2011) As a general principle, the labeling of foods, including their sale name, must not mislead the consumer as to the characteristics, the nature and the composition of a food. In particular, according to the EU food labelling legislation Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labeling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, OJ L 109, 6.5.2000. , in the absence of Union legislation, the name under which a food is sold shall be that provided for in the legislation applicable in the Member State in which the product is sold. If no national rules exist (the Commission is not aware of such rules concerning the use of the name ‘caprino’), the name shall be a description of the food which is clear enough to let the purchaser know its true nature and distinguish it from other products with which it might be confused. Accordingly, the use of the name ‘caprino’ which clearly identifies goats' milk might by questionable for cheese derived from cow milk. The assessment whether or not the description used by a food business operator fulfils the abovementioned criteria is carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all information provided on the label, including the list of ingredients. In addition Members States are better placed to assess compliance taking into account also applicable legislation and in particular on trade marks and ‘brand’ names.
