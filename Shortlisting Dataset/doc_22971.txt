Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (22 February 2008) The EU‑Turkey Association Council Decision 1/98 sets out the norms on EU‑Turkey trade in fisheries. As this decision does not contain specific rules or obligations with regard to state aid, there are currently no Community provisions limiting Turkey's ability to grant state support to its fisheries industry. So far, this issue has not been raised in subcommittee meetings with Turkey. The next meeting of the EU‑Turkey Association Council is scheduled for May 2008 and the Commission will consider the inclusion of this specific point on the agenda. The Commission is aware of the existence of an aquaculture support scheme aimed at improving the productivity and quality of aquaculture production in Turkey and discussed this issue with the Turkish administration in detail during the bilateral screening of the fisheries chapter. In the framework of EU accession negotiations on the fisheries chapter, Turkey will have to undertake specific commitments to bring all such schemes in compliance with EU rules. In the beginning of 2005 the Commission explained to industry representatives the procedural and substantive requirements necessary to warrant the initiation of an anti-subsidy investigation by the Commission, the first of which is the presentation of a duly documented application showing prima facie evidence of injurious subsidisation. The Commission remains at the full disposal of the industry to further discuss this matter. The Honourable Member may rest assured that the Commission will act as soon as the requirements of the law are fulfilled. Any such action will of course have to take fully into consideration the provisions of our agreements with Turkey, which also provide for bilateral consultations, including on matters concerning possible infringement of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
