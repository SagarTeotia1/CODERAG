Question for written answer E-007683/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (4 August 2011) Subject: Marketing of cruises Directive 90/314/EEC states, in Article 2(1), that ‘package’ travel should be considered to be ‘the pre-arranged combination of not fewer than two of the following when sold or offered for sale at an inclusive price and when the service covers a period of more than twenty-four hours or includes overnight accommodation: (a) transport; (b) accommodation; (c) other tourist services not ancillary to transport or accommodation and accounting for a significant proportion of the package.’ The ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in cases C-585/08 and C-144/09 examines the criteria underpinning the concept of a ‘package’ to determine whether the services offered in these cases are comparable to a cruise, which would justify the conclusion that there is a ‘package’, and stipulates that: ‘[a]s the Court has already held, for a service to qualify as a package within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 90/314, it is enough if, first, it combines tourist services sold at an inclusive price including two of the three services referred to in that provision … and second, it covers a period of more than 24 hours or includes overnight accommodation.’ In this regard, there can be no doubt that, in addition to transport, the freighter journey to which the ruling refers includes accommodation for an inclusive price and lasts for more than 24 hours. Accordingly, such a service fulfils the necessary conditions to be considered a ‘package’ within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 90/314/EEC and falls within the definition, set out in Article 15(3) of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, read in the light of Article 2(1) thereof, of a contract of transport at an inclusive price. Regulation (EU) No 1177/2010 defines a cruise as ‘a transport service by sea or inland waterway, operated exclusively for the purpose of pleasure or recreation, supplemented by accommodation and other facilities, exceeding two overnight stays on board’. The regulation adds, in Article 2, that it does not apply to ‘passengers on excursion and sightseeing tours other than cruises’. Does the Commission consider that the simple fact of marketing a cruise under Regulation (EU) No 1177/2010 must have repercussions on the notion of package travel under Directive 90/314/EEC on package travel, package holidays and package tours, or should it be considered a stand‑alone service, within the category of transport services?
