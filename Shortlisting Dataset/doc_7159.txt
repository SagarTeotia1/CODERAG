ORAL QUESTION H-0725/03 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Patricia McKenna to the Commission Subject: Embryonic stem cell research With the ongoing debate and controversy surrounding the issue of whether it is appropriate for the EU's Framework Programme to decide to allow funding of embryonic stem cell research, what kind of a budget does the Commission envisage for research using embryonic stem cells? How many embryos could be destroyed in this process? In which Member States are these embryos? Why does the Commission support research on embryonic stem cells when it has been proved that adult stem cells constitute a sound scientific alternative?
