Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (2 December 2008) The balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities is a complex matter. It can only be assessed on the basis of detailed data per fishery and by taking into account both biological and economic factors. The Danish report for the year 2006 was the only one which included this type of assessment. The Belgian, German, Dutch and Swedish reports included assertions in relation to the size of some of their fleet segments, stating either that reductions in capacity were required or that the size of the fleet segment was adequate to the resource. However, no detailed analysis was provided to justify these assertions. The remaining reports only provided information on the trends in fishing capacity or fishing effort but did not make clear statements regarding the balance between fleet and fishing opportunities.
