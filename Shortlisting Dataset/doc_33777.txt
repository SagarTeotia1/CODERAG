WRITTEN QUESTION P-5625/07 by Ivo Belet (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 November 2007) Subject: VAT reduction on energy-efficient products According to reports from the Commission, the Ecofin Council of 13 November discussed Franco-British proposals to reduce VAT on environmentally friendly or energy-efficient products. Which specific products are concerned? Would these products be added to Annex III of the VAT Directive, and would the reduced VAT rate thus be optional for the Member States? Or is the idea that there should be a reduced VAT rate throughout the EU? If so, in what legal form would this be put into practice? Is consideration also being given to applying the zero rate (e.g. to new sustainable products in the construction sector)?
