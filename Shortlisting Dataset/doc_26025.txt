respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. It is up to each Member State to determine the rules governing healthcare cover under their social security system. It is also up to each Member State, in compliance with Community Law, to determine the conditions on which benefits provided by their sickness insurance scheme are granted, how organ seeking is organised and how reimbursement is arranged. The issue of organisation of transplant services in Greece raised by the Honourable Member, therefore, falls primarily within the scope of national competence.
