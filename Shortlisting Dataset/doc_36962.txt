Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (23 October 2008) The Commission is not aware of any public financing arrangement that may have been put in place to the benefit of the planned Castellon Airport. The Commission normally assesses state aid to airports according to the Community guidelines OJ C 312, 9.12.2005. on financing of airports and start-up aid to airlines departing from regional airports, to the Commission decision of 28 November 2005 on the application of Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty to state aid in the form of public service compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest OJ L 312, 29.11.2005. and to the Community framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation OJ C 297, 29.11.2005. . The Commission will write to the Spanish authorities to determine if any public financing has been granted and/or is planned.
