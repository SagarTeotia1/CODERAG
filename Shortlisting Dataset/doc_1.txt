Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (2 August 2006) Conditions, tariffs and other elements related to Public Service Obligations are the responsibility of Member States, who notify the relevant texts for publication. The Commission supervises the correct execution of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992, on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes OJ L 240, 24.8.1992. . The revised conditions published in 2004, include the following: ‘Reduced fares for residents of the Autonomous Region of the Azores and for students whose place of residence is within the Autonomous Region of the Azores and who study elsewhere in Portugal or vice versa of no more than: (i) EUR 179 return for residents, on flights between the Azores and the mainland; (ii) EUR 139 return for students, on flights between the Azores and the mainland; (iii) EUR 98 return for students, on flights between Ponta Delgada and Funchal’ OJ C 64, 12.3.2004. . The question raised by the Honourable Member can best be addressed with the Portuguese authorities. In the meantime, the Commission will write to the Portuguese authorities asking for clarifications on their interpretation of the text and of their assessment of the implementation of this Port and Shipping Organisation (PSO) in practice.
