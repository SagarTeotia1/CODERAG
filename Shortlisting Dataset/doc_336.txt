WRITTEN QUESTION P-0956/08 by Nickolay Mladenov (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 February 2008) Subject: Pricing of international calls — at home and in roaming Since the introduction of the Roaming Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 OJ L 171, 29.6.2007, p. 32. , European consumers have access to roaming services at significantly more reasonable prices than before. The implementation of the regulation has, however, led to some discrimination with regard to international calls. Prices of international calls were left out of the scope of the regulation and now we have the following awkward example. A customer may, on average, pay a higher per-minute rate for making an international call from their home Member State (to a second Member State), than if they were making the same call, while roaming, when the Roaming Regulation applies. Does the Commission plan to investigate this anomaly, and propose measures that can rectify such situations and ensure that European consumers are not disadvantaged if making intra-EU mobile calls from their home country?
