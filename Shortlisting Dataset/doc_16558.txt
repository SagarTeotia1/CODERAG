active in this field. Since its start in 1997, 24 projects concerning FGM have been co-financed under Daphne, including projects with the following aims: creation of a European Network for the Prevention of FGM in Europe (1st phase) and strengthening the Network by building on experiences and results from the early past (2nd phase); development of community methods, in order to prevent the mutilation of Somali girls’ and women’s sexual organs; development and production of an FGM teaching kit and the training of community/religious leaders, women and other communicators on its use; evaluation of the impact of existing legislation in Europe with regard to FGM These projects have studied national legislation, collected data and statistics, developed tools and best practices for practitioners and recommended policy directions aimed at decision-makers in the EU and national governments. One Daphne project has provided an inventory of existing legislation in the 15 Member States before 2004 and a comparative analysis of existing legislation applicable on FGM in Belgium, France, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom with regard to FGM. However, the Commission does not have comprehensive information readily available on existing legislation in the other Member States. For further information regarding projects financed under the Daphne Programme since 1997, please see the website ‘Daphne Toolkit’: http://www.daphne-toolkit.org. The website, and related DVD, contains detailed information, ideas, materials and lessons from all previous (completed and on-going) projects, as well as related links and resources. Finally, numerous projects have been funded in third countries under other Community assistance programmes, such as the MEDA programme (with FMG projects in Egypt for example), and the European initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
