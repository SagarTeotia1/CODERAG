Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (30 October 2006) Article 18 of the EC Treaty stipulates that every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect. The respective limitations and conditions are to be found in Directive 2004/38/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States OJ L 158, 30.4.2004 . . Article 5(1) of the directive, read together with Article 3(1), provides for the right of Union citizens to enter the territory of a Member State other than that of which they are a national. According to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, this right is also applicable in the situations where there is a link to the exercise of the right to move and reside freely, such as when Union citizens return home from another Member State after they exercised their right to move and reside freely there. Danish nationals returning to Denmark after having exercised their right to move and reside freely in another Member State are thus upon entry entitled to be treated in accordance with the directive, together with their family members who accompany or join them in Denmark. Community law on free movement of Union citizens does not apply to Union citizens who have not made use of their right to free movement within the territory of the Member States., It is therefore up to each Member State to lay down rules on entry of their own nationals returning from outside the European Union, including the rules on entry of their family members. Given the above, the difference in treatment on entry into Denmark of Danish nationals returning from another Member State and Danish nationals returning from outside the European Union does not raise any concerns of violation of Community law.
