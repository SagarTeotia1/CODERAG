ORAL QUESTION H-0764/03/rev.1 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Marit Paulsen to the Commission Subject: General plan for crisis management In November 2002, I asked the Commission ( H-0791/02 ) for its views on a kind of 'Richter scale' for food scares which would be based on various questions to be answered by the competent authorities (e.g. 'Is a change in eating habits recommended?'). The Commission replied that 'all justified concern and relevant experience' would be taken into account when the Commission, in cooperation with the EFSA and the Member States, drew up the general plan for crisis management in accordance with Regulation (EC) 178/2002 . A crisis management plan is apparently in the process of being drafted at the present time. Can the Commission say what the intended content of the plan is in terms of components and tools, how it is to be tested on consumers and what pressure will be exerted on the national authorities to cooperate over risk communication? Written answer of 17.12.2002 OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1
