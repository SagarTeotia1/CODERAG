Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2007) The Honourable Member's written question refers to the discharge of untreated sewage from the localities of Cee, Corcubion, Sardineiro and Fisterra (Galicia region, Spain) into the bay of Ria de Corcurbion. The total of discharges from all these localities would amount to 5000 residents. The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive Directive 91/271/EEC, OJ L 135, 30.5.1991. provides for an obligation to collect and treat waste water in all sufficiently concentrated settlement areas (‘agglomerations’) of more than 2000 population equivalents Population equivalent (p.e.) = unit for waste water pollution, equalling the average daily pollution of one person. . The deadlines are staged 1998, 2000 and 2005, depending on the size and the characteristics of the affected waters; in the case of the settlements mentioned in the questions and the character of the Ria de Corcubion bay, these should be equipped with collecting systems and waste water treatment plants by 31 December 2005. The European Commission is about to start a comprehensive assessment of the compliance with the 2005 deadline set out in the directive, within the newly developed electronic Water Information System for Europe (WISE). WISE will be launched at a European Water Conference on 22 March 2007, and will, inter alia , ensure earlier, targeted and comparable information on waste water across Europe. An evaluation of the bathing water quality data of the beaches in this region of Galicia shows, for all beaches, compliance http://ec.europa.eu/water/cgi-bin/bw.pl?name=CEE&water=-1&call=5&calc=ES111&code=ES7115023&level=6. with the mandatory standards under the Bathing Water Directive Directive 76/160/EEC, OJ L 31, 5.2.1976. , and beyond this, for the vast majority of the beaches, compliance with the (more stringent) guideline values. Should the forthcoming compliance assessment reveal non-compliance with the requirements of the directive, the Commission, in its role as Guardian of the Treaty, will not hesitate to take the steps necessary, including, where appropriate, legal infringement procedures.
