ORAL QUESTION H-1026/08 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2009 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Kathy Sinnott to the Commission Subject: Home Choice Loan The Irish Government’s Home Choice Loan was introduced in the Budget of October 2008. The Choice Loan is to provide mortgages through a number of local authorities for first time buyers who cannot get sufficient finance from a bank or building society. The maximum amount provided will be €285 000, up to 92% of the ‘market value.’ It will apply only to newly built houses. Does the Commission consider that this scheme is in breach of Community law? Does the Commission consider that this distorts the market, supporting prices as well as favouring developers of new housing in a market where there is a large oversupply of unoccupied new houses? Does it favour new buyers over those who for whatever reason have previously owned a house? Does it create a subprime mortgage programme? Will it commit new buyers to paying inflated prices in a declining market?
