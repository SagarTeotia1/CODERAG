Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2006) In its Progress Report published on 9 November 2005 SEC(2005)1426. , the Commission made a detailed assessment of the situation in Turkey as regards the Copenhagen political criteria. The 2005 year report follows the same approach applied to all other candidate and negotiating countries in previous years. In particular, the report assesses progress both in terms of legislation and in terms of implementation throughout the different areas arising under democracy and the rule of law, human rights and protection of minorities. Detailed information can be found under the relevant sections, concerning the fight against torture, fundamental freedoms including freedom of religion, cultural rights, trade union rights, children rights as well as civil-military relations. In addition, following a proposal by the Commission, the Council approved in December 2005 a revised Accession Partner, which lists all the relevant priorities that Turkey needs to meet in order to align with the Copenhagen criteria. The priorities under the political criteria list the progress that Turkey is expected to achieve in the area of human rights, both in terms of legislation and in terms of implementation.
