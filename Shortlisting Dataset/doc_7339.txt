Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (17 November 2010) Two main legislations are applicable in the European Union to limit the pollution by metals from mines and processing plants namely the Industrial Pollution Prevention Directive (IPPC) (Directive 96/61/EC OJ L 257, 10.10.1996. ) and the directive on the management of extractive waste (Directive 2006/21/EC OJ L 102, 11.4.2006. ). On 8 November 2010, a proposal to recast the IPPC Directive into a Directive on industrial emissions (IED) was adopted by the legislation authority. This new law strengthens obligations concerning incidents and accidents, non-compliance and inspections. The strict application of these two key Directives should ensure the safety of mining waste facilities and processing plants and ensure that metal pollution from EU based activities is limited to the minimum possible.
