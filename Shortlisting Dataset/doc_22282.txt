Question for written answer E-004160/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marina Yannakoudakis (ECR) (29 April 2011) Subject: Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a life-threatening viral disease transmitted primarily by blood contact. There are an estimated 12 million EU citizens infected with the Hepatitis C virus, which dwarfs the levels of HIV infection in the EU, estimated at 2.2 million people. The vast majority of people in this huge Hepatitis C patient pool, up to 80%, are unaware of their condition. In fact, both the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have highlighted the fact that Hepatitis C is a major public health problem. The European Parliament acknowledged the seriousness of the Hepatitis C problem and in particular the scale of its under-diagnosis as an important EU health problem in its Written Declaration from March 2007, which, amongst other issues, called for a Council Recommendation on Hepatitis C screening. In light of the recent WHO resolution on viral hepatitis and the ECDC reports, is it not time for the European Commission and Council to pay heed to the European Parliament’s call and acknowledge the EU-wide importance of this problem by adopting such a Council recommendation? In this way, Member States will be guided to adopt best practices, to encourage awareness and to introduce essential screening programmes to tackle the disease, which can be treated effectively.
