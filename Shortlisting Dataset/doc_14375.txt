Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (12 December 2005) The deficit target of the 2005 budget approved by the Greek Parliament at the end of 2004 was 2.8 % of gross domestic product (GDP). This was based on a 2004 deficit outturn of 5.3 % of GDP and a growth rate of 3.9 % for 2005. The revised updated stability programme 2004‑07 presented by the Greek Government in March 2005 was based on a more plausible macroeconomic scenario for 2005 than the budget 2005. GDP growth was projected at 2.9 %, compared with 3.9 % in the budget law. This was in line with the Commission spring 2005 forecasts. The updated stability programme included also the additional measures announced on 29 March 2005 by the Greek Government, which were in effect on 1 April 2005, and amounted to some 0.4-0.5 % of GDP. In addition, the 2004 deficit outturn had been modified from 5.3 % of GDP to 6.1 % of GDP. The combined effects of the revision of the 2005 growth rate, the revisions of the deficit outturn for 2004 and the effects of the additional measures are behind the discrepancies between the deficit target in the voted budget and the new target in the updated stability programme. On the basis of a Commission communication, which took account of the information in the updated stability programme, as well as of the spring 2005 forecast, the Council concluded on 6 April 2005 that Greece had taken action consistent with the recommendations of its notice in accordance with Article 104(9) of the Treaty, which, among other things, required a rigorous implementation of the 2005 budget. According to the Council notice, the rigorous implementation of the 2005 budget would lead to a deficit target of 3.6 % of GDP. This deficit target of 3.6 % of GDP for 2005 has been confirmed by the Greek authorities in the excessive deficit procedures notification, as well as in the draft 2006 budget submitted to Parliament on 3 October 2005. Taking into account the report submitted by the Greek authorities at the end of October 2005 and the Commission services autumn 2005 forecast released on 17 November 2005, the Commission will assess compliance by the Greek authorities with the Council notice. The evaluation will be based on the implementation of the 2005 budget and on subsequent measures adopted by the government as well as on the final budget for 2006.
