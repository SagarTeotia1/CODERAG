WRITTEN QUESTION E-1184/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Council (26 February 2009) Subject: Violence against Christians in India India’s Christian community is continuing to be subjected to violence. After the very serious damage caused in August last year by the attacks on 315 villages in Kandhamal district — in which Christian churches and institutions were burned down and more than 50 000 Christians driven out of their homes, resulting in a final toll of 60 dead and over 15 000 injured, and in numerous assaults on Christian women and nuns — Christian villages, this time in the state of Orissa (south-east India), have again been the scene of destruction and aggression by Hindu extremists. Religious fundamentalism is thus again spreading terror and fear, and claiming new victims; and this is happening, moreover, in India, a country where the system, based as it is on caste and social divisions, is stifling the democratic values on which its institutions are officially founded. Does the Council not consider that a response is now required at international level in order to prevent further violence of this sort being perpetrated against the Christian minority in India? What pressure can and will it exert to ensure that freedom of worship is respected in real life, and not just on paper?
