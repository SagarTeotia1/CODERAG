Question for written answer E-004824/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (19 May 2011) Subject: Chernobyl Twenty-five years after the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Ukraine Government is seeking international funding for the purchase of a new stronger and more voluminous sarcophagus to cover the previous one, so as to seal off the damaged reactor which is still leaking radioactivity. In view of the fact that Europe has pledged EUR 110 million for the purchase of the sarcophagus and that radioactivity cannot be contained by borders: Before pledging the funds did the Commission make enquiries to establish whether the new sarcophagus will be a provisional or permanent solution? What is the half-life of the radioactive materials contained in the damaged reactor? What is the likelihood that, in a few years’ time European taxpayers will be called on to provide still more funding yet another sarcophagus?
