ORAL QUESTION H-0089/07 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Sajjad Karim to the Council Subject: Zimbabwe Current EU sanctions against Robert Mugabe’s regime end on 20 February 2007. Following 'Operation Murambatsvina', the forced eviction of hundreds of thousands of people living in informal settlements across the country in 2005, the Zimbabwean Government has repeatedly hindered UN efforts to provide emergency shelter and subjected some of the most vulnerable people to repeated forced evictions. Bearing this in mind, along with well-documented human rights abuses suffered by those who oppose Mr Mugabe’s regime, is the Council able to give assurances that the EU’s refusal to accept these violations will be demonstrated through a renewal of sanctions?
