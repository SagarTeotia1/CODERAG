Whereas some 90 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including emerging economies, which are collectively responsible for more than 80 % of global emissions, have made unilateral declarations of quantified economy-wide emission reduction objectives, albeit not legally binding; B. whereas the European Parliament and the European Council have declared their ambition to secure an 80 to 95 % level of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; points out that a linear trajectory between 2009 and 2050 would result in a 2020 target in the range of 34-38 % as compared to 1990; C. whereas the European Union must agree specific targets for emission reductions to provide the basis and framework for the necessary legislative acts and other measures; D. whereas the Roadmap demonstrates that the current 20 % climate target, of which more than half could be achieved through non-domestic offsets, is not on a cost-effective pathway towards a 80 % reduction in 2050 as compared to 1990; whereas 80 % is on the low end of the 80-95 % range which the IPCC considered necessary for industrialised countries, and which the European Council adopted as the EU target for 2050; E. whereas industry needs
