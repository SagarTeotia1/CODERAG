Question for written answer E-002707/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Christel Schaldemose (S&D) (9 March 2012) Subject: EU trading standards for imported fruit and vegetables from third countries In accordance with EU trading standards for imported fruit and vegetables from third countries, import information must be sent to the authorities in the relevant recipient country at least 24 hours before arrival. I support the import rules, which are intended to ensure that the products offered to consumers are safe and healthy. However, there have been a number of cases in Denmark of misunderstandings arising between the authority and the importer with regard to the notification obligation. The rules are quite clear on this: late notification will result in fruit and vegetables being returned to the sender country, even if they do not they contain harmful substances or similar. Unfortunately, because the food is perishable, this increases food wastage. I am not proposing a general dispensation, but that the authorities be allowed the option of a dispensation in appropriate circumstances. My question in relation to this is whether, in connection with the forthcoming revision of the rules, the Commission will propose a more flexible scheme, allowing the authorities the option of granting a dispensation from the rules in special circumstances?
