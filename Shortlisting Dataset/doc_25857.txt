level; 2. Is convinced that commitment by the political leadership is both a necessary precondition for research and innovation policy coherence and a tool to enhance it; with that in mind, calls for the establishment of a strategic policy framework for research and innovation adjusted in the light of progress, new information and changing circumstances and consistent with national goals and priorities for economic and social development; 3. Notes with satisfaction that, for the period 2007-2013, within the Structural Funds (SF) EUR 86 billion is allocated in support of innovation (25% of the total amount), of which the allocation for core research and technological development (R&D) amounts to EUR 50 billion, equal to the total budget of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7); 4. Believes that the impact of these earmarked funds could be further improved through complementary use of, and better coordination between, regional, research and innovation policies at EU, regional and local level; calls on the Commission to pay particular attention to such coordination and encourages Member States to take further measures for effective trans-national cooperation by developing coherent regional or national strategies for achieving synergies; 5. Believes that an administrative culture that promotes cross-sectoral co-operation and continuous dialogue between different policy communities contributes to the strengthening of policy coherence; 6. Believes – while acknowledging that Community programmes such as SF, FP7 and CIP differ in their primary focus, mechanism and administration – that diverse rules, procedures and practices unnecessarily hinder effective implementation; calls for a more harmonised approach (to eligibility rules, standard unit costs, lump sums, etc.), better coordination (of schedules of calls for proposals, themes and types of calls, etc.) and more exchange of information between the different programmes; sees a clear need for more expertise at the regional level regarding application for Community funding, administrative and financial procedures, fund management and financial engineering; in this connection, calls on the Commission to act as a facilitator and to provide joint guidance on Community funding opportunities through ex-ante guidance notes; 7. Believes – given the fact that the implementing bodies of the EU instruments concerned exist on different levels (supranational, national and sub-national) and are governed by a different rationale (e.g. cohesion vs. excellence) – that the guaranteeing of actual policy coherence constitutes a major challenge, especially ‘on the ground’ where EU instruments mix with national and regional policies; 8. Notes that actual synergies from the point of view of the direct beneficiary of funding depend on the beneficiary’s organisational and strategic capacity to combine support from different EU instruments; calls on the regional actors to create regional strategies that can facilitate the combination of funding; requests the Commission therefore to evaluate the possibility of providing additional expert support through a ‘user manual’ as well as means for the exchange of good practices; 9. Calls on regional and local authorities to make better use of the SF to build up research, knowledge and innovation capacity in their regions, for instance by setting up research infrastructure, enabling them to take part in EU research and innovation activities; encourages regions
