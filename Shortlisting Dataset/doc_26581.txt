WRITTEN QUESTION E-6499/07 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (10 January 2008) Subject: Energy performance of buildings and the European Directive for the Energy Performance of Buildings (EPBD) What is the Commission’s assessment of the UK government’s decision to delay its roll-out of energy performance certificates, to be phased by building sector from April 2008, under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive of December 2002 (2002/91/EC)? The Commission will be aware that under Article 15 of this directive, on its transposition into national law, Member States may, because of a lack of qualified and/or accredited experts, have an additional three years to apply fully the provisions of Articles 7, 8, 9. Yet given that there are currently 6 002 qualified assessors (number accredited as of 29 November 2007) and a further 4 664 in the system awaiting full accreditation, is the Commission satisfied that the delay to the roll-out is fully justified under these terms? In view of this, will the Commission consider putting pressure on the UK Government to hasten its roll out of EPCs, as is required under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive?
