WRITTEN QUESTION E-3109/05 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) and Kartika Liotard (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (12 September 2005) Subject: The need for large aircraft to discharge surplus kerosene in the air if their schedules are disrupted and the impact on the environment and public health 1. Is the Commission aware that large aircraft undertaking intercontinental flights, such as the Boeing 747, cannot land safely with a full fuel tank and that this causes problems if, shortly after take-off, they have to deviate from their planned route and return to the airport of departure, for example due to the failure of an engine, damage caused by a collision with a bird, the need for urgent medical attention for a passenger, or temporary closure of the airport at their destination due to weather conditions or a terrorist threat? 2. Is the Commission aware that problems of the kind referred to at 1 are currently solved by discharging kerosene into the air in flight, often above the sea or a lake, but if necessary also over residential areas where residents find oily residues on their washing, cars and garden furniture? 3. Is it acceptable that oil products should continue to be discharged into the natural environment in this way, contributing to pollution and possible health problems? 4. Is the Commission aware of the narrowly avoided disaster in the 1990s when kerosene was discharged near the large DSM chemical works at Geleen in the south-east of the Netherlands, which could have had serious consequences as far afield as Germany and Belgium? 5. How can such major risks be eliminated in the near future, for example by imposing additional requirements on new aircraft regarding the quantity of fuel to be carried or safety of landing if an aircraft still has a large quantity of fuel on board? What will the Commission do to contribute to this? Source: Rotterdams Dagblad , 17 August 2005.
