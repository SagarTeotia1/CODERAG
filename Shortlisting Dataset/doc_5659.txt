WRITTEN QUESTION P-4238/08 by Niels Busk (ALDE) to the Commission (18 July 2008) Subject: Sensitive products At the centre of the WTO negotiations is the concept of sensitive products that would give WTO partners the right to nominate certain products as ‘sensitive’; allowing higher levels of import protection in exchange for opening up import quotas that could lead to a fixed volume of products imported at a low tariff rate. There are clear signs that WTO members such as Australia and New Zealand are using this measure in order to get substantial increases in market access for dairy products into the EU by the tariff quotas created by the sensitive product status, even when the EU does not see the need for calling in sensitivity for these products. The concept of sensitivity in this view is no longer a defensive instrument for the importer but would become an offensive instrument for the exporter. — Is the Commission making any commitments to New Zealand, Australia or any other WTO member to open tariff rate quotas for cheese or butter under the pretext of sensitivity at this stage of the negotiations? — Would the Commission consult the main stakeholders before deciding which products should be nominated for sensitivity?
