Question for written answer E-006389/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antolín Sánchez Presedo (S&D) (30 June 2011) Subject: Responsibilities of credit rating agencies It has been reported in the media that following a lengthy investigation, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is allegedly considering various options for taking legal action against credit rating agencies for their role in the early stages of the crisis. According to the information which has been published, legal proceedings against credit rating agencies have already been started in countries such as Portugal, Greece, Germany and Spain as a result of private claims. Is the Commission aware of the investigations carried out by the US Securities and Exchange Commission? In view of the impact of the decisions of credit rating agencies in the EU and given that their repercussions on the sovereign debt differential has been documented by the IMF, has the Commission carried out or does it intend to carry out a similar type of investigation? Does the Commission consider that the behaviour of these agencies can be addressed by an initiative similar to that being undertaken by the US authorities?
