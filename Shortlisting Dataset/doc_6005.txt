its report: Text proposed by the Commission Not yet published in OJ. Amendments by AFCO Amendment 1 Recital 6 a (new) 6a. The commitments made by the European Commission regarding securities legislation via the letter from Commissioner Bolkestein of 2 October 2001 and the declaration of President Prodi of 5 February 2002 are not a sufficient long term guarantee of a commitment of the Council concerning a proper institutional balance for the four-level approach. Therefore the Council should commit itself to agree with the Commission's proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 1999/468/EEC, as amended by the European Parliament December 2002, proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 1999/468/EEC, COM(2002)719 . EP Resolution A5-0266/2003 , adopted on 2 September 2003 (P5_TA (2003) 0352). . Amendment 2 Recital 6 b (new) 6b. The only satisfactory way to deal with the problems of institutional balance in comitology is by adopting a Treaty derived from the one establishing a Constitution for Europe, as drafted by the Convention on the future of Europe. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference accepts the substance of the Convention text . Amendment 3 Recital 6 c (new) 6c. In the mean time, the European Parliament understands the urgency of the measures extending the Lamfalussy process and therefore supports the reform of the financial services committee structure, provided that a mechanism enabling the Parliament to reject secondary legislation is included. Democratic accountability and transparency must be inherent in the Lamfalussy process, which can only appropriately be guaranteed by such a mechanism. Amendment 4 Recital 7 a (new) 7a. The proposed extension of the Lamfalussy procedure is without prejudice to possible decisions regarding the organisation of supervision at a European level.
