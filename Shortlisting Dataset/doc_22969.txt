Preliminary answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (13 June 2008) The Commission does not share the view expressed by the Honourable Member that islamophobia is a non-existent phenomenon. The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) published reports on islamophobia before the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) came into existence. The Commission attaches high importance to the Scientific Committee of the Agency being put in place as soon as possible. The procedure of appointment, by its own nature, takes a certain amount of time, not unlike other procedures that have been necessary to transform the EUMC into the FRA. The publication of reports by the Agency before the Scientific Committee is in place is not inconsistent with Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 of 15 February 2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, OJ L 53, 22.2.2007. . Regarding questions 2, 3 and 4, the Commission has asked the FRA to provide the elements of the reply. The reply of the Agency will be transmitted to the Honourable Member by the Commission as soon as possible.
