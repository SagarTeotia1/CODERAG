Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (30 January 2008) The Commission agrees that gender considerations should be taken into account in tackling climate change and its impacts. Climate change will affect all of us and the Commission sees adaptation to unavoidable climate change as an essential part of climate policy in the EU and internationally. But since the consequences of climate change specifically affect vulnerable groups — including women — the Commission fully shares the view that gender considerations need to be considered in strategies to adapt to the consequences of climate change. The Commission also believes that policy responses to climate change, especially in developing countries, should rely on existing good practices on the proactive role of women in environmental policies and decision-making. This is a dimension that the Commission is notably considering when integrating climate change considerations into its development policy and projects. Following the agreement reached in Bali at the last Conference of the Parties of the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, negotiations towards a comprehensive post 2012 agreement have started, with a view to reach an agreement by 2009. The EU intends to play a leading role in these negotiations with a view to securing an ambitious outcome, consistent with the need to limit climate change to 2°C. Adaptation, alongside with mitigation, finance and technologies, is one of the key building blocks and will therefore feature high in these negotiations.
