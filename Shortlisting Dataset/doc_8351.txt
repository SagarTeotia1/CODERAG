Reply (4 October 2006) The Council is aware of the specific case referred to by the Honourable Member and follows it closely. The Council has repeatedly underlined the importance it attaches to the issue of freedom of expression. This is one of the key areas where further sustained efforts are needed in order to ensure that the exercise of freedom of expression in Turkey is in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and in accordance with the relevant case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. The Honourable Member is aware that certain provisions of the Turkish Penal Code — including Article 301 — contain terms vague enough to be open to interpretation by judges and prosecutors and on this basis a number of cases are still pending against individuals for non-violent expression of opinion. This issue has been systematically raised by the EU at all levels as part of the ongoing reform process in Turkey. At the latest meeting of the EC‑Turkey Association Council held in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006, the Union side clearly stated that, if judges and prosecutors continued to give a restrictive interpretation of these provisions, Turkey would have to amend the vaguely formulated articles in line with the relevant EU standards. Against this backdrop, the Honourable Member can be assured that the Union will continue to closely follow developments in this area and raise the issue at all levels as appropriate.
