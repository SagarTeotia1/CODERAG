Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2010) 1. For the period 1990 until July 2010, the Commission has imposed fines (adjusted for Court judgments) to a total of EUR 15 204 113 092. (In the period 1990‑94: EUR 344 282 550; in the period 1995‑99: EUR 270 963 500; in the period 2000‑04: EUR 3 166 247 910; for the period 2005‑09: EUR 9 753 714 300; in 2010 (until July): EUR 1 668 904 832). The statistics on the Commission’s competition website are regularly updated and can be consulted under http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/statistics/statistics.pdf. The Commission does not keep statistics on how fines can be attributed to undertakings of a specific Member State. This is due to the fact that it is often not clear to which Member State such fines/undertakings should be attributed. For example, a company may be listed on the stock exchange in one Member State, have its registered office in another, and its management in yet another; over the lifetime of the illegal activity, one or more of these factors may also have changed. The Honourable Member should also note that the EU competition rules against cartels have also been applied by the National Competition Authorities in the Member States Notably since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, OJ L 1, 4.1.2003. . 2. The Commission does not have figures regarding the costs resulting from defending cases before the Court or the costs of its investigations. 3. The Commission's cartel enforcement activities focus on cross-border cartels, often covering the entire European Economic Area (EEA) or a large part of the EEA. It is therefore not possible to single out certain countries in which cartel violations occur more frequently. For example, of the nine cartel decisions adopted in 2009 and 2010, seven related to infringements covering the entire EEA or almost the entire EEA. One cartel (Bathroom Fittings) related to six countries and one cartel (E.ON/GdF) concerned two countries. 4. The Commission closely follows developments in accession and pre-accession countries in the field of cartel enforcement. All Stabilisation and Association Agreements concluded (or to be concluded) with these countries include provisions requiring the adoption of antitrust rules and the establishment of operationally independent competition authorities. The accession countries have cartel rules which are enforced with increased rigour and effectiveness as competition authorities gain experience. This applies in particular to Turkey which has a well-functioning competition authority. Although they may still lack experience and enforcement capacity, cartel enforcement is one of the top priorities for competition authorities in the transition economies of the western Balkans. 5-7. When carrying out a cartel investigation, the Commission does not examine whether the companies subject to the investigation have received EU funding. Cartel investigations and procedures for the allocation of EU funding pursue different objectives and are not linked. The fact that a company has received subsidies has no bearing on the amount of the fine that could, or should, be imposed on this company for a cartel violation. 8.
