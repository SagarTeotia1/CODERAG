WRITTEN QUESTION E-2731/06 by Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL) to the Council (21 June 2006) Subject: Compatibility of Swedish collective agreements with the services directive Labour law is an area which is exempt from the services directive. It is also stated repeatedly that the right of employers and employees to conclude collective agreements will not be affected by the services directive. Does this imply that Sweden has an unqualified right to require Swedish collective agreements for workers of foreign companies which are covered by the services directive and provide their services on Swedish territory?
