at narrowing the gender pay gap. Greater action, awareness-raising, and supervision are needed at the workplace in order to create better working conditions for women, taking into account working times, compliance with maternity and paternity rights and their social function in terms of work-life balance and calling for wider uptake of maternity and parental leave, with full pay, the establishment of paid paternity leave, and remedies where the above rights are challenged. It is necessary to adopt the policies and actions required to eradicate violence against women in every walk of life, promoting women’s human rights, combating gender stereotypes and all forms of discrimination in society and the family, not least in education, training, the media, and politics; policies must serve to educate and to promote equality. Every attention should be brought to bear on the situation of women working with their spouses in agriculture, craft industries, commerce, or fisheries and on that of small family businesses, in which women are in a more vulnerable position than men; new measures should be taken to protect mothers, eliminate indirect discrimination, safeguard welfare provision, social security, and other entitlements accorded to women, including those working in a self-employed capacity. In spite of the progress in the area of sexual and reproductive health, there are still many unresolved problems, and women therefore have to be given control over their sexual and reproductive rights. It is essential to ensure compliance with a number of important EU resolutions, not least those of 10 February 2010 on preventing trafficking in human beings ( P7_TA(2010)0018 ) and equality between women and men in the EU ( P7_TA(2010)0021 ).
