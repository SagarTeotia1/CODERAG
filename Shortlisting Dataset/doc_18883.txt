WRITTEN QUESTION E-6001/07 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Council (4 December 2007) Subject: The EU's underwater archaeological heritage Recent weeks have seen a dispute between the Spanish Government and the Odyssey treasure-hunting company, due to claims that the contents of a Spanish wreck have been pillaged. The ‘Odyssey Explorer’ was tied up for six months in Gibraltar, from whence the treasure was exported by air to the USA; when it left Gibraltarian waters and entered those of Spain, the Spanish authorities seized and held the vessel in order to search it. Now the company is demanding 5 million euros in damages. The wreck may actually be lying in Spanish territorial waters, although the company denies this, but will not provide the coordinates of the location; the ‘Odyssey Explorer’ removed some 500 000 silver and gold coins, valued at circa 500 million US dollars. The nature of the coins found appears to indicate, furthermore, that the wreck is a Spanish vessel which sank in the 17th century, which would mean that the treasure is part of Spain's and therefore Europe's cultural heritage. How does the Council view these facts? What is its position with regard to the preservation of European underwater property? Furthermore, given that the treasure was removed from Europe without any problem at all from British territory, does the Council not believe that greater controls need to be exercised by each and every Member State, and that there needs to be greater cooperation between Member States in order to avoid similar situations arising in the future?
