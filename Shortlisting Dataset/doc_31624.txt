WRITTEN QUESTION P-3897/08 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) to the Commission (4 July 2008) Subject: Illegal shipments of waste from Europe to third countries The IMPEL‑TFS Enforcement Actions I final report, published this week, reveals that 15 % of all waste shipments from the EU are illegal. That figure of 15 % breaks down as follows: 9 % are shipments for which the papers are not in order and 6 % are shipments of illegal hazardous waste which are to be processed cheaply or simply dumped in third countries. All this points to a poor level of compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 OJ L 190, 12.7.2006, p. 1. on shipments of waste. The report sets out recommendations on improving that situation, in particular: — greater high-level political and administrative support for compliance with the relevant legislation; — the creation of a more level playing field; — the launching of Enforcement Actions II as a successor to the current project. 1. In the Commission's view, what is the reason for the patchy compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006? 2. Can the Commission give some indication of the scale of the damage which is being caused to public health and the environment by illegal shipments of waste from the EU to developing countries? 3. What specific steps does the Commission plan to take in order to improve the monitoring of compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006? 4. Does the Commission take the view that greater political and administrative priority must be given to the enforcement of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006, does it endorse the aforementioned recommendations set out in the IMPEL‑TFS Enforcement Actions I report (see also pages 33, 34, and 35), and if so, what practical steps does the Commission plan to take to implement the first recommendation? 5. Does the Commission regard it as desirable that impact assessments of new Commission legislative proposals should take greater account of practical issues concerning compliance with and enforcement of legislation?
