well-being. The objective of the project is the development of biomarkers that could be followed after a GM food is released on the market in order to monitor the GMO-induced immunogenic and allergenic response in animals and humans, which could be used to predict harmful GM food effects after product authorisation. The three-year project started August 2008 and will end July 2011. The FP5 project Allergest http://allergest.technion.ac.il aimed to expand current allergenicity assessment strategies regarding GMOs to encompass the whole organism and not just the target transgene, and to include novel food processing, ingredients and foods, especially nutritionally-enhanced foods. But, in order to obtain an overall picture on the issue of allergies, the Commission is currently finalising a study on ‘The collection and evaluation of data on incidence and severity of skin and respiratory allergy related to exposure of chemicals from non-food sources’ in order to obtain data which would allow the consideration of possible policy and research options to address this problem and ensure a high level of health protection. The EU also supported, under the Quality of Life programme, the ‘European Community Respiratory Health Survey I http://www.ecrhs.org/Home.htm and II http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/reprint/18/3/598 ’, which were the first studies to assess geographical variations in the prevalence of asthma and allergy in the European Union using the same instruments and definitions. The European Union has adopted measures to reduce exposure to identified chemicals with a known allergic potential by its regulatory frameworks addressing reduction of exposure to e.g. man made chemicals from the environment or at the work place, from consumer products and from food. Annex XVII of the REACH Regulation Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC, OJ L 396, 30.12.2006. prohibits the use and marketing of certain dangerous substances including sensitising ones such as nickel and chromium in consumer products. A ban under the General Product Safety Directive Directive 2001/95/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 11, 15.1.2002. was introduced from 1 May 2009 for dimethylfumarate (DMF) which is a sensitising substance causing severe skin reactions in consumers and was found particularly in leather products.
