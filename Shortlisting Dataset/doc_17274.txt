WRITTEN QUESTION E-0745/07 by Panagiotis Beglitis (PSE) to the Commission (19 February 2007) Subject: Procedure for appointing the new director of the Commission's Representation in Greece The procedure for appointing a new director of the Commission's Representation in Greece was completed recently. Taking into account the fact that this appointment was long delayed and the intense coverage that preceded it, and the information which was later aired in the Greek media, will the Commission say: 1. Why did the competent authorities not ensure that they had completed the internal administrative selection procedure in good time so as not to leave the Commission Representation without a director for a considerable length of time after the departure of the previous director? 2. What are the specific criteria and qualifications required for the post of director and what checks are carried out to ensure that these requirements are met? 3. To what extent does the government of a Member State participate in and bear responsibility for such an appointment? 4. Is the Commissioner responsible familiar with the procedures which were followed and, if so, does she endorse them as Commission policy? 5. What steps are being taken to ensure transparency and meritocracy, principles which European institutions should respect and subscribe to? 6. How does the Commission defend its institutional role and image vis-à-vis the citizens of a Member State and, more generally, public opinion both within and outside the EU?
