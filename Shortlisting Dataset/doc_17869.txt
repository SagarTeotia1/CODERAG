WRITTEN QUESTION E-2087/10 by Nessa Childers (S&D) to the Commission (7 April 2010) Subject: Missing children hotline number The 116000 EU missing children hotline number was launched in 2007 by the Commission, which called on Member States to introduce the initiative. As of January 2010, only 11 Member States have provided this service — Belgium, Denmark, Greece, France, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Slovakia. In February 2009 the then EU Telecoms Commissioner Ms Viviane Reding said ‘It is good news that the missing children's hotline 116000 is now working in five states; however, I would have expected a more ambitious approach from other Member States; there is no room or time for complacency when it comes to the safety of our children’. Ms Reding continued: ‘I am calling on Member States to live up to their responsibilities and inform service providers of the availability of the 116 Nos, so we can quickly get the hotlines running across the EU. Beyond legal obligations, which I will continue to enforce vigorously, there is a moral obligation to European parents and children’. This service is still not available in my home state of Ireland. Lack of funding is the main reason why Ireland has not introduced this service. However, there have also been other political and administrative obstacles. What is the Commission doing to address the implementation (or lack thereof) of the children's hotline number? What action is the Commission currently taking with this service?
