DEVE "Empowering the rural poor to be part of the solution", Lennart Båge stated In his statement addressed to DEVE Committee on 1st April, President B å ge of IFAD underlined that agriculture is central to poverty reduction, but pointed out that most African governments spend less that 5% of their budgets on this sector. Beyond public authorities, farmers' organisations can play a key role on empowering the rural poor. Four hundred million smallholder farmers should not be viewed as a problem: their productive potential is vital to ensure food security, combat climate change and reduce poverty. 20080403CAN25696 Statement under "Committee meetings" More information on Mr Lennart Båge IFAD's President speeches and statements 2007
