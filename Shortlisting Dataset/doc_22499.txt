WRITTEN QUESTION E-0399/06 by Klaus-Heiner Lehne (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (7 February 2006) Subject: Freedom of movement within the EU; Financial Assistance Regulation of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany While visiting Austria, a retired German judge from the Federal Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, who was entitled to financial assistance (with medical insurance) was taken to an Austrian hospital by air ambulance. The journey by air ambulance was medically indicated. The Land Pay and Care Office (Landesamt für Besoldung und Versorgung) of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia refused to take account of the cost of the journey by air ambulance because it had been incurred abroad. According to the Financial Assistance Regulation of North Rhine-Westphalia, no financial assistance is paid towards transport costs incurred abroad. In this light, is it compatible with Community law for national state agencies to reimburse only transport costs incurred within their country to retired people with medical insurance entitling them to financial assistance, and to refuse to reimburse necessary transport costs incurred elsewhere in the EU purely on the grounds that they have been incurred abroad?
