9999/C Q999 E/078 WRITTEN QUESTION P-0321/04 by Daniel Cohn-Bendit (Verts/ALE) to the Council (29 January 2004) Subject: EU embargo on arms sales to China The arms embargo was imposed on China in 1989 after the tragic events in Tien An Men square. Ever since, the human rights record of China has not shown any sign of improvement, since there still is widespread use of capital punishment, plenty of political prisoners, and repression of religious freedom and of minorities with regard in particular to Tibet and Xin Yang. Further to this, aggressive stances against Taiwan have increased. On 18 December the European Parliament adopted a resolution by overwhelming majority calling on the Council and the Member States to maintain the EU embargo on trade in arms with the People's Republic of China (P5_TA(2003)0599). Has the Council studied and considered this resolution? Should not the process of consultation with Parliament lead the Council to take it duly into account? Given the fact that the human rights and security situation in China has not improved since, why did the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meeting of Monday 26 January launch a review of this embargo? Can the Council confirm or deny that it is its intention to abolish the embargo altogether at the European Council meeting of 25 and 26 March? Can the Council confirm that besides France it is Austria, Italy, Spain, and Greece which are in favour of lifting the embargo, while other EU Member States are more reluctant to do so?
