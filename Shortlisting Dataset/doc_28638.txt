WRITTEN QUESTION E-2977/09 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (22 April 2009) Subject: Written Question E‑0869/09 I am grateful for Commissioner Rehn's answer to my Written Question E‑0869/09. The Commission must again raise the issue of the urgent and full implementation of the Cyprus v Turkey decision of the ECHR of 10 May 2001 with the Turkish Government. Does it intend to do so?
