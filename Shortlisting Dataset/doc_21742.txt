WRITTEN QUESTION E-5527/09 by Jean-Luc Bennahmias (ALDE) to the Commission (10 November 2009) Subject: Draft statutes for a European association and a European mutual society In September 2005, the Commission unilaterally withdrew the draft statutes for a European association and a European mutual society from the legislative procedure, on the grounds that there was a need for ‘administrative simplification’. Since then, the statute for a European cooperative society has been adopted, and the draft statute for a European foundation has been launched. These two initiatives are proof of the Commission's desire to support the development of operators in the social economy, in agreement with all the other Community institutions (Parliament, Council, EESC, ECJ, etc.). However, despite the requests made by the European Parliament and the EESC in particular, the draft statutes for a European association and a European mutual society have still not been re-submitted to the legislative procedure. This delay is obviously damaging for the intra-Community development of these two key components of the social economy, especially of mutual societies which have a prominent position in the insurance and welfare sectors. In addition to upholding the social values and services of public interest performed by these operators, the primary aim is to allow, and provide a framework for, Community-wide structural approximation that respects both the specific economic and social identity of the operators concerned and the interests of European citizens. 1. Can the Commission say whether it plans to re-submit the draft statutes for a European association and a European mutual society to the legislative procedure and, if so, when? 2. Does the Commission intend to take other initiatives promoting company law in the social economy sector?
