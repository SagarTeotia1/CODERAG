Strongly supports the partnership with societies approach and thus calls on the Commission and the Vice-President/High Representative to develop mechanisms to ensure its full application, in particular by setting up a mechanism involving civil society in the definition of objectives and benchmarks and in the implementation and monitoring of all agreements with partners, by maintaining a transparent dialogue on JHA matters with democratically elected authorities and national parliaments, and by enhancing Parliament’s democratic scrutiny of all mechanisms, dialogues and agreements on migration; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Council urgently to address the refugee crisis by conducting an enquiry into the shipwrecks of boat people and related cases of failure to lend assistance at sea, in cooperation with the Commissioner for Human Rights and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, by asking the EU Members States to make public the agreements concluded with third countries, by providing support to the countries concerned, and, in particular, by exploring the possibility of setting up humanitarian corridors and unblocking without delay the negotiations on the Joint EU Resettlement Programme; calls on the Member States, in partnership with the UNHCR, to resettle refugees having fled Libya who are still stuck in camps on the Tunisian and Egyptian borders and whose lives would be endangered by a return to Libya on account of the abuses being committed against sub-Saharan peoples; calls on the Commission to clarify the precise circumstances in which Member States subject to a ‘disproportionate influx of displaced persons’ could avail themselves of the provisions of Directive 2001/55/EC on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons; calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that there is a follow-up to the Commission communication entitled ‘Evaluation of EU Readmission Agreements’, in particular as regards respect for fundamental rights in the implementation of such agreements.
