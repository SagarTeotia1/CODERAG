Question for written answer E-010062/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Filiz Hakaeva Hyusmenova (ALDE) (7 November 2011) Subject: Automatic decommitment of budgetary commitments Under the current legal framework relating to the Structural Funds and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the Commission automatically decommits any portion of a budget commitment made for an operational programme that has not been used for the purpose of prefinancing or for interim payments, or for which no declaration has been sent by 31 December of the second year following that of the budget commitment to the programme. Does the Commission have any information or assessments on how much European funding will be automatically decommitted at the end of 2011? Which programmes are most at risk of seeing the n+2/n+3 rule applied, and what is the state of play, in this regard, as concerns operational programmes in Bulgaria?
