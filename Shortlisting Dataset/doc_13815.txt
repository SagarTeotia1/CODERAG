of labour traditions, contractual forms and business models existing in labour markets, highlighting the need, against this background of diversity, to give priority to protecting European models and established labour rights; recommends the adoption of a bottom-up approach in developing new employment strategies so as to facilitate dialogue and the involvement of political and social authorities at all levels; 4. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to recognise and support the special position of independent freelance workers as a vital force in economic recovery, as a ’way in’ or an alternative to the labour market; notes that independent working is growing in popularity, especially among young workers and women and as a transition from work to retirement; believes that independent freelancers should be treated as a unique subset of micro-businesses and calls for measures to be taken to minimise the burden of regulation and to encourage and support independent freelancers in launching/growing independent freelance businesses and to promote lifelong learning for this group; 5. Emphasises the importance of self-employment, particularly for micro- and small businesses, and highlights the importance of the liberal professions, with their particular characteristics; emphasises that the term ’liberal profession’ simply denotes a particular skilled occupation which can also be pursued independently; 6. Considers that all employees, regardless of their employment status, should be guaranteed a set of core rights; recommends that the priorities for labour law reform, where it is needed, should focus on: urgent extension of the protection of workers in atypical forms of employment; grouping atypical contracts together for the purpose of simplification; the sustainable creation of normal employment relationships; clarification of the situation of dependent employment, including preventive action with regard to the health and safety of atypical workers; action against undeclared work; support for the creation of new jobs, including under atypical contracts, and the facilitation of transitions between various types of employment and unemployment, through the promotion of policies such as special employment allowances, lifelong learning, retraining and on-the-job training; encourages steps to clarify the situation of dependent employment, and calls on the Commission to develop clear guidelines on the scope of the employment relationship, as recommended by the ILO in its 2006 Recommendations; 7. Welcomes some Member States’ introduction of provisions to allow employees with care responsibilities to reconcile their responsibilities with their professional obligations by means of more flexible working arrangements; calls on the Commission and Member States actively to support carers in the workplace by providing flexible working conditions, including leave entitlements and flexi-time, part-time and home-working arrangements, which would enable more carers in all Member States to remain in or return to paid employment; 8. Notes the distinction made by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions between atypical and very atypical employment relationships; believes that many forms of atypical employment relationship represent important ways for carers, students and others who rely on short-term contracts and part-time work, for example, to earn extra income; emphasises that it is vital that workers in atypical employment relationships should have minimum rights and be protected against
