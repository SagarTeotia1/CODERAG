WRITTEN QUESTION E-6543/07 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (15 January 2008) Subject: Activation of telephone helplines for children When it adopted the communication ‘Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child’ (COM(2006)0367), the Commission undertook to introduce in the near future a six-digit telephone number (beginning with the number 116) for child helplines and a number for child hotlines dedicated to missing or sexually exploited children. In February 2007, the Commission adopted Decision 2007/116/EC OJ L 49, 17.12.2007, p. 30 . calling on the Member States to reserve the national numbering range beginning with ‘116’ for numbers dedicated to services of social value. The same decision stipulated that the number 116000 should be reserved for a European hotline for missing children and asked Member States to adopt the necessary measures from 31 August 2007 to ensure that this number is assigned. Subsequently, the Commission launched a public consultation to ascertain what other services of social value should have 116 numbers assigned to them, a process which was concluded on 20 May 2007. In October 2007, on the basis of this consultation, the Commission adopted a fresh decision (2007/698/EC OJ L 248, 30.10.2007, p. 31 . ), in which it reserved the number 116111 for a children's helpline. 1. Will the Commission say what progress has been made in activating these telephone lines in the EU Member States? 2. What measures has Italy adopted to implement these decisions? 3. Which authorities are responsible for managing these telephone lines in Italy and the other Member States? 4. Can the Commission provide an overview of the situation?
