ORAL QUESTION H-0110/04 for Question Time at the part-session in March I 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Paulo Casaca to the Council Subject: Application of Regulation (EC) 1954/2003 Article 5 of Regulation (EC) 1954/2003 restricts fishing in the first 100 miles of the Macaronesian EEZs, with effect from 14 November 2003, whereas Article 15 of that regulation extends the restrictions applying throughout the Azores and Madeira EEZs until the date of entry into force of the Commission rules governing the fishing effort or 31 July 2004, whichever is the earlier. No one can seriously dispute that the two articles stand in a complementary and coherent relationship. Does the Council believe that application of these articles is subject to its favourable legal opinion? Does it not consider that it is the task of the Member States and the Commission to enforce the regulations adopted by the Council and that only the proper judicial authorities can declare any individual articles to be void? OJ L 289, 7.11.2003, p. 1.
