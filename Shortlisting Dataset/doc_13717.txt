Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (8 July 2008) The Commission has noted the above incident mentioned by the Honourable Member. The Commission reiterates its attachment to democratic values such as freedom of speech and expression and judges it important that these principles are respected in international institutions as they should certainly be a model for pluralism and respect for media freedom. The Commission is pleased to note that the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) offered an apology to the journalist Ahmad Rafat for the incident. Furthermore, the Commission has received assurances from the FAO that measures were taken to avoid similar incidents taking place in the future.
