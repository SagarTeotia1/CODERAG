Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (19 August 2011) The Commission is promoting recycled materials in products through its criteria for Green Public Procurement (GPP) and the EU Ecolabel. For example, the GPP criteria for copying and graphic paper for office use require the paper to either be recycled or sustainably sourced. Many other product group criteria recommend taking into account the recycled materials content when evaluating the tenders, for example for furniture, textiles, windows, thermal insulation, hard floor coverings, wall panels, road construction and mobile phones. The Commission is currently undertaking a review of GPP criteria, including the question of the use of recycled material in products. The Commission does not intend to intervene in the practical organisation of separate collection and sorting is operated either by private, public or mixed companies depending on the Member States and on the competent local authorities. In the European Union as a whole, recycling is mostly carried out by the private sector.
