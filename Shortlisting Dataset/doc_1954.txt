Reply (27 July 2010) The EU has been closely following the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia, both in relation to individual cases and issues of general concern such as the death penalty, the situation of women and girls and freedom of movement. Despite some encouraging developments in the recent past, the human rights situation generally remains a matter of serious concern. The EU will continue raising its concerns with the Saudi authorities, both bilaterally and in meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council, and through statements.
