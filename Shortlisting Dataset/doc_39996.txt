WRITTEN QUESTION E-2506/05 by Panagiotis Beglitis (PSE) , Stavros Lambrinidis (PSE) and Nikolaos Sifunakis (PSE) to the Commission (12 July 2005) Subject: Ecumenical nature of the Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul and the Halki School of Theology Once again, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Gül, has recently reiterated his country's negative stance concerning the recognition of the ecumenical nature of the Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul. At the same time, both Mr Gül and the Minister without portfolio, Mr Aydin, expressed Turkey's unyielding position on the Halki School of Theology, which essentially prevents the School from re-opening and the Greek minority of Istanbul from exercising their religious rights. In the light of the above and with a view to discussion of the ‘negotiating framework’ set out by the Commission and the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, will the Commission say: 1. what immediate steps it will take to ensure that Turkey respects the European Union's decisions, the Copenhagen political criteria and the Community acquis, 2. why it did not clearly set out these issues in the ‘negotiating framework’ which it submitted to the Council, 3. why it ignored the European Parliament's resolution of 15 December 2004 on this subject, and 4. what messages it is sending to the Turkish side at a time when it is becoming increasingly accepted that the Turkish government is holding back the momentum of the reforms?
