Question for written answer P-001613/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ágnes Hankiss (PPE) (23 February 2011) Subject: The future of the European Police Academy (CEPOL) In recent years, the European Police Academy (CEPOL) has regrettably become known within the EP on account of the irregular operation of its former management. As a result of joint efforts, new managers have been appointed, with perceptible favourable results in the crucial fields as from 2010. Representatives of the Court of Auditors have confirmed the initial results. In order to implement the EU’s Internal Security Strategy and successfully combat terrorism and organised crime, it is essential to have high-quality, many-sided law enforcement training which can harmonise the disparate law enforcement traditions and capabilities of the individual Member States and place them in a common framework. Under its new management, CEPOL can properly and effectively perform this important task if it is itself allowed to determine the direction of its future development and there is no threat to its operational independence. 1. Is the Commission planning to amend the legal framework for CEPOL? 2. Is the Commission planning to develop CEPOL in a more integrated manner, contributing more effectively to the implementation of the EU’s Internal Security Strategy? 3. What support will the Commission provide to enable CEPOL to fully implement the administrative action plan (Multiannual Plan 2010‑14) drawn up at the request of the European Parliament?
