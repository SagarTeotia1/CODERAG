Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (17 December 2010) The European Digital Agenda Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions A Digital Agenda for Europe (COM(2010)245 final/2). has launched an ambitious programme for copyright reform. Forthcoming legislative initiatives will concern the issue of making available online a variety of library and archive materials and will focus on instances where prior permission from the relevant rightholders cannot be obtained — so‑called orphan works. Another area of urgent reform is the collective management of copyright. The Commission is preparing a proposal aiming to reform the current situation in order to allow for easier collective multi-territorial licensing of rights. Finally, the Commission is analysing the situation with respect to audiovisual media productions in order to address the opportunities and challenges of online distribution of audiovisual works and is seeking ways to improve the rapid introduction of video-on-demand services across Europe.
