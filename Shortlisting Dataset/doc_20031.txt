the depth of the crisis. The Commission has adopted on the 3 March 2010 a ‘European Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’. The ‘EU 2020 Strategy’ recognises the need for strong policy coordination in the EU, including in the fiscal domain. Tax policies are most effective if they are used within a clear EU framework designed to ensure that Member States do not undermine each others' policies by introducing inconsistent or incompatible measures. Tax developments are carefully and constantly monitored by the European Commission to ensure that the process of tax competition is not damaging to public finances or detrimental to legitimate redistribution and equity concerns. The Commission, together with Member States, will continue its work to promote good governance in the tax area, i.e. transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition.
