WRITTEN QUESTION E-4196/06 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 October 2006) Subject: Delayed flight arrivals and departures Investigations carried out in September by the Association of European Airlines (AEA), to which 31 major airlines belong, have revealed that, despite the measures taken and the introduction of EU penalties, including passenger compensation arrangements, flight arrivals and departures are still affected by delays in most European airports, including Madrid, London, Barcelona, Rome, Athens, Paris, etc., where 26 % of departures are delayed by an average of 38 minutes while 25 % of arrivals are delayed by an average of between 39 and 40 minutes. Does the Commission intend to take additional measures to establish to what extent responsibility for this lies with the airports, the airlines or elsewhere? What facilities are being offered to delayed passengers and what forms of redress must be available to those very probably prevented by missed flights from keeping important business appointments?
