efficient public spending. Price stability and inflation targeting MEPs in the committee say wage moderation should not be seen as the exclusive way to achieve price stability – in fact, real wages should rise in line with productivity levels. They strongly back the independence of the European Central Bank. When it comes to its definition of price stability, MEPs suggest the ECB should move towards a direct inflation targeting regime, where a point inflation target is supplemented by a range of permitted fluctuations around the target rate – this would be similar to the targets set for the Bank of England in Britain. This should not, say MEPs, preclude focussing on the dynamics of monetary aggregates in order to avoid new asset bubbles. The committee is calling for the EU to play a leading role in international efforts to reform regulatory system for financial markets. Euro area enlargement MEPs in the committee stress the need for equal treatment for euro Member States and those seeking to join. They also insist that joining the euro requires full adherence to all the Maastricht criteria. They argue that the Commission should Commission should undertake intensive information campaign in new MS to prepare citizens for euro. Governance and international representation of the euro area The committee says it regrets the lack of progress in improving euro area international representation and that ultimately, the area should have single seat in international financial institutions. In the meantime, the MEPs encourage the idea that common EU positions could be represented by Eurogroup chair, Commission and ECB President in international bodies. The report identifies a wide range of areas where the economic governance of the euro area could be improved. Among the proposals are the idea that the Eurogroup should have formations consisting of competitiveness, environment, employment and education ministers as well as the current Eurogroup of finance ministers. MEPs in the committee want to see a world monetary conference for global consultations – and perhaps also a monetary dispute settlement mechanism under the IMF.

Other amendments set out when can travellers have access to duty free shops, and whether there should there be guidelines for the amount of alcohol and tobacco citizens can take across borders. The full Parliament will now debate and vote on the issue, based on a report by Astrid Lulling (EPP-ED, LU). Duty free shopping in regional airports The Commission’s
