as possible and at the latest within six months of the date upon which it is published in the Official Journal of the European Union . Amendment 8 - Form With reference to the standard forms proposed by the Commission, the rapporteur considers - as the Council has already agreed - that Form A (intended to be used by the requesting Member State in order to issue a request) and Form B (intended to be used by the requested Member State in order to reply to the request) should for practical reasons be combined into one. However, he considers it essential that, in the part containing the information relating to the requesting Member State, 'Contact person' be replaced by the more impersonal 'Contact office'. Provision should obviously be made for particularly delicate, complex investigations in which the identity of the magistrates conducting them needs to be kept confidential in the interests of their safety.
