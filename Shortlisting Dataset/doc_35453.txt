Question for written answer E-001599/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Elisabetta Gardini (PPE) (9 February 2012) Subject: Internet safety A recent survey financed by the European Union and coordinated by the London School of Economics and Political Science has looked into the relationship of more than 25 000 children (and their parents), in 25 different EU Member States, with the Internet. The study highlights several risks, ranging from pornography and bullying on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to ‘sexting’ (sending sexually-themed text messages) and meeting strangers online (which, on several occasions, has resulted in tragedy). Considering that in the EU as many as 49 % of children between the ages of 9 and 16 use the Internet without their parents’ supervision (with peaks of 62 % in countries such as Italy), can the Commission say: 1. whether any action is being planned (such as the allocation of specific funds) to bridge the digital literacy gap affecting older generations, with the aim of enabling them to be more aware of the risks to which their children are exposed on the Internet; 2. whether it is planning any measures to ensure that the installation of ‘dynamic filters’ for differentiated Internet use becomes compulsory in public places, as, for example, is already the case in schools and libraries in the US?
