WRITTEN QUESTION P-4356/06 by Renate Sommer (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 October 2006) Subject: Ilısu reservoir on the Tigris Turkey began construction of the Ilısu reservoir on 5 August 2006. The proposed hydro-electric power station on the River Tigris is part of the Turkish South Anatolia Project, in which 22 reservoirs are planned for the region. After an initial launch failed in 2002 following international protests, the project was relaunched in 2005. Over an area of more than 200 km2, about 200 settlements are to be flooded in what is a politically highly sensitive region. Between 50000 and 80000 people would as a result lose some or all of their present livelihoods. In this connection the planned inundation of the historic city of Hasankeyf is also regrettable as it is of high symbolic value to the local population. Can the Commission say whether it regards the rights of the Kurdish minorities as being threatened by this reservoir project? Apart from the social, ecological and cultural problems, the reservoir project also raises geopolitical questions: all such projects in south-eastern Turky have a direct impact on the water supply of the neighbouring countries of Iraq and Syria. Use has already repeatedly been made of the opportunity to reduce the water supply of the neighbouring countries (in the Gulf War). Can the Commission say what steps it is taking to induce Turkey to sign international legal conventions for projects on transboundary watercourses?
