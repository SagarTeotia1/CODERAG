Question for written answer E-004815/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (17 May 2011) Subject: Private prisons Private prisons operate in the USA, with a turnover of over USD 5 billion. These private prisons, which exist alongside federal prisons, host some 10 % of US prisoners and charge the state USD 90 to 100 per day per prisoner. Private prisons are often accused of being geared towards profit rather than punishment, as they ‘choose’ the prisoners they accept depending on the crimes committed and their state of health, so as not to suffer financial loss. Furthermore, there have been cases of conflicts of interest. — Are there private prisons in the Member States? If so, how is it ensured that they operate transparently and in parallel to public prisons? What problems have occurred? — Given the problems many countries have with the overcrowding of public prisons, does the Commission consider the establishment of private prisons to be an option?
