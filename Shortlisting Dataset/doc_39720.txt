WRITTEN QUESTION P-6152/09 by Luís Paulo Alves (S&D) to the Commission (7 December 2009) Subject: 2008/2009 budget review The latest published version of the draft budget review document contains proposals seemingly at odds with the goal of territorial cohesion, as defined in the strategy charted in the Treaty of Lisbon. The abovementioned communication denotes a shift in the EU’s priorities, entailing swingeing restrictions on regional and agricultural policy, both mainstays of territorial cohesion as provided for in the Treaty. Does not the Commission consider that the EU needs to have a strong agricultural policy and a strong regional policy in order to achieve its territorial cohesion aims? If so, how does it reconcile the ideas expressed in the communication with territorial cohesion?
