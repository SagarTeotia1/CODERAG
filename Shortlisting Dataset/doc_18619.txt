is concerned that the draft IFRS for SMEs refer to using the lower of historical cost or fair value approach which implies a double calculation; 12. Regrets that the draft IFRS for SMEs do not take adequate account of the fact that the addressees of SMEs' accounts are mainly personal shareholders, creditors, business partners and employees rather than anonymous investors as in the case of public companies, and that the addressees of SMEs' accounts are interested in a long-term business relationship rather than a short-term investment; 13. Emphasises that the draft IFRS for SMEs should refrain from making references to the IFRS for public companies, since SMEs having a very limited workforce cannot handle the huge IFRS compendium; 14. Acknowledges, however that there is an overall need for simplification of accounting and auditing measures for SMEs, while recalling that SMEs are creators of jobs and a motor of economic growth; 15. Believes that there should be an open debate about accountancy standards; to this end, believes that the IASB should strengthen its due process as regards stakeholders so that the views of all IFRS users and investors are taken into account; 16. In the light of the foregoing, encourages the Commission to continue its activities with regard to the simplification of company law, accounting and auditing for SMEs via the relevant legislative acts, in particular the Fourth Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (OJ L 222, 14.8.1978, p. 11). Directive as last amended by Directive 2006/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 224, 16.8.2006, p. 1). and Seventh Seventh Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 on consolidated accounts (OJ L 193, 18.7.1983, p. 1). Directive as last amended by Directive 2006/99/EC (OJ L 363, 20.12.2006, p. 137). Company Law Directives. 17. Asserts that any SME standard must be simple and flexible, avoid a one-size-fits-all model and should apply only to SMEs that are active on a cross-border basis; 18. Expresses concern, while supporting the IASB's intention to improve existing standards, that making continual adjustments, and even small changes, can be costly and result in expensive changes for large companies; believes that any changes should only happen when deemed necessary following a cost-benefit analysis.
