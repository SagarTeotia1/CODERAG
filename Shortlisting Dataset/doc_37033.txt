in Luxembourg (Remerschen, Wellenstein and Remich). 1. Situation report by the authorities: Following the 2004 report mentioned by the Honourable Member, a further report has been published in 2006. It is available at http://www.saarland.de/ministerium_umwelt.htm. This report concludes as per 2006 that in their large majority the obligations due by 2005 have been complied with, but it also admits that there are gaps where construction has not yet been finalised. 1. Conclusions by the Commission 4.1. The Commission wishes to recall that the term used in the German version of Directive 91/271/EEC (‘Gemeinde’) might lead to misinterpretation, as this term is as a rule used for a political-administrative entity which might have several settlement areas Legal definition in Article 2(4) of Directive 91/271/EEC: ‘… an area where the population and/or economic activities are sufficiently concentrated for urban waste water to be collected and conducted to an urban waste water treatment plant or to a final discharge point’. . 4.2. The Commission has comprehensively scrutinised implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC in 15 Member States for the environmental objectives due by 1998 and 2000, and has published its report to Parliament and the Council Commission report SEC(2007)363 of 22 March 2007, http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/implrep2007/index_en.htm . Germany has fully complied with its obligations on waste water collection and treatment due by 1998 and 2000. The latest situation report under Article 16 of the directive has been published by the Saarland authorities in 2006; such reports have to be published every two years. Following the compliance assessment for the obligations due by 1998 and 2000, the Commission is currently assessing both compliance with the environmental objectives due by 2005 (agglomerations between 2 000 and 15 000 p.e.), and operational performance of waste water treatment plants. The necessary data have been requested from all Member States in electronic format, and the data inter alia received from Germany are currently scrutinised. 4.3. As for the settlement areas in Saarland addressed by the Honourable Member, available information leads to the conclusions that Directive 91/271/EEC appears to have been adequately implemented for all settlement areas above 2 000 inhabitants or p.e. (population equivalents), and that in a significant number of small villages currently below the scope of Directive 91/271/EEC, biological waste water treatment has been ensured, either by individual plants for villages, or by connection to a joint plant serving several settlement areas. Further waste water collection and treatment for villages is planned or under construction. In case the ongoing scrutiny of data and information will reveal possible breaches with Directive 91/271/EEC, the Commission will — as in comparable cases — take the necessary steps including, where appropriate, commencing infringement procedures.
