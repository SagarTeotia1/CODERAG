Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (23 February 2011) The new loans for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) were put in place shortly before the informal Ecofin Council of Nice in September 2008, which requested the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group to increase its support for SMEs to EUR 30 billion between 2008 and 2011 (including frontloading of EUR 15 billion in 2008 and 2009) as a response to the crisis. The EIB responded positively to that request, signing credit lines dedicated to SMEs for an amount of EUR 20.8 billion in 2008/2009. In 2010, some EUR 10 billion of such operations were signed. The EIB is therefore one year early in achieving the targets set out by the Ecofin Council, effectively addressing the liquidity needs in the market and enhancing SME finance. As for companies benefiting from EIB credit lines, according to the EIB, some 60 000 SMEs have received EIB-supported loans in 2010, which was the best year ever in terms of SME reach, with a total of EUR 24 billion allocated to SMEs during the period 2008‑10. This shows that the new SME product developed by the EIB allowed it to respond rapidly to the call from the Council in order to contribute to mitigating the impact of the financial crisis on European SMEs. The EIB is committed to monitor closely and ensure the effective use of its credit lines by commercial banks for SME lending.
