Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (5 October 2011) Since 2002 the ProEUR Invest Programme has provided African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries a variety of technical assistance projects aimed at reinforcing institutional capacities. The variety of support has enabled the programme to build up a stock of activities which involved several types of management within intermediary organisations such as definition of mandate, planning, economic intelligence, communication, together with other sector-related interventions in agro-industry, trade, tourism and services to support the key intermediary organisations to grow and to generate wealth and employment. Before the programme comes to an end it has been decided to consolidate the success stories in the form of ‘thematic best practices’ to ensure sustainability and consolidation of the results of intermediary organisations' technical assistance projects in the ACP countries. The programme came to an end on 30 September 2011 and, in its final months, three different projects were carried out in order to collect, analyse, process and disseminate ProEUR Invest thematic best practices in three different geographic areas. Three capitalisation workshops also took place at the end of September 2011 in Brussels with the objective to present and share the best practices of the programme. All best practices selected in the three projects will be made available to all stakeholders and shared through the ProEUR Invest electronic platform COM4DEV, which was created to ensure the programme's future existence and continued development.
