a priority; calls on the Mediterranean partners to improve border management and controls and to discharge their responsibilities as regards readmission, and on the EU to provide countries of origin and transit with the necessary technical and financial assistance; 10. Calls for the Euromed partnership to be geared to implementing a policy of economic openness and internal liberalisation in the partner countries, together with a sustainable endogenous development policy aimed at creating a productive social fabric and infrastructure geared to the needs of Mediterranean countries and ensuring that project priorities reflect the shared objectives and priorities of the European Union and the Mediterranean partners and not just economic criteria based on the dictates of an export-geared economy; 11. Maintains that civil society should be given a central role in the partnership and calls for the implementation of policies aimed at creating a rich social fabric that will help prevent people being forced to leave their countries of origin, since they should be able freely to choose whether to emigrate or to stay; 12. Condemns all activities linked to drug trafficking and the exploitation of prostitution and child labour and calls for the fight to be stepped up; calls for the social rights of workers to be guaranteed in these countries through the use of the programmes and resources available as part of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership; 13. Calls for the section of the European Investment Bank dealing with the Mediterranean and the Middle East to be expanded into a fully-fledged branch capable of meeting the objectives laid down in the new strategy, with financial assistance from other Mediterranean countries; 14. Calls on the Council to ensure that the Valencia Ministerial Conference decisions on the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean Foundation to promote further dialogue between cultures and civilisations are acted upon, that an operational decision is taken thereon at the Naples Ministerial Conference and that the requisite financial resources are allocated to the foundation; 15. Reaffirms the need to encourage the further spread of the South-South cooperation process along the lines of the Agadir agreement, since this is the only means of building a genuine free-trade area; draws attention, in this connection, to the important role played by cross-border projects in enhancing and stepping up regional cooperation; 16. Hopes that, thanks to the streamlining of procedures, the new MEDA regulation will enhance the effectiveness of projects, decentralise to a greater extent, improve and step up spending and provide more vigorous and appropriate support for the regional and South-South dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership; calls on the Commission to verify, at the appropriate time, whether the revision has met real needs; 17. Calls for the ratification of association agreements signed between Mediterranean countries and the European Union to be speeded up, and urges that the agreement with Syria be concluded at the earliest opportunity; reiterates the wish of the national parliaments and the European Parliament to be fully involved in the formulation of objectives and the assessment of such agreements; 18. Insists that Libya and Mauritania should take a full part in the Barcelona Process
