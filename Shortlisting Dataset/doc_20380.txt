WRITTEN QUESTION E-5313/08 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (2 October 2008) Subject: Creation of a ‘European credit card’ 1. In the context of the plan to create a ‘Single Euro Payments Area’ (SEPA), does the Commission support and actively promote the creation of a ‘European credit card’ in order to give European consumers a serious alternative, given the oligopolistic conditions which have been created on the world market in credit card payment systems? 2. Will the Commission propose, in the near future, regulatory provisions to create the necessary legal certainty for such a project? 3. What are its views on the banks' proposal that the European initiative in question should adopt the existing system of multilateral interchange fees (MIFs), even on a temporary basis? 4. In the Commission's view, what will be the short-term and long-term benefits to European consumers? What is its response to criticism from market operators that the EU should aim to make further use of cheap electronic money rather than creating a new credit card payments system?
