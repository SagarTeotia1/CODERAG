Question for written answer E-001601/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (9 February 2012) Subject: Reduction in the supply of Russian gas and security of supply Following the exceptional wave of bad weather gripping Europe, supplies of gas from Russia have fallen below normal levels. The Italian authorities and gas suppliers have indicated that if this continues, they will be forced to cut the supply of gas to companies in order to meet total national demand. This situation serves to highlight the longstanding issue of energy supply security in Europe, since the problem today, as in the past, concerns not only Italy but also other Member States such as Germany and Romania. Given that, overall, Europe imports most of the gas it requires for energy production and in view of the strategic importance of the security of energy supplies, how does the Commission intend to guarantee the other EU Member States more secure gas supplies from third countries? Does it intend to begin negotiations with third countries supplying energy to ensure that, in future, exceptionally bad weather conditions or other causes (as in the case of the political and diplomatic dispute between Ukraine and Russia that caused interruptions and irregularities in the Russian gas supplies to Europe) do not throw entire countries into a crisis and do not impede the flow of gas required to satisfy national or European energy demand? Can it say if such agreements exist today between the EU and the major gas-supplying third countries?
