Joint answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-2651/09 , E-2859/09 (26 May 2009) The Honourable Member expressed concerns as to the effects of some of the elements of the restructuring plan of TV2 Denmark A/S which were announced by the Kingdom of Denmark. The Commission can confirm that its services are in the process of analysing the notification submitted by Denmark. However, the Commission cannot comment on the position it might have taken if a different plan had been submitted by Denmark. Although the Honourable Member may appreciate that the Commission cannot comment on the specific elements of an ongoing case, she can rest assured that the Commission will thoroughly examine all elements of the notified restructuring plan.
