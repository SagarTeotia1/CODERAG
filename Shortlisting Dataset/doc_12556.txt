Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (15 June 2011) The Commission is aware of the judgment delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 28 April 2011 in Case C‑61/11 PPU ( El Dridi ). The logic developed by the European Court of Justice in this judgment may have repercussions on all those Member States which have legislation in force which is comparable to the contested national rules which subject to this judgment. It is up to each Member State to assess the consequences of this judgment and to draw the necessary conclusions. The Commission is regularly discussing questions of interpretation and application of the Return Directive 2008/115/EC with Member States' experts and has drawn their attention to Judgment C‑61/11. The deadline for the transposition of the Return Directive recently expired On 24 December 2010. and its full impact will become apparent in the coming months and years. A first report on its application is due by 24 December 2013. It would be premature to propose an amendment of the directive before the adoption of this first Evaluation Report.
