especially with the US, China, India and Japan; notes that a similar dialogue between key consumer and producer countries has also become necessary in order to develop a global approach to energy; believes that these new forms of global energy dialogue should aim at making global energy markets stable, secure and transparent, and at the same time provide a continued boost in support for clean energy sources and energy efficiency; 54. Calls on the Commission and Council to promote an internationally recognised mediation system for conflicts and disputes concerning the delivery and distribution of energy; believes that the EU could initiate such a process by developing a mediation system as part of its neighbourhood policy and also with other key supplier countries, as well as by actively promoting this mediation system globally; takes the view that the EU should therefore develop a model approach to the international management of energy distribution; 55. Welcomes the draft Energy Community Treaty as an essential contribution to the stabilisation of South-East Europe, to the openness of energy markets and to the security of transit routes in Europe; calls for the gradual extension of the Energy Community to encompass Norway and Turkey and all countries involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy; Making energy policy environmentally sound 56. Stresses that the need to change the current energy production mix is not a burden but an opportunity; the use of solar, wind, biomass, hydro or geothermal energy and more energy-efficient technologies will help to fulfil the commitments made in Kyoto and under the UN Framework Climate Change Convention and also strengthen innovation, job creation and competitiveness in Europe; 57. Supports, therefore, the efforts to develop renewable energy sources with a view to securing a sustainable supply of energy; welcomes the steady growth of this sector and its positive impact on jobs; sees major potential for exports of renewable energy production plants to third countries; 58. Urges the 2007 Spring European Council to endorse the action plan proposed by the Commission, which should at least contain the following elements: consumers, whether they are households or commercial and industrial users, should be placed at the centre of energy policy; a road map at Council and Commission level for reaching a target for renewables of 50% by 2040, a 30% reduction at EU level in the CO2 target for 2020 and a 60-80% reduction for 2050; a reform of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to guide the market into investment in a low carbon economy, which should be driven by a set target for EU carbon emissions by 2020, including a target of 25% of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and a binding target for car emissions, a step change in energy efficiency, faster implementation of existing EC rules in the Member States, or failing that, concrete improvements in the regulatory framework, a clearer separation of energy production from energy distribution through stronger independent regulatory control which considers the interests of Europe as a whole, an effort to address missing interconnections, stimulate investment and innovation, minimum binding guidelines set out
