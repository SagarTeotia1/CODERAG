WRITTEN QUESTION E-3065/05 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) to the Commission (1 September 2005) Subject: Overfishing Although, in recent years, the common fisheries policy (CFP) has been reformed, serious criticism is still being levelled at it. Total allowable catches (TACs) of a number of species are still considerably higher than the ecologically responsible level recommended by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). An article in the magazine ‘Fishing in Europe’, published by the Fisheries DG, includes the following sentence: ‘The scientists’ conclusions are indisputable: Fishing activity is taking so many fish that stocks cannot be replenished’. In his book entitled ‘The End of the Line’, a British journalist, Charles Clover, draws the attention of the European Union to the fact that a large number of the major European fish stocks, including cod, hake, place and sole, have already exceeded the ecological safety limit. The reason for this is, firstly, TACs which are too generous and, secondly, illegal catches (which account for up to 60 %). 1. Does the Commission agree with the assessment that the TACs for cod, hake, place and sole are ecologically irresponsible? 2. Has the Commission any intention of proposing that new fish reserves be created in European waters? 3. Is 60 % a realistic estimate of illegal catches? If not, what is the Commission's own estimate, and on what does it base that estimate? 4. Is the Commission prepared to investigate ways of encouraging consumers to eat only sustainable fish species (such as MSC-certificated fish)? 5. Does the Commission see any possibility of the CFP being further reformed so that the landing and import and/or processing of non-sustainable fish species is either prohibited or strongly discouraged?
