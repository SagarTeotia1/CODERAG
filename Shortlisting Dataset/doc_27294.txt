Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2011) 1. Regulation 1946/2003 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:287:0001:0010:EN:PDF provides that exports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) intended for deliberate release into the environment should be notified to the competent authority of the Party or non-Party of import to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB), allowing it to make an informed decision, based on a risk assessment carried out in a scientifically sound manner. The exporter is responsible for making this notification and for the accuracy of the information that it contains. In addition, it has to send a copy of the notification, the acknowledgement of receipt and the decision of the importing country to the competent authority of the Member States from which the GMO is exported and to the Commission. In the case enquired by the Honourable Member, the exporter, Oxitec, notified the shipment of genetically modified mosquito eggs to Grand Cayman Island as exports of GMOs under Regulation 1946/2003 given that their intended use was for deliberate release. Accordingly, and in line with the requirements of Article 4 of Regulation 1946/2003, prior to the first transboundary movement to the Cayman Islands, Oxitec made a notification with the information required in Annex I of Regulation 1946/2003, which includes a risk assessment report consistent with Annex II of Directive 2001/18/EC http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:106:0001:0038:EN:PDF . Before proceeding with the shipment, Oxitec awaited the consent of the Government of the Cayman Islands, which issued an import permit in August 2009. 2. The United Kingdom Competent Authority has recently forwarded the relevant information from the exporter to the Commission, which will make these documents available to the public in accordance with the European Union rules on access to environmental information.
