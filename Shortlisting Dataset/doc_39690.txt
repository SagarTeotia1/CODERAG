economic, social, cultural or collective rights, must be clearly enshrined in the objectives of this new initiative, in particular through the strengthening of existing mechanisms; underlines, in this regard, the importance of respecting the freedoms of expression, thought and religion, in addition to the need to ensure the protection of minorities, including religious minorities; stresses that women's rights, gender equality and the fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation require particular attention; reiterates its support for democratic political organisations and civil society on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and pays tribute to the valuable work done by women's organisations; 4. Takes the view that political tensions and regional conflicts in the Mediterranean basin must not hinder tangible progress towards multilateral cooperation in specific sectors, and that it is through the implementation of major integration projects and open political dialogue that the UfM will help to develop a climate of trust conducive to pursuing common justice and security goals in a spirit of solidarity and peace; stresses, however, that the UfM will not be fully successful unless the various regional conflicts are settled, in accordance with international law, making the Mediterranean a single shore of peace; 5. Stresses the urgency of achieving a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East and calls for the firm commitment in this regard of the EU and of all UfM member countries; reiterates its call for the immediate resumption of meaningful negotiations in the context of the peace process, with a view to achieving a two-State solution – an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State and the State of Israel, living side by side in peace and security and with internationally recognised borders; encourages the important contribution that the UfM can make to the improvement of relations between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, also thanks to the cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian representatives within it; 6. Welcomes the appointment of the Secretary General and the adoption of the statute of the secretariat and recommends that, in preparation for the Barcelona Summit, the UfM’s institutional and operational structure be completed by taking the following steps: – providing the secretariat with the necessary resources, both financial and statutory, to operate effectively and independently; stressing the urgency of making the secretariat fully operational and the need for its staff to be selected on the basis of merit, with due attention to the principles of geographical distribution and gender equality; – clarifying the criteria for approving, funding and implementing major projects and specifically setting the priorities for the next 3 years; – ensuring joint representation of EU participants (Member States, the Council and the Commission) in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, while at the same time fostering active participation by all Mediterranean third countries; – ensuring the democratic legitimacy of the UfM by confirming the EMPA as an integral part of the institutional structure; – stepping up coordination with EU projects and programmes approved by the specialised ministerial conferences, with a particular focus on possible synergies; – allowing ‘variable-geometry’ cooperation arrangements open to countries
