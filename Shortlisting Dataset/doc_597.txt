Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (22 February 2011) The Commission is supporting the Egyptian authorities to combat human trafficking in the context of a EUR 10 million EU‑funded programme on Justice Modernisation and Enhancement of Security. One component of this programme will support the fight against trafficking in human beings following the approval of a new anti-human trafficking law of 7 March 2010. The anti-human trafficking component will focus on several areas. Firstly, it will support the drafting of the National Strategy to prevent human trafficking which is currently being prepared. Secondly, it will assess existing capacity and help to define and implement a mechanism for identifying, assisting and protecting the victims of human trafficking. Finally, it will support awareness-raising of the issue among the public through media campaigns as well as a hot-line service to support victims. Moreover, in the framework of the Thematic Programme for cooperation with Third Countries in the areas of Migration and Asylum, the Commission is currently financing various projects implemented by International Organisations and non-governmental organisations aiming at fighting human trafficking beings in Egypt and in its neighbouring countries, as well as one project providing alternatives to irregular migration for unaccompanied children in Egypt, The Commission also refers the Honourable Member to its answer to his Written Question E‑10879/10 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp .
