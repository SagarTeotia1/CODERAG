Question for written answer E-001849/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Teixeira (PPE) (15 February 2012) Subject: New carbon tax to be implemented by the Commission The Commission has adopted a new directive aimed at environmental protection and introducing a carbon tax, which came into force on 1 January 2012. For example, Europe envisages that all airlines will pay the equivalent of 15 % of the cost of their CO 2 emissions (around 32 million tonnes) to combat global warming. On 6 February 2012, the United States Congress condemned the European legislation on carbon emissions from aircraft and called on the US Government to do everything possible to fight the European carbon tax. The Chinese authorities have banned the country’s airlines from paying the taxes on pollutant emissions imposed by the European Union. China, the US, Russia and another 23 of the 36 members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation have rejected the EU’s arguments. The Chief Executive of Airbus, Tom Enders, has said he is ‘really worried’ about the consequences of levying a carbon tax on the airlines operating in the European Union. In Portugal, the adoption of this directive in the refinery sector will involve an annual investment of EUR 40 million in the refineries of Sines and Matosinhos. In view of the above, the Commission is asked to answer the following: 1. Does it consider it appropriate to keep the carbon tax in place when those hit hardest will be European companies? 2. Does it not believe that the carbon tax will create negative discrimination against European companies compared to their international counterparts, causing Europe to be less competitive? 3. What measures does the Commission plan to adopt in future to solve this problem?
