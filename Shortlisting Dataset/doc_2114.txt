Amendments by Parliament (Amendment 1 ) Recital 10 Wishing to have a coherent approach at European level and to act effectively against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, the participating States agreed to establish a partnership on clinical trials between European countries and the developing countries in order to obtain a critical mass in terms of human and financial resources and the combination of additional expertise and resources available in various countries across Europe. Wishing to have a coherent approach at European level and to act effectively against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries , the participating States agreed to establish a partnership on clinical trials between European countries and the developing countries in order to obtain a critical mass in terms of human and financial resources and the combination of additional expertise and resources available in various countries across Europe , in view of obtaining products adapted to the local conditions and accessible to local populations. Justification: Conditions of life, and therefore of care and treatment, of people affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria and/or tuberculosis in developing countries radically differ from developed countries for example practical aspects such as keeping drugs refrigerated and taking doses with food may differ. This crucial element needs to be taken into account throughout the R&D process to avoid having an end product that is unusable or unaffordable. (Amendment 2 ) Recital 12 The objective of the EDCTP Programme, the cost of which is estimated by participating States at €600 million over a five year period, is to accelerate the development of new clinical interventions to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the developing countries, particularly in Sub Saharan Africa. The EDCTP Programme has been drawn up with a view to stepping up cooperation and the networking of European national programmes, accelerating clinical trials of new products in the developing countries, helping to strengthen capacities in the developing countries and obtaining additional funds to fight these diseases.
