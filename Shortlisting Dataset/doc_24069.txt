Answer given by Mrs Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (1 June 2011) The EU has contributed more than EUR 102 million — Commission and Member States combined — to assist people fleeing Libya and to repatriate Third Country Nationals to their country of origin. To date the EU has financed EUR 50 million (EUR 40 million from the EU budget's humanitarian aid budget line and EUR10 million from the Civil Protection budget line) while the 27 Member States have collectively contributed EUR 52 million to the Libyan crisis. As of 15 May 2011 the 786 000 people who fled Libya since the beginning of the crisis, 393 000 went to neighbouring Tunisia. This figure includes Tunisians, Libyans and Third Country Nationals. As regards the Third Country Nationals, the main nationalities represented are Egyptians (40 %), Sub-Saharan Africans (28 %) and Bangladeshi (13 %). The Sub-Saharans are mainly composed of Sudanese (10 %), Ghanaians (5 %), Chadians (5 %), Malians (5 %) and from Niger (2 %).The Commission has supported the repatriation of third‑country nationals to their country of origin by funding the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Government of Tunisia has responded swiftly to the influx and in a highly cooperative manner as regards the establishment of camps on the Tunisian border (3 camps at Ras Ajdir; 3 camps in Tataouine, Remada and Dehiba). Migrants also benefit from the effective support of local communities. Finally, it is clear from a survey carried out among Third Country Nationals at the beginning of the crisis that TCNs who have left Libya want to return to their home country. As far as the Commission is aware, only those who are not able to return home are likely to look to alternatives. As of 10 May 2011 12 360 persons having fled Libya had reached the shores of the European Union (Italy and Malta).
