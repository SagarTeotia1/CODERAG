Reply (10 May 2005) The Council has repeatedly and consistently raised the issue of religious freedom with the Chinese authorities, at all levels, and will continue to do so as most recently during the EU-China summit meeting in The Hague. The issue of persecution of Christian churches was raised during the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue of September 2004. The recent arrest of prominent church leader Zhang Rongliang has been raised in diplomatic contacts in Beijing. Similarly, the Council raises concerns with regard to individuals, including persons persecuted on the basis of practising their faith. At its meeting on 11 October 2004, the Council adopted conclusions on the evaluation of the human rights situation in China and the human rights dialogue with China. In this occasion, the Council considered that the overall assessment of developments showed a mixed picture of progress in same areas and continuing concerns in others, which led it to express its concern about continuing violations of human rights such as freedom of religion, no progress having been registered in the respect of the rights of persons belonging to minorities as regards religious freedom.
