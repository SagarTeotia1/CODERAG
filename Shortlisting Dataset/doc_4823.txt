Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (15 September 2008) The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that, according to Articles 22 and 23 of Council Directive 2000/29/EC Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and their spread within the Community, OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, as last amended by Commission Directive 2008/64/EC of 27 June 2008, OJ L 168, 28.6.2008. , a plant health financial contribution has been granted several times to Portugal for the control of pinewood nematode. This financial contribution was first given for a total amount of EUR 1.9 million for expenditure incurred by Portugal between 1999 and 2003. In the light of the evolution of the situation of the disease in Portugal, an additional contribution of EUR 6.5 million was granted by Commission Decision 2006/923/EC Commission decision of 13 December 2006 on a Community financial contribution for 2006 and 2007 to cover expenditure incurred by Portugal for the purpose of combating Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (pinewood nematode), OJ L 354, 14.12.2006. for the creation of a zone free of the host trees of the disease (a so-called clear cut belt). These plant health contributions intend to co-finance the expenditure made from public funds to cover the various actions taken by a Member State to control harmful organisms i.e. necessary treatments like destruction or disinfection, inspections or testing for the presence of the harmful organism, and prohibitions or restrictions of use of substrates or cultivable areas. In particular in the case of the payment of EUR 6.5 million under Commission Decision 2006/923/EC, EUR 2 million were destined for the compensation of the owners of the pine trees which were felled to create the clear cut belt.
