Gleneagles in July 2005 on a comprehensive financial and economic plan to support the progress for Africa, where most of extreme poverty is concentrated, and in particular the decision taken to cancel completely the remaining debts of heavily indebted poor countries to the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Fund as a way of meeting the MDGs; emphasises that this initiative must be extended to those developing countries which have demonstrated practically that they are working to reduce corruption, increase transparency and utilise the resources released by the cancellation of debt on strategies for poverty reduction; 12. Welcomes the willingness expressed by Commissioner Mandelson in his statement of 9 February 2006 in Mauritius to adopt a differentiated approach to poor countries based on their level of development and to maintain a tariff preferences system that takes account of these disparities; 13. Welcomes the fact that trade relations between the European Union and the poor countries are asymmetrical, to the benefit of the latter; believes that relations of this kind should serve as a basis for regulating trade at global level; calls on the Commission to argue within the WTO for the introduction of several separate coefficients so as to calculate reductions in customs duties in accordance with the situation of the group of countries concerned; 14. Calls on the Commission to support a consistent tariff policy that will make it possible to differentiate trade policy, so as to meet the expectations of the most fragile countries; with this in view, urges it that a reasonable level of general customs protection be maintained, so as to preserve the comparative advantages enjoyed by these countries under the generalised system of preferences (GSP) which enables them to have sufficient resources available to modernise their production structures; 15. Recalls the EU commitment, under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, to promote sustainable development and poverty eradication in the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP); and considers that the EU, as an important trade player in the multilateral institutions, could contribute to the reinforcement of the developing countries’ position by shaping a more coherent and comprehensive policy, in accordance with Article 178 of the EC Treaty; stresses, however, the significant input of other international donors; 16. Stresses the importance of debt relief by phasing out the debts of LDCs for those governments which respect human rights and the principle of good governance, and give priority to poverty eradication and economic development; 17. Calls on the EU take the lead in order to develop and help to implement schemes to end the debt burden in order to meet the MDGs; 18. Notes that, according to UNCTAD, in 2004 the 50 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) – more than one third of ACP countries - accounted for over 11% of the world’s population (742 million), but only 0.6% of the world’s GDP; 19. Considers that it is crucial to take into account the right to development of the citizens of poor countries, and not merely the interests of those countries’ regimes, and that poor countries must decide and
