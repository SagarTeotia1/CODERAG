9999/C Q999 E/103 WRITTEN QUESTION P-0094/04 by Adriana Poli Bortone (UEN) to the Commission (13 January 2004) Subject: Reform of the COM in tobacco On 18 November 2003 the Commission adopted a series of legislative proposals aimed at reforming the COM in tobacco. The proposals entail dismantling the current COM and gradually eliminating any kind of aid to tobacco production in Europe. Since the elimination of aid will herald the end of tobacco production in Europe and thus the processing industry will have no option but to obtain supplies from abroad, can the Commission say whether it considers that: - the socio-economic problems caused in some areas of the European Union by the progressive abandonment of this crop will be counterbalanced by tangible benefits in terms of combating smoking; - it is illogical to eliminate tobacco production in Europe whilst failing to make provision for any form of protection for imports of tobacco from abroad; - there is any point in eliminating tobacco production in Europe when the consumption of the product continues to be lawful and there is strong demand on the market?
