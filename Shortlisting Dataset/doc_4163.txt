WRITTEN QUESTION E-0565/10 by Frieda Brepoels (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 February 2010) Subject: Positive list for animals For some time, Belgium has had a positive list for mammals. It sets an example to other EU Member States. 1. Does the Commission intend to draw up a positive list for mammals at European level? If so, when and how will this process be organised? If not, why not? 2. Can the Commission provide an overview of the Member States which already have a positive list for mammals? 3. Is the Commission aware of any Member States which also have a positive list for reptiles and/or birds? If so, which? 4. Would it also be possible to draw up a European positive list for reptiles and birds? If so, when and how will this process be organised? If not, why not?
