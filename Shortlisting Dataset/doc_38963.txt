Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (4 August 2003) The different stakeholders involved in promoting the eco-label (Member States, Commission, competent bodies and interest groups) place considerable emphasis on marketing and promotion and have set up a marketing management group to co-ordinate promotion activities. An awareness raising campaign planned for 2004 will contribute to the visibility of the scheme. As already mentioned in the answer to the Honourable Member's Written Question E-2241/02 OJ C 309 E, 12.12.2002 . , views differ on the question of fees. The Commission had carried out a consultation with stakeholders in preparing the recent revision of the Decision establishing the Eco-label fees and proposed a structure consisting of an application and an annual fee. Test and verification costs are not included in those fees. The Commission does not intend to further revise this fee structure. However, the Commission has started general discussions about the revision of the scheme within the policy group of the European Union Eco-labelling Board to further improve the instrument and the involvement of Member States. As this work is in its initial stage no decisions have been taken so far.
