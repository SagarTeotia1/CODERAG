between all EU Member States beyond surveillance towards pro-active economic policy coordination, including strengthened governance mechanisms to implement the Europe 2020 strategy; regrets, in this respect, that while the Commission has been making wide-reaching proposals to strengthen budgetary surveillance, it has stopped short of proposing sufficiently relevant solutions for restoring and enforcing long term economic growth rates and towards a well targeted economic policy coordination geared towards the development of a common budgetary strategy in the framework of a comprehensive Europe 2020 strategy; 7. Calls, therefore, on the task force created by the European Council in March 2010 to provide concrete proposals on deeper and broader economic coordination; 8. Notes the five headline targets agreed by the European Council on employment rate, conditions for research and development, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving education levels and promoting social inclusion; deplores that these headline targets are not formulated in the framework of a consistent and coherent sustainable development strategy combining the economic, social and environmental policy agendas; 9. Regrets that the European Council conclusions do not take into account that the fragile recovery process now underway must be fully reflected in a new 2020 strategy, by formulating a coherent and encompassing policy agenda which fully integrates the macroeconomic policy stance into this strategy in such a way as to ensure that necessary budgetary consolidation will not undermine the achievement of the strategy, especially with regard to the fight against unemployment, as well as adequate and well coordinated investment in infrastructures and knowledge; is alarmed by the conclusions of the Council of 9 May calling for a strong commitment to accelerated fiscal consolidation, which can endanger the political commitments contained in the Europe 2020 strategy, undermine the path towards strong and fair welfare states, and jeopardize the still fragile recovery process, and may, therefore, lead to an additional loss of several million jobs over the medium term; 10. Stresses that the recent events involving sovereign credit default swaps used by financial speculators and leading to unjustified high levels of several national spreads, have been an urgent reminder of the fact that deficiencies and instabilities in the financial regulatory and supervisory framework have direct negative spill over effects on national economies’ sustainability and on the euro area’s stability; strongly supports the urgent adoption of an enhanced and ambitious European financial supervisory framework providing an adequate regulation and supervision of every financial product, transaction and institution in the EU; underlines that the need for market transparency and enhanced European regulation is a matter not only of efficient market surveillance but also of European sovereignty; 11. Takes note of the headline target on employment rate for men and women; regrets that the quality of employment is not taken into account in this objective; reiterates that high quality employment should be a key priority of a 2020 strategy; calls, therefore, for a new legislative agenda to strengthen workers’ rights and working conditions, including a revision of the posting of workers directive and new or revised directives on minimum income schemes, working time, abusive individual dismissals, information and consultation, union
