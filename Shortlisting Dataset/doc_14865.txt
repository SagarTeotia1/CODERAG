Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (3 November 2011) 1. The Commission has not suspended payments to the 2007‑13 regional programme for Lazio under Article 92 of Council Regulation 1083/2006. By letter of 28 February 2011, however, the Italian authorities were informed that the deadline for the treatment of a payment request introduced at the end of 2010 had been interrupted on the basis of Article 91(1) of the same regulation, on account of evidence suggesting a significant deficiency in the functioning of the management and control system of the programme. Following an exchange of information between the Commission and the Italian authorities, the Commission has concluded that the deficiency detected was satisfactorily addressed. Accordingly, by letter of 16 June 2011 the interruption of the payment deadline was lifted. 2. The Commission is monitoring very closely the work of the audit authority with particular attention to be paid to the Annual Control Report for 2011. On the basis of this report, the risk assessment will be updated and the audit planning for 2012 will be revised accordingly. 3. In total 18 audit missions are planned for the following programmes: Puglia, Sicilia, Sardegna, Calabria, Campania, POI Energie, PON Governance, PON Reti e mobilità and PON Trasporti, covering both the 2000‑06 and 2007‑13 periods.
