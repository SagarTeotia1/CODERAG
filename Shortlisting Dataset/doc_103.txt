Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (8 February 2012) The Commission does not agree with the assertion that the direct payment ‘will primarily benefit farming conglomerates in France and Germany’. The legal proposals on the direct payments foresee a new distribution of direct payments ensuring: — more convergence of direct payments between Member States; (Annex II of the proposal COM(2011) 625 final ‘Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy’. ); — a uniform basic payment per hectare for all farmers and all agricultural land in production and/or providing basic public goods at national/regional level; — the progressive reduction and ultimately capping of direct payments per beneficiary leading to a lower level of unitary support per hectare for the biggest farms; — a specific simplified scheme for small farmers representing up to 10 % of the direct payments which will also improve the redistribution of direct payments between farmers. As regards the environmental performance of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and more generally the sustainability of farm practices, the proposal contributes largely to their improvement. Among numerous measures, the ‘green’ payment representing 30 % of the national envelope of direct payments is the most noticeable: all farmers receiving the basic payment will have to implement compulsory practices beneficial for the environment and the climate such as crop diversification of arable land, maintenance of permanent pasture and setting-up and/or maintenance of ecological focus areas on farmland. In case those practices are not respected by farmers, financial sanctions will apply proportionally going possibly beyond the level of the ‘green’ payment.
