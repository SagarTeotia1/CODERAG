Question for written answer E-007696/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Julie Girling (ECR) (8 August 2011) Subject: UK council tax for European students On 14 March 2011 the Commission published a Reasoned Opinion formally requesting the UK to amend its rules on local real estate taxes for students on the basis that they discriminate against students subject to UK council taxes but studying in another Member State. In its press release, the Commission held that in the absence of a satisfactory response from the Her Majesty’s Government within two months, the Commission may refer the UK to the European Court of Justice. Has the Commission received a response from the UK? If the Commission has received a response, was it satisfactory? If the response was not satisfactory, will the Commission now refer the UK to the European Court of Justice? In short, I would like an indication of the next steps from the Commission.
