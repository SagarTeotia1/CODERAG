9999/C Q999 E/003 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0853/04 by Terence Wynn (PSE) to the Commission (09 March 2004) Subject: New Regulation on sugar export and dispatch from outermost regions I am led to understand that the Commission put to the consideration of the Management Committee for Exchanges on 20 January a proposal for amending Commission regulation (EC) No 20/2002 OJ L 8, 11.1.2002, p. 1 . concerning export and dispatch authorisations from the outermost regions of products included in the POSEI regimes (regimes for the development of local farm products and some food supply). In this a large number of products are considered in the case of Madeira, although Madeira does not have an indigenous sugar production or refinery. However, the Azores, which have an active sugar production and refinery industry, will be forbidden from exporting to the US and Canada (their traditional markets) or dispatching to European ones their local and artisan products using local sugar, like liqueurs, dairy products and marmalades. Would you agree with the previous public declarations of a Member of the European Parliament, who represents the Azores, that there is a continuing attitude by the Commission of bias against the Azorean sugar facilities? Could you confirm if Madeira is normally supplied through branches or associates of British Sugar? Could you confirm that a subsidiary of British Sugar attempted and failed to acquire a controlling interest in the sole sugar producer and refiner of the Azores?
