Question for written answer E-000740/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE) (2 February 2012) Subject: Differentiation of rates of interest and increasing imbalances According to reports on the Bloomberg website on 28.11.2011 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/secret-fed-loans-undisclosed-to-congress-gave-banks-13-billion-in-income.html , the American Central Bank (FED) secretly supplied American banks with USD 1.2 trillion at ‘lower-than-market interest rates’ in December 2008. The website also states that six large banks (JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley), which were given USD 160 billion as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program passed in 2008, borrowed another USD 460 billion from the FED. The report continues: ‘The six banks accounted for 63 percent of the average daily debt to the Fed’. However, another report in the newspaper USA TODAY on 28.11.2011 http://www.usatoday.com/money/world/story/2011-10-27/eurozone-crisis-deal/50963370/1 emphasises that these banks had exposure in bonds of five hyper-indebted European economies (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain) worth USD 52.2 billion but that they had tried to reduce their exposure by buying insurance. In view of this: 1. What does the Commission know about the matter? Does it consider that such actions increase the uncertainties and imbalances in the global economy? 2. What does it think about the fact that financial institutions, while accepting loan capital at very low interest rates, then made loans to European governments at hugely higher rates? 3. To what extent does it believe that the attempt by the above banks to buy insurance affected, and continues to affect, efforts by the hyper-indebted national governments of the EU to ensure the smooth management and servicing of their debts? 4. What measures is it taking to be protected against policies that promote increasing imbalances in the global economic system?
