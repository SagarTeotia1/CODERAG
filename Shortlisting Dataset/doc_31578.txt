WRITTEN QUESTION E-1613/05 by Bernhard Rapkay (PSE) to the Commission (2 May 2005) Subject: Eligibility of equity funds for financing under the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship Through the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship (MAP) and its proposed successor, the competitiveness and innovation framework programme (CIP), the Commission provides support for equity funds that are targeted particularly at small and medium-sized companies and make investments of between EUR 0.2 and 2.5 million. Under these arrangements, certain funds that concentrate precisely on this sector in Germany have to date been excluded from receiving EU funding, since this is dependent on the legal form and ownership structure of the fund and subject to the requirement that at least 50 % of the capital does not come from public sources. Under the draft CIP programme (2007‑13) the Commission now plans to change these rules and treat equity funds as eligible for financing irrespective of their legal form and ownership structure, provided that they operate in accordance with general market rules (‘market economy investor principle’). This makes sense, as it removes administrative obstacles to EU support for equity funding of dynamic and innovative SMEs. In order to enable the benefits of these changes to be experienced by SMEs in the European Union as soon as possible, it is desirable that, in connection with the forthcoming extension of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship up to the end of 2006, the programme guidelines already be adjusted accordingly. Bringing forward these rules and applying them under the multiannual programme would make the latter more effective without needing additional budget resources. For the above reasons, could the Commission introduce measures to enable the planned changes under the CIP programme to the rules on eligibility of equity funds for financing already to take effect under the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship when it is extended up to the end of 2006?
