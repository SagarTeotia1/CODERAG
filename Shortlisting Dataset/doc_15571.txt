support for doing so; (4) Restates its repeatedly made demand that Europol be placed on a Community footing in order both to increase its effectiveness and to step up the democratic and judicial oversight to which it must be subject; (5) Considers that integrated management of the Union’s external borders is one of the objectives currently requiring urgent, and greater, support; accordingly backs the increase in resources made available to the External Borders Fund; (6) Increases the resources made available to the FRONTEX Agency; urges the Polish Government to use its best endeavours to finalise the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding that specifies precisely the legal status of FRONTEX as a Community agency as regards its premises and staff in the Republic of Poland; invites the Polish Government in its capacity as host country to finalise the logistical and financial support for FRONTEX; (7) Points out that the new framework programme entitled ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ is not confined to organisational arrangements for better control of external borders, but pursues the general objective of improving the way in which Member States handle the flows of migrants arriving in their territory and of better integrating those given leave to stay there; resolves, in this connection, to increase the resources made available to the European Refugee Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals by, in both cases, a proportion comparable to the increase in resources for the External Borders Fund; (8) Voices its willingness to bring the new Agency for Fundamental Rights into operation as soon as possible and endorses the appropriations requested by the Commission for this purpose; (9) Voices its profound concern at the unremitting arrivals of migrants in the Mediterranean (Malta, Lampedusa, etc.) and on the Canary Islands and at the competent authorities’ difficulties in coping with that influx in terms of reception arrangements, accommodation capacity, translation needs and health care; proposes therefore, by way of a preparatory action, that a programme entitled REDISO - Reception in dignity and solidarity - be launched with the aim of funding the measures to be taken at the start of 2007 to help the Member States cope with the most urgent requirements prior to actual implementation of the ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ framework programme; this new programme - temporary by definition - ought to be allocated EUR 10 million; (10) Proposes that a pilot project be launched with the aim of supporting the exchange of information and cooperation on urban safety between authorities in Europe’s major urban centres, in particular to prevent and check the spread of juvenile crime, which European citizens are less and less willing to tolerate.
