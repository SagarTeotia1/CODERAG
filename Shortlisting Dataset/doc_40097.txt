WRITTEN QUESTION E-3915/06 by Christofer Fjellner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 September 2006) Subject: Free access to information on medicines The EU and the internal market are based on the principle of freedom of movement for services, goods, people and capital. With the advent of the Internet, the information society became a reality and information now also flows freely across Europe. This development is extremely positive and something which the EU should protect. As regards information concerning medicines, however, the situation is different. In this case, EU rules restrict the information available to patients and the public. In several instances, Member States' restrictions on information concerning medicines are far-reaching and, in Belgium and Italy, for example, pharmaceutical manufacturers are prohibited from informing the public about their medicines over the Internet, with reference to Directive 2001/83/EC OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67 . , despite the fact that they should know most about their products and that medicines are literally a matter of life and death for many European citizens. Does the Commission consider that Directive 2001/83/EC entitles Member States to restrict the public's access to information? Does the Commission consider that EU citizens have a right to information without public authorities' authorising and setting limits on it? When will the Commission propose relevant legislation to put an end to Member States' censure and restrictions of the flow of information concerning medicines to patients and the general public?
