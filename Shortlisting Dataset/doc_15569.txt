19.3 in the PDB 2007. In particular this would affect conferences and seminars but, even if in smaller scale, also twinning schemes support to civil society organisations and projects. As for MEDIA above, the budget would however grow in the coming years. The rapporteur welcomes the strengthening of the cooperation with third countries (USA and Canada) on education and vocational training (15 02 03), where commitments are stepped up to 5.338m in the 2007 PDB. Some of the appropriations for administrative expenditure associated with the programmes in this policy area will be used for the Executive Agency, whose staff would rise to 227 persons for education and culture programmes (plus 83 Media). In total, the budget chapter 15 01 (Administrative expenditure of education and culture policy area) will be 101.802m (compared to 90.915 in 2006). It has to be noticed that this expenditure includes now also the Commission officials working in the Agency. Nevertheless, the administrative costs have to be closely monitored given their relevance on the overall amount of the programmes. It has also to be noticed that the pilot projects on individual mobility of upper-secondary pupils (15 02 02 06) and on Erasmus-style programme for apprentice (15 02 03) are now integrated in LLL, even though with no budget appropriations, pending an evaluation. Policy area 16: The rapporteur underlines that spending in this policy area, even though not specifically under on going co-decision procedures, deserves closer monitoring. In particular, the considerations by the culture and education committee last year on this point seem still valid: "the Commission must offer at least some indication of how the actions supported by these lines will fit together in its new information and communication strategy". The rapporteur believes that the so-called Plan D is still lacking of a clear indication of actions and priorities. It has to be noticed the increase of 12.77% for administrative expenditure (16 01). This would consist of 109.547m for administrative expenditure out of a total of 186.373m for policy area 16. Indeed this has to be explained by the specificity of this sector, which employs a high number of technicians, specialised staff and local staff for representation offices, external staff at headquarters, management expenditure and internal staff. At the same time, it seems quite striking that the Commission's ambition in the "Going local" communication line (16 03) is quite little. This includes PRINCE, for which commitments of 16.261m have been allocated for 2007 (15.549 in 2006) and direct communication measures targeted at opinion multipliers and opening information centres for the public. These reductions have finally to be noticed (commitments): - Line 16 02 02 - multimedia actions: from 15250m (2006 Budget) to 13750m (2007 PDB) - Line16 05 01 - information relays: from 16752m (2006 Budget) to 14554m (2007 PDB). For both lines commitment appropriations of 1m have been put in the reserve in 2006.
