Joint answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission Written questions : P-002993/11 , E-002994/11 (9 June 2011) The EU has swiftly implemented the United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 together with additional measures, notably autonomous designations of persons and entities subject to an asset freeze, including in the oil and gas sector. These designations are intended to prevent the funding of the Gadaffi regime by prohibiting any making available of funds or other economic resources to the listing entities, including the NOC and its subsidiaries. The amounts frozen in the EU are not confiscated. Therefore, under the EU sanctions regimes, those funds can only be released under specific exemptions, notably for the payment of basic expenses of listed persons or for payments due by listed persons and entities under existing contracts. In due course and when conditions on the ground would allow so, the EU would be ready to consider any possible option which would ensure that the revenues from oil and gas benefit the Libyan population, including with the establishment of an escrow account at the level of the UN. This would require a political solution to the current crisis so that an appropriate mechanism in that respect could be established. All parties concerned, including the Arab League, the African Union and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference would have to be involved and play a role in any such mechanism.
