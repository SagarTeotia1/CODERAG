Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (2 December 2003) Over the period 1994-1999 the Community supported the conservation of biological and genetic diversity in agriculture by means of Regulation (EC) No 1467/94 Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/94 of 20 June 1994 on the conservation, characterisation, collection and utilisation of genetic resources in agriculture, OJ L 159, 28.6.1994 . , which launched a Community programme for the conservation, characterisation, collection and utilisation of genetic resources in agriculture. It added value to the action taken in the individual Member States by promoting transnational cooperation. Any natural or legal person who was a national of a Member State and established in the Community could participate. The Regulation enabled 21 projects to be funded, including four on animal genetic resources. No project for the conservation of the Sorraia horse was proposed. Over the same period the Community supported the rearing of animals of local breeds in danger of extinction under Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 of 30 June 1992 on agricultural production methods compatible with the requirements of the protection of the environment and the maintenance of the countryside, OJ L 215, 30.7.1992 . (Article 2). Thirty-five animals of the Sorraia breed benefited from aid in Portugal. Since 2000 the Community has been supporting measures to protect endangered breeds under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations, OJ L 160, 26.6.1999 . (Chapter VI) and its implementing Regulation, Regulation (EC) No 445/2002 Commission Regulation (EC) No 445/2002 of 26 February 2002 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 , OJ L 74, 15.3.2002 . (Article 14). That Article provides that Community support may cover the rearing of farm animals of local breeds indigenous to the area and in danger of being lost to farming . The breeds must meet the criteria for the thresholds under which a breed is considered to be in danger of being lost to farming laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 445/2002 . If the Member States choose to include such measures in their rural development plans (RDPs), aid is granted to farmers who enter into agri-environmental commitments for a minimum period of five years. Also, Regulation (EC) No 445/2002 applies to farm animals registered in the stud-books of approved organisations. The Portuguese authorities have informed the Commission that the Associação Internacional de Criadores do Cavalo Ibérico de Tipo Primitivo — Sorraia (AICS) has been approved under Commission Decision 92/353/EEC Commission Decision 92/353/EEC of 11 June 1992 laying down the criteria for the approval or recognition of organisations and associations which maintain or establish stud-books for registered equidae, OJ L 192, 11.7.1992 . for the establishment of a stud-book for Sorraia horses. In the agri-environmental measure Maintaining native breeds in the RDP for mainland Portugal (RURIS), the Portuguese authorities included provisions for the protection of the Sorraia breed. Therefore,
