ORAL QUESTION H-0908/06 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Yiannakis Matsis to the Commission Subject: Policy of the Turkish civil aviation authorities towards the Republic of Cyprus The Turkish civil aviation authorities refuse to cooperate in any way with their counterparts in the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union. In particular, Turkey refused to take part in a meeting called by the ICAO, the Commission and Eurocontrol last April. In contrast, the Turkish authorities maintain relations with the illegal 'authorities' of the unlawful airport at Tymbou located in the occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus. (See the relevant UN Security Council resolutions 541 and 550 which state that the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' and its 'authorities' are invalid). The stance taken by the Turkish civil aviation authorities endangers the Nicosia FIR. Moreover, the matter was raised by the IATA in a letter to the ICAO in January 2006. What measures will the Commission take in respect of Turkey to persuade that country to comply with international law and cooperate with the Republic of Cyprus, and to ensure that practical ways are found to resolve the problem of flight safety in the region?
