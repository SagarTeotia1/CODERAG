authorities calling upon it to: a) specify the data which could be legitimately transferred without risk (see the list of the 19 items suggested on 13 June 2003 by the Working Party referred to in Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC The data should include the following information: PNR record locator code, date of reservation, date(s) of travel, passenger name, other names held in the PNR, routing, free ticket identifiers, one-way tickets, ticketing field information, ATFQ (Automatic Ticket Fare Quote) data, ticket number, date upon which the ticket was issued, no-show history, number of items of luggage, luggage-label numbers, no-show information, number of items of luggage on each sector, voluntary or involuntary changes of class, details of changes made to the PNR data and relating to the above-mentioned items. ), b) immediately replace the 'pull' system (which is used without a legal basis by the US Administration and which has no filters for sensitive data or for non-transatlantic flights) with the 'push' system (which enables each airline to transfer only legitimate data and only in respect of flights to US destinations), c) negotiate an international agreement with the USA which will offer genuine guarantees for passengers or, at the very least, the same protection as is afforded to US citizens, L. sharing most of the reservations expressed unanimously by the data supervision authorities meeting within the Working Party referred to in Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC, in particular on 29 January 2004 http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2004/wp87_en.pdf , 1.
