Question for written answer E-009749/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Christine De Veyrac (PPE) (27 October 2011) Subject: Internet privacy protection Respect for their privacy and the manner in which their personal data is used online are growing concerns for Internet users. According to a Eurobarometer survey of June 2011, 62 % of Europeans choose to protect their privacy by divulging as little information as possible online, and 75 % would like to be able to delete their personal data at all times. Directive 2009/136/EC, which amended the applicable regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services, including Internet privacy, obliges Internet service operators and providers to inform their customers of any misuse of personal data in their possession. It also forbids websites from installing cookies without the user’s consent. Although the directive was due to enter in force in May 2011, only a small number of Member States have thus far transposed it into national law, and very few websites abide by these legal obligations. This state of affairs will continue to undermine the right to privacy and hinder the completion of the digital internal market unless greater transparency is imposed. Since the Commission is currently revising Directive 95/46/EC governing the general framework for data protection, could it say whether it intends to propose legislation on data sent via the Internet? If so, could it tell us what measures it will bring in to increase the security of personal data on the Internet?
