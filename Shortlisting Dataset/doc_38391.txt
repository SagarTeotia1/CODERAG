Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (20 January 2012) 1. The Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) informed the Commission (Eurostat) in July 2010 of the availability of new or improved statistical sources and methodology concerning in particular structural business surveys, household budget surveys and the estimation of gross fixed capital formation on dwellings. The 2011 revision of the Greek national accounts was carried out on that basis. It is common and good statistical practice in the European Union Member States that national accounts are updated when such information becomes available. This helps to ensure in particular the comparability of Member States national accounts data. The Commission (Eurostat) has supported this revision process with the assistance and advice of a national accounts expert in the context of the action plan for Greek statistics (Josgap). This Action Plan was first presented to the Economic and Financial Committee of May 2010 and aims to bring the Greek statistical system into line with EU quality requirements. The question of the information of the Greek Minister of Finance about this revision is an internal matter for Greece. 2. In the context of this revision, the main statistical aspects mentioned in Part 1 above have been considered by ELSTAT. In particular the structural business surveys for 2006, the household budget surveys for 2004/2005, and the dwellings price survey of 2008 were used. For statistics, this timeframe is consistent with what can be observed in other Member States. 3. The procedure described in Question E‑5184/2007 and centred on GNI Committee has been followed. In effect, the GNI Committee during its 26-27 October 2011 meeting examined the new GDP/GNI data transmitted by Greece and expressed a positive opinion on these data. Furthermore, it is standard practice in all European Union Member States that the countries publish their data by a press release before the GNI Committee meeting.
