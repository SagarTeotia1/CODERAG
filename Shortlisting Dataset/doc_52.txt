WRITTEN QUESTION E-0987/07 by Bernat Joan i Marí (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (28 February 2007) Subject: Path along the mediaeval city walls of Xàtiva, Valencia The Municipal Council of Xàtiva in Valencia has ostentatiously concreted over the ancient path along the mediaeval city walls on the east coast of Spain. According to the information available, this project, which cost a total of EUR 251 222, benefited from European Regional Fund financing of EUR 250 000 as a Community contribution to a heritage recovery programme. However, the renovation work on the path, involving the building of a concrete platform approximately 2.5 metres wide and 1.5 metres high, has not been carried out with respect for the surroundings. Is the Commission familiar with this work? Can the Commission confirm whether it was done using European funding? If it was, does not the Commission consider, bearing in mind that this financing was originally earmarked for heritage recovery, that this is a clear case of misuse of European funding?
