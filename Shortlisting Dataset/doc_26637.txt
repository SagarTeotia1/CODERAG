WRITTEN QUESTION E-3006/08 by Andrew Duff (ALDE) to the Commission (27 May 2008) Subject: VAT on R & D Could the Commission please clarify its latest position on the treatment of VAT in the context of the 7th R & D Framework Programme? In normal circumstances, grant-aid for research purposes is not considered to be a supply of services or a business activity for VAT purposes. Would it not be entirely sensible, therefore, to exempt from the scope of VAT the purchase of supplies related to research activities carried out under the EU Framework Programme? What is the position in each Member State with respect to reclaiming VAT for R & D purposes?
