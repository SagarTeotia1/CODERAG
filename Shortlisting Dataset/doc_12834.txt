WRITTEN QUESTION E-4934/05 by Monica Frassoni (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (6 January 2006) Subject: European Schools in Brussels On 8 December 2005, the Commission's Director-General for Personnel, Claude Chene, send all Commission staff an information note on the progress of work regarding the problem of overcrowding in the European Schools in Brussels. This note states that the problem of overcrowding in these schools must be resolved as a matter of urgency and proposes, as a solution, transferring pupils to provisional accommodation and, subsequently, opening a fourth European School in Laeken, to which a number of language sections from the existing schools (in particular the Italian, German and Dutch sections) would be transferred definitively. As the European Schools' main financial contributor, is the Commission aware of the costs which the setting-up of a school in Laeken will entail, with particular reference to the pupils' transport and the possible forced move of families who currently live near the existing schools to other parts of the city? Is the Commission prepared to bear such costs?
