Question for written answer E-002638/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (21 March 2011) Subject: Exploitation of geothermal energy Europe's biggest geothermal heat pump came into operation yesterday, at One New Change, a shopping centre in London. 150 metres below ground, a 60‑km articulated tube structure transfers heat from and to an underground layer of water, thus providing the centre with a natural heating and cooling source. This system, which has been created by the company Geothermal International, is expected to permit emissions savings of 250 tonnes of CO 2 per annum. Given that: — geothermal energy currently accounts for less than 1 % of the world's total energy production; — a recent study by MIT (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) found the global potential of geothermal energy to be in the region of 13 000 ZJ, the exploitable figure with the existing technologies being 2 000 ZJ; — total world energy consumption amounts to 0.5 ZJ per annum, while geothermal energy on its own could satisfy the planet's energy needs for the next 4 000 years, thus making redundant all other, non-renewable energy sources currently in use, does the Commission intend to support and promote installations using this type of renewable energy, thus reducing pressure on the environment?
