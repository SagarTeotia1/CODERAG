Question for written answer E-001677/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (10 February 2012) Subject: Commission support for regional consumer education schools The Commission has just put an end to the Dolceta online consumer education programme due to its inability to meet trainers’ needs, its lack of visibility and the lack of visitors to this site. The Commission acknowledges spending more than EUR 9 million on this initiative. Can the Commission indicate: — Is it aware of the existence in several regions of the Member States of consumer education schools set up by regional authorities, towns or consumer organisations? — If so, does it support these initiatives which are very successful, but lack the means to develop? — If not, why does it not wish to devote part of the budget previously allocated to Dolceta to helping these schools and setting up other schools before the end of 2013?
