Question for written answer E-001896/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (16 February 2012) Subject: Renewable energy: plantations at risk Multinational companies operating in certain European countries have come up with an alternative way to obtain energy from biomass. This is, in fact, an important objective set out in the EU directive that seeks to increase the use of alternative sources, including biomass. This aim can be pursued by building power stations fuelled by agricultural and forest biomass. A British research institute has studied the implications of this project, which entails the purchase of areas of land in countries in the global south and in Africa, where trees will be planted. They will subsequently be transported to the country of origin and used in the biomass industries to generate energy. All this is in order to meet the growing international demand for timber, which countries in the global north can no longer satisfy. The advantages of this process are, in the medium term, fewer carbon dioxide emissions, and, in the long term, lower tariffs once the costs of the mechanism have been amortised. The doubts raised over this system concern the disruption that various populations could suffer. They occupy national soil, even if they do not own it, and could therefore be forced to move in the event that the governments decide to sell the land. Considering that this process, strongly called for by certain countries, could devastate the lives of entire populations that do not have the necessary resources to deal with such a situation, can the Commission state whether it intends to issue specific regulations in order to protect indigenous populations from exploitation of the land?
