launched at a roundtable meeting in New York on 23 September 2009. Subsequent conferences have taken place where the proposed framework on RAI has been presented and discussed, such as at the European Development Days in Stockholm in October 2009, a roundtable on RAI held at the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Washington, D.C. on April 25, the World Bank Annual Land Conference and the UNCTAD meeting of the Investment, Enterprise and Development Commission from 26‑30 April 2010. The Commission considers the active implication of civil society organisations at all stages of the consultation process to be crucial,, in particular the participation by farmers and women organisations and representatives of indigenous populations. Collaboration between state, civil society, bilateral and multilateral stakeholders, with the ultimate objective of pro-poor land governance, is also enshrined in the EU Land Policy Guidelines http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2004:0686:FIN:EN:PDF adopted in 2004, which are meant in particular to make staff involved in development programmes aware of efforts to accompany land reform and design programmes in support of national reform efforts. Given the links between land governance, food security and investments in agriculture, the Commission has integrated the issue of large scale land acquisitions in the Commission Staff Working Paper that accompanied the communication ‘An EU policy framework to assist developing countries in addressing food security challenges’, which was adopted by the Commission on 31 March 2010 Communication from the Commission: An EU policy framework to assist developing countries in addressing food security challenges (COM(2010)127) and Staff Working Document (SEC(2010)379) http://ec.europa.eu/development/policies/9interventionareas/ruraldev/food_intro_en.cfm . With a new co-funding of EUR 2.9 million to the International Land Coalition http://www.landcoalition.org , the EU contributes to capacity building of civil society organisations and networks in Africa, with the aim to promote secure access to land and other resources. The EU also contributes through a new EUR 9 million programme with the African Union Commission and spell out UNECA in support of the implementation of the Africa Union Land Policy Initiative. Specific support for land policies and land administration is provided in a number of countries (Namibia, Bangladesh, Madagascar, Angola, Jamaica, Rwanda, Tajikistan, Venezuela and Vietnam).
