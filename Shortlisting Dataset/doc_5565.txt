Believes that the rights involved should not be understood as property rights but as a kind of usufruct or a right to harvest and subject, accordingly, to appropriate limitations; 4. Recognises also, however, that there are separately identifiable systems of RBM that are based on different understandings: a) as to whom the right is to be allocated, as to the conditions of its transferability and as to its tradability for economic value, b) as to the extent of the right, particularly whether it is defined in terms of the location in which it is to be exercised, the quantity that may be fished or the effort that can be expended; 5. Welcomes the fact that the Commission has put out a call for tenders to allow for a full study of the various management systems; 6. Considers that the period for debate which has been set is too short and calls for it to be extended to ensure that the various possibilities available are properly explored and studied, along with their consequences; 7. Recognises, however, even in advance of such a study, that it is evident that there is a wide variety of such systems in place and that most, if not all, employ some form of RBM, if this is taken in its widest sense; recognises, likewise, that experiments with management through fishing rights in Member States which have applied such systems have had very positive consequences in many respects, for example in terms of capacity reduction; 8. Considers that it is similarly evident that, at Community level and within at least some of the Member States, the forms of RBM employed are hybrid ones, in terms both of the allocation and transferability/tradability of the rights and of the way in which their scope is defined; 9. Notes the degree of complexity involved and the difficulties this poses for movement toward a single system, whether achieved through harmonising the practices of Member States or by its administration at Community level; 10. Nevertheless takes the view that, as shown by the fact that RBM in fisheries has been introduced in many of the countries and regions which have the most significant fishing interests in the world, these difficulties are not insurmountable and, given that the system could prove highly positive for the management of certain Community fleets, consideration should at least be given to the possibilities for including it in the CFP; 11. Considers it necessary to ascertain the effects which changes, particularly the introduction of Community-wide individual transferable quotas and other rights-based access, might have in relation to: – relative stability and its role in maintaining the viability of fisheries-dependent communities, – the degree of concentration of ownership of such rights and the resulting socio-economic consequences, – the advantages that could accrue to large companies at the expense of small-scale operators or community-based fisheries, – the fear that additional costs may be involved, creating disincentives towards investment in vessels, gear, safety and working conditions, – the likelihood of quotas being held at one remove from those actively engaged in fishing, –
