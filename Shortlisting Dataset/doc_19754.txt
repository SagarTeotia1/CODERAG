Stresses that the EUR 1 billion pledges by both the Commission and the Member States should be implemented without resorting to either the relabelling as AfT of aid formerly classified as aid for infrastructure or the double-counting, by Member States, of bilateral aid and contributions to the EU's external aid; 55.
