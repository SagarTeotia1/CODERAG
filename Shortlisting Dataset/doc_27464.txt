WRITTEN QUESTION E-2295/06 by Czesław Siekierski (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (23 May 2006) Subject: Direct payments for Polish farmers Through no fault of their own, some Polish farmers will be unable to submit their applications for direct payments on time. Responsibility for this situation lies with the Polish authorities, which, largely for objective reasons, have failed to provide farmers with adequate maps of their land. The Polish Government has asked the Commission to extend the application deadline for Polish farmers to 30 June 2006. In my capacity as a Member of the European Parliament, I have attended a series of meetings with farmers and this matter is frequently raised. I therefore echo the request for the application deadline to be extended or for farmers to escape penalisation in the form of a reduction in the amount they receive in direct payments for each day the application deadline is exceeded. A decision by the Commission to grant such a request will considerably increase Polish farmers' trust in the European Union, which is of great importance to the future of a united Europe. I am presenting these arguments in the hope that the Commission will take a positive decision. When will the Commission decide on this matter?
