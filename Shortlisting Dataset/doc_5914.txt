Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (13 September 2011) The Commission does not consider the Canadian request for a panel against the EU prohibition on the sale of seal products to have a negative impact on the negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada. The Commission has no intention of proposing any amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 nor to its Implementing Regulation or in any other way reducing the seal products ban in the EU. The Commission believes that the claim that EU is not respecting its WTO obligations is unfounded. The measures adopted are not protectionist, are not discriminatory and respond to concerns about the killing of seals and their commercialisation which are widely held in the EU, as confirmed by the overwhelming support for the legislation in the EU Member States and the Parliament. The Commission will vigorously defend these measures.
