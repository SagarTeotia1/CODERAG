WRITTEN QUESTION E-0023/08 by Mario Borghezio (UEN) to the Commission (16 January 2008) Subject: The EU should establish why all the leading Italian financial institutions are based in Luxembourg Recent years have seen what are effectively the head offices of the cream of Italy's financial sector, including Fiat Finance, IFIL Investissements, Italcementi, Italmobiliare, Merloni Finanziaria, Family Finance, Franco Tosi Finance, Dorint Holding, Pirelli Finance and Marcegaglia International Holding S.a., spring up like mushrooms within an area of less than one square kilometre in the capital city of Luxembourg — which lies right in the heart of the EU. Will the Commission finally find the time and the will to conduct an investigation into this amusing anomaly in the EU's financial and fiscal arrangements?
