Question for written answer E-6924/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (6 September 2010) Subject: Supply of scandium and EU international political and economic measures According to analysts and experts, the future global economic and geopolitical framework will depend not only on the energy race but also on the supply of the raw materials that are necessary for human and animal food production and the production of goods for mass consumption, as well as for strategic industrial sectors such as the military and high-technology industries. Among the materials that are currently attracting the attention of financial operators and governments are a number of rare elements such as scandium, which is vital for future production of high-tech goods. 1. Given the strategic importance of the element in question, does the Commission consider that it would be in the EU's interest to facilitate the procurement of scandium for the Member States' industrial sectors? What action does it think it could take in the field of international political and economic relations in order to achieve that objective? 2. Does the Commission consider that it should take or promote action to address the fact that China, which is the source of most of the scandium used in industry worldwide, is adopting increasingly restrictive policies on the export of this rare element in an attempt to attract into its own territory the production of goods whose components are manufactured using scandium?
