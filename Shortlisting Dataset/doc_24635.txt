Question for Question Time H-000014/2011 to the Council Part-session: February 2011 Rule 116 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) Subject: Initiatives on the management of water and drinking water In its publicity material setting out its priorities, the Hungarian Presidency has expressed the desire to give special attention to issues of water and drinking water management, as well as extreme events related to water resources. Since the programme does not specify which policies it will follow in this connection, would the Presidency inform the EP precisely which steps it intends to take in this area? Does it consider that over the next few years a specific problem will arise as regards the management and security of supply of water resources and drinking water in European Member States?
