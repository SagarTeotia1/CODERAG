ORAL QUESTION H-0651/05 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jerzy Buzek to the Commission Subject: Investment in Yamal 2 and Amber In accordance with the provisions of the Green Paper on EU energy policy, the Community must play an important role in ensuring that gas network operation meets the needs of the internal market and all the Member and candidate States. The document stresses the importance of routing the gas pipelines considering the 'interests of EU Member and candidate States, as well as those which are not part of the EU, including Ukraine'. In this context, could the Commission clarify what steps will be taken to ensure the speediest possible EU-Russian investment in the Yamal 2 and Amber pipelines? These investments will ensure energy security for a significant portion of the Member States, guaranteeing cheaper gas and upholding environmental protection principles, as opposed to the planned investment in the Northern European pipeline which is environmentally dubious; initial estimates of its cost are five times greater and it does not guarantee energy security for Central European and the Baltic States. It must be remembered that the sites for the construction of Yamal 2 have already been prepared and a number of investments have also been made, thus guaranteeing faster completion of the pipeline.
