WRITTEN QUESTION E-4449/08 by Rebecca Harms (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (4 August 2008) Subject: Euratom-IAEA joint statement On 7 May 2008 a joint statement was signed between the European Commission (Dominique Ristori) and the IAEA (Vilmos Cserveny) on stepping up their cooperation on nuclear energy for peace and development under the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty) and, more particularly, in the framework of the cooperation agreement between the European Atomic Energy Community and the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the said joint statement, the priority areas for such cooperation include the ‘enhancement of national infrastructure, as needed, in countries wishing to launch new nuclear power programmes’ as well as ‘legal affairs and legislative assistance’. The Community's relevant tasks are set out in Article 2 of the Euratom Treaty, and further specified in the provisions which follow. In the field of external relations, more particularly, Article 101 specifies that the Community's actions should remain ‘within the limits of its powers and jurisdiction’. 1. In the Commission's opinion, are the aforementioned priorities covered by the Euratom Treaty? If yes, on which Treaty provisions would Community action in those areas — as broadly defined in the abovementioned text — be based, taking into account, further, the restrictive definition of and recent case-law limitations on the Commission’s competences concerning investment in nuclear power projects? 2. Was the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, Javier Solana, involved in the preparation of the joint statement? 3. How does the High Representative evaluate the risk of proliferation in connection with a nuclear expansion as proposed in the joint statement?
