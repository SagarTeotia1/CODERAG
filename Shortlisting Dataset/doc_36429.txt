Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2008) The Commission has taken note of the fact that Parliamentary elections held in Russia on 2 December 2007 took place in an orderly and organised fashion. At the same time, however, it regrets the fact that they gave rise to a number of serious concerns about the restriction of democratic freedoms. The Commission estimates that the presence of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) would have constituted a reliable basis for a full assessment of the elections; the absence of a long term observation mission from ODIHR/OSCE (the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe) to follow the election campaign due to the limitations and restrictions placed by the Russian Government was in itself a regrettable fact that should not set a precedent. Certain international and domestic reports presented evidence that Parliamentary elections failed to meet OSCE and Council of Europe standards and commitments voluntarily assumed by Russia for fair and democratic elections. This resulted in limited political competition, most notably through frequent abuse of administrative resources, strong media bias in favour of the ruling party and an election code that made it extremely difficult for new and smaller parties to compete effectively. There were also allegations of media restrictions and harassment of opposition parties and non-governmental organisations in the run up to the elections and on election day as well. The Commission hopes that further investigations will clarify the accuracy of these allegations. Furthermore, it calls Russian authorities to ensure timely invitation for ODIHR/OSCE and guarantee a free and fair process for March 2008 Presidential elections.
