WRITTEN QUESTION E-6470/07 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (9 January 2008) Subject: The terrorist organisation PKK Recently the Chief of the Turkish Armed Forces, General Büyükanıt, stated that the terrorist organisation PKK was legitimised in Turkey as it is represented in the Turkish Parliament by the Kurdish parliamentarians' party DTP. If General Büyükanıt is right, shouldn't the EU also legitimise PKK by removing its name from the EU's terrorist list? Or is General Büyükanıt just talking plain nonsense, which is my view?
