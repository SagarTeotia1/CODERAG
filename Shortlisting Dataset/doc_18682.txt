Question for written answer E-3734/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Alfredo Antoniozzi (PPE) (25 May 2010) Subject: New legal basis for sport under the Lisbon Treaty — Commission follow-up As a result of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, sport is now mentioned in the Treaties for the first time, giving it a legal basis that enables the EU to propose specific legislative initiatives in this area. In the light of this key legislative development, could the Commission indicate: — the legislative initiatives it intends to present in this area? — the fields of sport in which it thinks it ought to intervene by regulatory means? — the specific sports funding programmes it intends to propose? As things stand, there are no specific funding programmes in the sport sector, nor any EU funding instruments for sports events, especially at municipal level.
