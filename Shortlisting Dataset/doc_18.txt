Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (9 July 2010) The supervision and monitoring of adverse reactions of authorised medicines, being under prescription or not, are carried out through the EU’s pharmacovigilance system. Pharmacovigilance is based on the reporting, collection and management of reports on suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products. Competent authorities of Member States and the European Medicines Agency are evaluating this data with a view to deciding how best to protect public health. Ultimately, under this system, any product which presents an unacceptable level of risk, can be rapidly withdrawn from the market. In December 2008, the Commission adopted proposals amending the existing EU legislation on pharmacovigilance (provisions in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC). They aim at strengthening and rationalizing the EU pharmacovigilance system, with the overall objectives of better protecting public health, ensuring proper functioning of the internal market and simplifying the current procedures. One aspect of these proposals is to strengthen the reporting system for adverse reactions by rationalising the current system and involving all stakeholders in pharmacovigilance. To this end, the legal proposals include provisions that would make it possible for patients to report adverse reactions. These proposals are currently being discussed at the Council and the European Parliament and adoption is expected in the autumn 2010.
