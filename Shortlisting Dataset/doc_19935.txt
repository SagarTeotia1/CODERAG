WRITTEN QUESTION E-5826/09 by Nuno Melo (PPE) to the Commission (24 November 2009) Subject: Changes to the ERDF and Cohesion Fund regulations in Portugal In September 2009 the Portuguese Government made changes to the regulations governing the ERDF and Cohesion Fund which make it possible to divert appropriations from the country's poorest regions to Lisbon. The Portuguese Government negotiated this derogation from the NSRF with the Commission. The derogation that was approved forms part of an annex concerning implementing rules for the structural funds. This arrangement makes it possible to divert funds intended for the so-called convergence regions to be used in Lisbon, provided that the investments also have an impact in the rest of the country. This is known as the ‘spill-over effect’. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Why was this derogation negotiated with Portugal during the negotiations on the structural funds provided for in the NSRF 2007‑13? 2. How will the spill-over effect that justified the approval of this derogation be assessed? 3. If there is no sufficient evidence of this effect, how will it be possible to compensate the convergence regions that were unable to benefit from the appropriations intended for them during this period? 4. If this spill-over effect does not materialise, will this not mean that the approval of this derogation has in fact helped to widen the existing gap between the richest regions and the poorest?
