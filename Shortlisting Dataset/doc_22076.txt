the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) by reason of the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the European Union ( COM(2004)0592 – C6 0118/2004 – 2004/0202(COD)) Doc.: A6-0067/2005 Procedure : Codecision (1st reading) Vote : 12.04.2005 Vote In adopting a legislative resolution on the classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) following enlargement, Parliament approved the Commission proposal subject to one amendment supporting a new Commission study into introducing a new (fourth) level of NUTS. The amendment adopted by the EP concerns ' smaller administrative units ' which would reflect real circumstances more accurately and avoid anomalies such as the presence of regional units with very different populations within the same NUTS level. NUTS subdivides each Member State into a whole number of NUTS 1 regions, each of which is in turn subdivided into a whole number of NUTS 2 regions and so on. So this is basically a geographical breakdown which is used for regional policy.
