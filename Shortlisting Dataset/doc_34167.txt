WRITTEN QUESTION E-4016/09 by Sophia in 't Veld (ALDE) to the Commission (5 August 2009) Subject: Discrimination by health insurers on grounds of nationality EU citizens who are not Irish nationals but wish to take out health insurance in Ireland have to wait between six months and a year, depending on their age, before they can actually claim any medical expenses. Logically enough, this entails a substantial risk, as people cannot know in advance that they will require medical treatment, so that policy-holders may find themselves compelled to pay the full cost of medical treatment themselves. This waiting period does not apply to Irish nationals. 1. Is the Commission aware of this situation? 2. Does it constitute discrimination on grounds of nationality? 3. Will the Commission take steps under Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union to halt this practice and ensure that the Irish authorities comply with legislation outlawing discrimination?
