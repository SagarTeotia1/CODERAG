Question for written answer E-006923/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (18 July 2011) Subject: International rating agencies Is the Commission satisfied that the international rating agencies which make judgments and forecasts in relation to the economic status and performance of eurozone states are competent to do so? Is the Commission planning to regulate these entities and their activities? Does the Commission have any concerns that these private companies lack transparency, and that they may have vested interests? Is the Commission concerned that one or two rating agencies hold the power to send a country into recession by their claims, whether accurate or more worryingly when their statements are false based on vested interests or inaccurate information?
