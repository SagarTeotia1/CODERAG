Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2012) The EU follows the human rights situation in this country very closely. The European Union has always firmly and publicly condemned human rights violations and other crimes committed by the different armed factions in Colombia, and called for the respect of human rights and international humanitarian norms. This issue is also regularly raised in high-level political dialogue meetings and in démarches vis-à-vis the Colombian government, as well as in the bilateral human rights dialogue. In these meetings, the EU has discussed and encouraged the positive measures carried by the Colombian government towards human rights enforcement, including the development and implementation of national legislation, the creation of a national system of human rights and the summoning of national conferences on human rights (the next to be held by the end of the year). The EEAS has raised the case of Diomedes Carvajalino with the Colombian authorities. According to the information received, Mr Carvajalino, a former member of the ELN guerrilla, is presently detained in the model prison of Cucuta, where around-the-clock medical attention necessary in view of his medical condition is being provided to him. Concerning the fight against torture, the EU supports various projects executed by NGOs. Indeed, many of the organisations that form the Colombia Coalition against Torture are beneficiaries of EU financing. The Trade Agreement to which the Honourable Members make reference is another important tool to improve the human rights situation in the country. In this respect, the Honourable Members are referred to the replies given to written questions E‑002210/2011 by the Honourable Members themselves, E‑1751/10 by Mr Romeva i Rueda, E‑6626/09 by Ms Sârbu, E‑6155/09 by Mr Brons, and E‑5967/2011 , E‑5969/2011 , E‑5996/2011 , E‑6016/2011 and E‑6036/2011 by Mr Meyer http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp .
