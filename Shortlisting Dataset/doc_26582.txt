WRITTEN QUESTION E-3001/04 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (25 November 2004) Subject: Redundancies at the ARA factory (Portugal) The foootwear multinational ARA, which owns factories in Portugal, is now cutting jobs and throwing its workers into unemployment, as was recently the case at the Avintes factory, which employed some 200 people at Vila Nova de Gaia. Unemployment in that locality already stands at 17% of the active population, i.e. over 25000 people, including 15000 women. The situation has been worsened by other recent factory closures by multinationals such as Elefanten, Clarks and Brax. Can the Commission state: 1. whether the multinational ARA has received Community funding, in particular for its factories in Portugal, and, if so, how much and under what conditions; 2. what measures are proposed to stop relocations and protect jobs in which workers can enjoy their rights, especially for firms receiving Community funding; 3. what measures are proposed to support the creation of jobs accompanied by workers' rights, particularly in the industrial areas now being hit by one factory closure after another in the wake of relocations by multinationals to candidate countries, new EU Member States or even Asian or northern European countries?
