WRITTEN QUESTION E-5346/09 by Roger Helmer (ECR) to the Commission (28 October 2009) Subject: Figures on lost and stolen items I have received a request from a constituent concerning the European Commission. My constituent had jewellery stolen from her airline baggage in February 2009. Since then she had been told that the European Commission was going to publish figures on lost and stolen items, but this commitment has since been dropped. Can the Commission guarantee that this commitment will be reinstated?
