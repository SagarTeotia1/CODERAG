the EU becomes involved at a financial level in supporting civil society activities. They call on Member States to cover as far as possible, through public financing, the services proposed by professional civil organisations and request that financial measures be set out in order to assist voluntary organisations and parents’ associations that take action in the fight against drugs. While they welcome the launch of the 2007-2013 “Specific Programme on Drugs Prevention and Information”, they regret the delay in the implementation of the funding made available in connection with that Programme.

MEPs in the Legal Affairs Committee recommend approving the text at second reading with no amendments to the Council's common position. Mediation can provide a cost-efficient and quick extra-judicial resolution of disputes. The Commission's proposal for a directive to promote its use everywhere in the EU has reached its final stage. If the plenary confirms the approval of the report by Arlene McCarthy (PES, UK), the new provisions on mediation in cross-border cases will be need to be implemented within three years. Right to choose mediation to solve dispute MEPs in the committee and the Council agreed that recourse to mediation must always be voluntary, even if, in some cases it is advised by a court. In any event an EU citizen who chose a mediation procedure to resolve a dispute would not thereby be precluded from recourse to an ordinary court. To ensure that any agreement reached by the parties to mediation proceedings is enforced, the text specifies that the agreement should be applicable in all Member States. Confidentiality ens ured The Council had endorsed MEPs' first-reading position on confidentiality, to ensure that neither mediators nor the parties involved in the proceedings may disclose information regarding the mediation. The approved text also asks Member States to provide training for national mediators and to encourage the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to guarantee a fair trial. At a later stage, EU governments could post the list of trained mediators on the internet. An opt-out means that the legislation will not apply to Denmark.
