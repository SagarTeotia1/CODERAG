Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (17 November 2005) During the accession negotiations, the Maltese authorities negotiated a transition period concerning the Birds Directive Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 103, 25.4.1979 as modified by Commission Directive 91/244/EEC of 6 March 1991, OJ L 115, 8.5.1991. allowing the continued capture of certain bird species with clap nets within the Maltese islands until the end of 2008 in accordance with certain intermediate targets. The possible hunting in Malta of turtle-doves and quails in spring was not, on the other hand, negotiated between the Maltese Government and the European Union during the accession negotiations. The Maltese Government has only exercised its option to apply a derogation, on the basis that turtle-doves and quails are only present in large numbers during the spring migration, and therefore spring provides the only opportunity for them to be hunted. There are similar derogations in other areas of the EU, and Malta has the same potential to apply a derogation that meets all the requirements of Article 9 of the Birds Directive. However, to be valid, the derogation of spring hunting must comply with all the conditions set out under the directive. Therefore, it is for the Maltese Government to demonstrate that the spring hunting season is very limited and strict quotas on numbers of birds hunted are imposed and enforced. As is the case with other Member States seeking to apply a derogation under Article 9, the Maltese Government has been asked to present the case for this derogation in its annual report on derogations required by the directive. The Commission will then ensure that the consequences of these derogations are compatible with the directive. The Commission is willing to provide this clarification in writing to the Maltese authorities.
