decision, which is equivalent to a general exemption for the use of DecaBDE in electrical and electronic equipment, was adopted when the conditions laid down by the Community legislature in Article 5(1) of the RoHS Directive had not been met and runs counter to the objective pursued by that legislature of establishing the principle of prohibition of the components referred to in that directive. In adopting that decision as regards the exemption of DecaBDE, the Commission thus infringed Article 5(1). ). If the Commission's recast proposal is adopted as proposed, also the list of banned substances can be amended by Comitology.
