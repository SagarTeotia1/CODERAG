to the harmonisation. The harmonisation was based in the first instance on the existing situation of pesticide use in each Member State, which was reflected in more than 20 lists of national MRLs. For many crop-pesticide combinations these MRLs differred among the Member States, despite the free circulation of agricultural products on the EU market. In the process of the risk assessment for 96 pesticides, one or more MRLs were identified not to be safe for all EU consumer groups, including children and had to be reduced. Consequently, the national authorisations for the respective use of those pesticides on certain crops had to be withdrawn. For an additional 176 pesticides, the Member States have voluntarily witdrawn all remaining uses before the EFSA screening was started. Therefore, the harmonisation leads to an overall reduction of consumer exposure in the EU. When harmonising MRLs, the Commission took as a basis ‘the lowest achievable level consistent with good agricultural practice in all Member States’. In the division of competences under Directive 91/414/EEC Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, OJ L 230, 19.8.1991. on the marketing and use of plant protection products, it is, however, not the Commission, but the Member States who are responsible for specifying the agricultural practice for each pest/pesticide/crop combination that leads to the lowest achievable residue level on their territory. Because pests and losses they cause are different in Member States, not all crops are being treated with the same amount of pesticides throughout the EU. The ‘lowest achievable residue level consistent with good agricultural practice in all Member States’ is therefore the level in the Member State with the most critical agricultural practice.
