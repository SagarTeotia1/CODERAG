restoration of older buildings and the construction of passive houses and zero-emission houses; 15. Welcomes the launch of the consultation and partnership process on ICTs; calls on the Commission and the Member States to support closer cooperation amongst all the partners in the construction, energy-efficiency and ICT sector, in particular by means of Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs) such as the Artemis JTI and the Energy Efficient Buildings (E2B) JTI; calls on all the partners to work together to develop open norms and standards so as to ensure that different technologies are compatible; 16. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide active support for research and technological development and demonstration projects relating to new ICTs and their applications which offer high potential for energy efficiency, especially micro- and nano-electronics and emerging quantum- and photonics-based technologies; 17. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide active support for research and technological development and demonstration projects relating to lighting technologies and intelligent lighting applications, so that the introduction of more energy-efficient lighting in both indoor and outdoor public spaces - with an emphasis on highly efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) - can be more vigorously promoted; urges the Commission and the Member States to promote research into lighting systems as a whole, and not only into components of such systems; 18. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to exploit to the utmost the potential of the Galileo satellite-navigation system so as to ensure that the broadest possible use is made of the relevant applications in combination with ICTs in the transport field, in particular in connection with the management and organisation of traffic flows, real-time information concerning the movement of goods and persons and optimised selection of routes and modes of transport; 19. Calls on the Member States to cooperate at national and local level in coordinating an approach to energy-efficient mobility and to environmentally-friendly mobility based on intelligent solutions offered by ICTs (such as private transport optimisation, smart logistics, efficient vehicles and traffic-flow monitoring, planning and simulation), so as to ensure interoperability, lower costs and greater impact; calls, further, on the Member States to support standardisation bodies in framing and introducing EU and global standards for smart transport systems; 20. Calls on the Member States to launch programmes and incentives aimed at improving the emissions performance of existing vehicles, in particular by using advanced ICT solutions when retrofitting emissions-control systems and through the deployment of real-time mobile monitoring platforms; 21. Encourages the Member States to promote information campaigns on energy-saving behaviour aimed at the general public and training in energy-efficient driving behaviour for drivers of road vehicles; notes that, in this context, high priority should be given to the launching of pilot programmes to demonstrate best-practice implementation in transport, especially involving added-value ICT solutions to existing problems at local level; 22. Calls on the Commission to publish a ‘best experiences’ guide for local authorities concerning energy-efficient solutions to traffic management and to cooperate with industry representatives on a list of ‘eco-innovations’ in order to make eco-driving a reality
