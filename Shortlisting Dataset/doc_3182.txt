EU to invest €150 million The Seventh Research Framework Programme will co-finance the AAL programme to the sum of €150 million for 2008-2013. To ensure success, participating countries should jointly contribute at least the same or possibly a higher amount, says the text. Each participating country is expected to allocate at least 20% of its national research funding to AAL-related activities. MEPs say that if the programme is implemented inadequately, partially or late, the Community will reduce or terminate its financial contribution. This participation should be subject to a minimum financial contribution commensurate with the potential demand from the various national research communities and should normally be at least €0.2 million for the participation The amended proposal also emphasises that overlaps with existing national and other Community programmes should be avoided. Entry into force This Decision enters into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

The report stresses that the key objectives of the fund should be the promotion of energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies, the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases and of other risks, the improvement of access to energy services in the poorest countries and the diversification of energy sources in the developing world. The European Parliament insists that all support for projects and choice of technology is conditional on the fulfilment of comprehensive sustainability criteria and on a contribution being made to sustainable development, among other things. The report was adopted with 343 votes in favour, 11 against and 11 abstentions. Members call on the Commission to focus, when implementing the fund, on small-scale projects which are the most difficult to attract private sector investment. In this regard, the Commission should keep under regular review its eligibility threshold of €10 million for individual projects, while earmarking at least one third of the funds available for small-scale projects costing less than €1 million. The European Commission is also invited to: ensure that support for all biomass projects in developing countries is subject to the fulfilment of rigorous sustainability criteria; ensure that the GEEREF supports photovoltaic projects and calls on it to support the development of intelligent grid technologies; ensure that the fund supports the development of local markets, manufacturing and capacity by supporting local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) so that they can take on responsibility for merchandising new technologies in a particular region; ensure that the fund will be consistent with and supplement other Member State and EU development policies and
