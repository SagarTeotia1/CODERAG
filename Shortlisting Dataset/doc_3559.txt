navigation equipment, maintenance and transport of dangerous goods by air, and working hours for aircrews. Flight and duty time limitations and rest periods A major victory for Parliament at first reading was the introduction of a maximum basic daily Flight Duty Period (FDP). This will be 13 hours but can be extended by up to one hour. When an FDP starts at night (between 22:00h to 04:59h) it is limited to a maximum of 11.45 hours. The minimum rest at " home base " must be at least as long as the preceding duty period or at least 12 hours (" away from home ", the minimum rest is at least 10 hours). At second reading, the Transport Committee decided that, within two years after entry into force of the regulation, the European Aviation Safety Agency must complete a scientific and medical evaluation of the provisions on FDPs. If necessary, the Commission must then submit a new proposal amending these provisions. MEPs also introduced a clause stipulating that " under no circumstances " may the regulation be used to water down existing safety standards in the Member States. Labour agreements providing for better conditions on flight and duty periods can thus be retained. Overnight express cargo - a special case However, the Transport Committee regards overnight express cargo service providers as a special case. It says that where a roster system is based on staff becoming accustomed to nightshifts by limiting the number of dayshift/nightshift changes, any disruptions to rosters may have a negative impact on the level of safety of operating models. The committee therefore proposes that the Commission be asked to carry out an assessment and propose an adjustment of the provisions regarding flight and duty time limitations " to take account of these special operating models ". Harmonisation of cabin crew training Lastly the committee calls for cabin crew training to be harmonised to create high European standards. Mutual recognition of training qualifications, with the option of licensing cabin crews, would be a solution. In view of the rapidly growing volume of air traffic, rapporteur Ulrich STOCKMANN (PES, DE)stresses the urgent need to establish, at EU level, " uniform high safety standards, which have not hitherto been provided for in some Member States ".

HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis continue to cause the deaths of some six million people each year, wipe out years of development efforts and achievements and constitute a serious long term concern due to their destabilising effects on society. The European Union and its neighbouring countries now face
