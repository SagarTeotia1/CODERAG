proposal for an informal dialogue in the course of the discharge procedure. MEPs had been upset that, unlike last year, the Council had refused this year to reply to the questions sent to it by the committee. In the case of the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice, MEPs asked Parliament's Budgets Committee to hold part of the 2005 administrative appropriations in reserve if there is no satisfactory response to the EP's concern over non-official car use and the system of salary weightings. Members of the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice enjoy the right to have their salaries transferred to another EU country with an added " coefficient " or top-up figure. Also, members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors can use official cars for private ends up to a ceiling of respectively 30,000 and 40,000 kilometres per year. MEPs also proposed that discharge be granted to the Economic and Social Committee and the Ombudsman. In the resolution accompanying the discharge for the Committee of the Regions, MEPs said that the implementation of the reforms forced through by Parliament after it had postponed discharge over the year 2001 would be verified during the discharge procedure for the year 2003. MEPs said a root and branch overhaul of senior management, working methods and respect for internal audit were essential and that they were surprised at the dismissal of the findings and recommendations in the OLAF report, which was very critical. They also deplored the treatment of the then Financial Controller - who has since become the Internal Auditor - and wanted to know why the internal audit unit had not yet been strengthened. They called for the necessary steps to be taken to ensure the total independence of the Internal Auditor. Criticism was also expressed at the fact that the administrative inquiry was not concluded until April but that the Administration has already earlier established that the Internal Auditor has not been harassed at all.
