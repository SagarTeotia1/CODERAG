ORAL QUESTION H-0704/03 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Ewa Hedkvist Petersen to the Commission Subject: Trafficking of human beings It is difficult for people from third countries seeking refuge to enter the EU. In recent times, we have witnessed appalling disasters in which people searching for a more secure life have met with death beyond the EU's borders. We must stop the trafficking of human beings and those individuals making huge profits from the misfortunes of others. An interesting proposal has been put to the Commission with a view to reducing the market for people smugglers and making the EU more accessible for people from third countries. What is the Commission's view of a system whereby refugees would be able to apply for a special asylum visa at Member States' embassies and consulates around the world?
