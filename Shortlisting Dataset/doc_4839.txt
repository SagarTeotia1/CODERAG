and for less cost, at the same time helping to increase security of supply as a result of such timely improvements; Transport 40. Calls on the Commission to set minimum energy performance requirements for all transport modes, including public transport; stresses the need for an energy-efficient transport policy giving preference to public transport, cycling and walking in urban areas; welcomes the Green Paper on Urban Transport and calls on the Commission to launch an initiative specifically concerning urban transport and the issue of integrating climate protection, energy saving and public health in a sustainable mobility policy for towns and cities; encourages urban authorities in the EU to consider measures to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and from passenger car traffic, for example by means of congestion charges; recalls that binding annual car emissions in respect of all new passenger cars sold contribute to the EU reaching its binding CO2 targets; 41. Calls for Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars to enable car labelling using a clear multi-class rating system as used in appliance labelling (currently the seven-class A to G scale) OJ L 12, 18.1.2000, p. 16. ; proposes that a minimum of 20% of any space devoted to the advertising and marketing of new cars should provide information on fuel efficiency and emissions; 42. Regrets also that the directive proposed in respect of passenger car taxation, aimed at reducing CO2 emissions in line with the EU's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, has still not been adopted by the Council, and urges its rapid adoption and implementation; 43. Calls on the Commission to devise a framework strategy to facilitate substantive improvements to the efficiency of urban and suburban public transport, requiring operators of urban and suburban public transport systems to conduct studies and feasibility studies focusing on system-related efficiency and service levels, the strategy in question being geared to adjusting the establishment of horizontal support schemes aimed at developing public transport systems in such a way that those schemes comply with stricter conditions regarding efficiency and consistency; 44. Welcomes the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking, the aim of which is to produce greener, more environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient aircraft; Financial arrangements and regional policy 45. Notes the importance of access to structural funding in the financing of energy efficiency, through bodies such as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and also through private banking schemes; 46. Calls on the Commission to raise from 3% to a minimum of 5% the proportion of structural and cohesion funding which should be spent on improving the energy efficiency of existing homes, and to require Member States to take full advantage of this opportunity; 47. Regrets the complexity of much EU funding for energy efficiency, notwithstanding the existence of the Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises Initiative (JEREMIE); notes that the lack of simple and accessible funding constitutes a
