WRITTEN QUESTION E-4706/05 by Christine De Veyrac (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (14 December 2005) Subject: Situation in Laos — aid from the European Union For the past 30 years, a Communist-inspired dictatorship has been present in Laos with all that that entails: the absence of a multiparty system, of freedom of expression, of freedom of the press, of freedom of assembly, of religious freedom, and the persecution of the ethnic Hmong, etc. Can the Commission specify the policy pursued by the European Union with regard to this situation? What is the annual amount of aid paid by the Union to Laos? Is this aid paid to public authorities or does it reach private operators directly? What has the Union received in return for its contribution, especially as regards the fate and protection of the Hmong?
