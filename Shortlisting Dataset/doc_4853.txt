Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (25 September 2008) The Commission is aware of the establishment of a growing number of environmental exclusion zones in different Member States where access by certain higher-polluting vehicles is restricted for reasons of air quality. The Commission has not, until now, been aware of major problems caused by the way in which access by vehicles from other Member States is being regulated. Solutions also differ from zone to zone and between the Member States as to how foreign vehicles are treated. The Commission understands that it is normal practice that used vehicles are sold on and continue to be used until their resale value drops below the scrap value, or until they are exported to third countries. To ensure adequate air quality throughout their territory the competent authorities in the Member States are expected, where necessary, to address all significant sources of pollution by measures set out in their air quality plans Article 23, Directive 2008/50/EC, OJ L 152, 11.6.2008. . Vehicle maintenance, inspection, scrappage schemes and retrofitting are just a few of the more widely used options addressing pollution from second-hand vehicles. In its Green Paper on urban mobility Towards a new culture for urban mobility; COM(2007)551 final; 25.9.2007. , the Commission raised a number of issues in relation to ‘Green zones’, including questions relating to guidance, free circulation and cross-border enforcement. Following the subsequent consultation on this Green Paper, the Commission is currently preparing an Action Plan on urban mobility and, in this context, is considering whether further action is desirable in relation to these issues. In the meantime, the Commission continues to monitor the situation in view of possible problems in practice linked to the operation of environmental exclusion zones.
