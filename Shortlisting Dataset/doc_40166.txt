ORAL QUESTION H-0241/02 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Antonios Trakatellis to the Commission Subject: Restructuring of Olympic Airways (OA) and the abandonment of profitable routes operated by Olympic Aviation Following the Commission's decision to launch an inquiry in Greece concerning the misuse of aid to OA, including the loan (February 2002) of EUR 19.5 million to address existing problems, the management of OA has been taking counter-productive decisions and saddling OA - which is already bankrupt - with fresh debts and jeopardising the position of its financially sound subsidiaries. OA's management has decided to abandon profitable routes linking Thessaloniki with European cities and assigned the newly acquired aircraft to domestic low-capacity destinations; there is a danger that this will result in new debts, while at the same time cutting off northern Greece and harming productive enterprises. Will the Commission say whether it intends, as part of the inquiry into the abuse of state aid and the restructuring of the company, to call for a stop to any decision or action which harms the company and leads OA to bankruptcy and its subsidiaries into debt and to examine the decision to abandon profitable routes operated by Olympic Aviation? What measures does it intend to take to ensure that the rules and guidelines governing state aid and the bailing-out and restructuring of ailing undertakings are respected and that the restructuring of OA makes progress, without harming profitable companies such as Olympic Aviation and Macedonian Airlines?
