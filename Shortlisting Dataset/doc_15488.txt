recalls that the Commission will update these figures in the traditional autumn Letter of Amendment, reflecting the state-of-play of ongoing negotiations over these agreements. Environment 50. The four key expenditure items in this area are: climate change; nature and bio-diversity; sustainable management and use of resources; environment and health. 51. The key innovation in terms of the structure of the budget in this area is that the LIFE+ Programme for 2007 - 2013 will become a single financing instrument for the environment and will replace all pre-2007 programmes. The programmed budget for LIFE+ 2007 in the PDB is EUR 241 million in commitment appropriations, according to document II of the Commission's PDB. 52. However, the Commission's PDB document I (page 23) notes that " the increase in required resources from EUR 234 million to EUR 270 million is mainly due to enlargement and ... the implementation of EU environmental policy in the new member states and ... the necessary extension of the Emission Trading Scheme ". It would be interesting to have some further explanation of which policies require the greatest additional financing in this context. Health and Consumer Protection 53. Health and consumer protection is a horizontal policy area or title within the budget. According to the Commission's PDB document II, about EUR 309 million of the overall EUR 544 million of the budget appropriations allocated to this policy area are spent within Heading 2. However, there is very little detail in the PDB 2007 about spending on health and consumer protection within Heading 2. Heading 3a - Freedom, security and justice Main figures and comparison with 2006 54. The operational expenditure in Heading 3a Freedom, Security and Justice (not to be confused with Policy Area 18 with the same name) amounts to EUR 571,3 million. The corresponding indent called "Area of Freedom, Justice and security" in the 2000 - 2006 Financial Perspective Heading "Internal Policies" amounted to 549,1 million, which would mean an increase of 4 per cent comparing B2006 to PDB 2007. But is not clear if these two figures can be compared at all as Budget 2007 will see the launch of three new framework programmes in the field of Freedom, Security and Justice: Fundamental Rights and Justice; Solidarity and Management of Migration flows; and Security and Safeguarding Liberties Reports SEGELSTRÖM ( COM(2005)0122 ), KUDRYCKA ( COM(2005)0123 ), LA RUSSA ( COM(2005)0124 ); The opinion of the Budget committee were drafted by Neena Gill, Kathelijne Buitenweg, Louis Grech, Simon Busuttil, Gerard Deprez, Yannick Vaugrenard, Ville Itälä. . 55. In any event, "ring fencing" the amounts allocated to the area of Justice, Freedom and Security in a specific subheading in the MFF marks the priority given to it and ensures increased visibility and a stable financial basis for policies as the Commission cannot easily reshuffle the budget to other policy areas. 56. The new programmes (for which direct comparison to 2006 is not possible, and so the percentage column, in particular, must be viewed with some caution) are split as follows: Table 3 PDB 2007 Framework Programme /Other Programme
