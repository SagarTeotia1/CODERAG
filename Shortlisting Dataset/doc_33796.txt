WRITTEN QUESTION P-4834/07 by Johan Van Hecke (ALDE) to the Commission (2 October 2007) Subject: Merger between Suez and Gaz de France This merger will make Suez-GdF the fourth largest energy supplier in Europe, after Gazprom, the French company EDF and the Germany company EON. At the end of 2006, the Commission approved the merger on condition that the group divested itself of a number of operations in France and Belgium. How can the Commission justify this approval when a proposal for a directive on the unbundling of energy groups is to be submitted with the aim of increasing competition and reducing energy prices? Will not this merger undermine the Commission's plans and the liberalisation of the electricity industry? From the point of view of Belgium, moreover, there are grounds for concern because as a result of the merger the French State will acquire part of Belgium's energy network. Although the merged group Suez/GdF has promised to respect all the agreements which it had entered into with the Belgian authorities, it is open to question what influence Belgium will be able to bring to bear on one of the largest energy groups in the world. The Belgian Government will apparently acquire a golden share, as will the French Government: will the Commission approve this?
