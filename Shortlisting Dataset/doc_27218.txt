Question for written answer E-011060/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Esther de Lange (PPE) (28 November 2011) Subject: African swine fever In 2011 regular outbreaks of African swine fever were reported by Russia and Armenia. The situation in Russia with regard to African swine fever is currently very alarming, partly because of problems in getting the outbreaks under control and partly because the border controls by countries bordering on Russia are not adequate or effective. There is a danger that African swine fever could spread to EU Member States. 1. What is the current situation with regard to African swine fever in countries bordering on the European Union? 2. Does the Commission share my concerns that Russia is failing to get the disease under control and that border controls by countries bordering on Russia are not adequate or effective? 3. What measures is the Commission taking, or has it taken, to prevent African swine fever from spreading to EU Member States?
