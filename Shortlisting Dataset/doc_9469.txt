WRITTEN QUESTION E-0109/10 by François Alfonsi (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (21 January 2010) Subject: Literary translations in France's regional languages I recently received an enquiry from Brittany concerning translation into Breton. I should therefore like to put a question to you that is both simple and yet means a great deal to people in Brittany: can a Breton publisher apply for funding under Strand 1.2.2 (‘Literary Translation Projects’) of the Culture Programme for the translation into Breton of a work by Shakespeare? We have read the Culture Programme guide carefully and are aware of the eligibility criteria. The June 2009 version of the guide points out that ‘eligible languages are the official languages of the countries taking part in the Programme’, and establishes that ‘official languages’ are those defined as such ‘by the Constitution or by the basic law of the respective country’. This is fine as far as Welsh, Basque or Catalan are concerned, as those languages are recognised in the basic laws of Britain and Spain respectively. It seemed that the same could not be said, however, for the regional languages of France, which, until recently, did not enjoy the same status under the French Constitution. The constitutional law adopted on 23 July 2008 modernising the institutions of the Fifth Republic inserted a new Article 75‑1 into the Constitution, stating that ‘regional languages are part of France’s heritage’. In the light of this, can we conclude that, just like their Catalan counterparts, Breton publishers could now also receive Community support under Strand 1.2.2 (‘Literary Translation Projects’) of the Culture Programme to translate a work by Shakespeare into Breton? We would be delighted to be able to inform the Breton publisher concerned of this most positive development.
