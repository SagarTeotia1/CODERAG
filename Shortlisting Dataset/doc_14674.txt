Question for written answer E-004795/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nessa Childers (S&D) (17 May 2011) Subject: Motorway safety A recent serious incident in Ireland involving two lorries, caused by poor visibility, has called attention to the fact that there are no safety measures to warn motorists of fog on motorways. Highway safety is a major concern to the public and to transportation professionals, so the number of crashes caused by poor visibility due to fog forms an alarming statistic. Drivers respond to poor visibility conditions in different ways: some slow down, others do not. Many drivers simply follow the tail lights of the vehicle ahead. Accordingly, hazardous conditions are created in which speeds are both too high for the prevailing conditions and highly variable. Does the Commission have any action plan related to this area? Has it considered taking any legislative or non-legislative action regarding increasing fog warning signs on roads? Does it have any other comments on this particular area of road safety?
