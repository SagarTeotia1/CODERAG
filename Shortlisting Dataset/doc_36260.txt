Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (21 February 2012) It is true that a package of assistance of up to EUR 20 billion was approved in 2008. However, in the end only EUR 14.3 billion were disbursed, as Hungary regained market access. Moreover, out of the EUR 5.5 billion the EU disbursed, Hungary has repaid EUR 2 billion at the end 2011. The Economic and Financial Affairs Council of 30 November 2011 agreed in principle to a second financial assistance programme. Before starting formal negotiations, Hungary will need to meet certain preconditions. In particular, Hungary must ensure full independence of its central bank. The Hungarian government is currently taking deficit-decreasing measures which remain to be assessed. If an agreement is reached over a second financial assistance package, the conditionality would necessarily include respecting the Stability and Growth Pact and may well imply further consolidation measures. EU assistance would therefore not facilitate the avoidance of austerity measures. Financial assistance from the EU to a Member State involves conditionality, i.e. a degree of influence over policy decisions. Therefore, unless the countries are in serious need, for instance because they are losing access to financial markets or fear that they will do so in the future, Member States are unlikely to follow this route while they have other options.
