2002/C 205 E/150 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0431/02 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE-DE) to the Commission (21 February 2002) Subject: Failure of programme to build marinas in Greece — problems with the tourism subprogramme of the 2nd CSF As the Commission will be aware, a decision was taken under the tourism subprogramme of the 2nd CSF to build four marinas in Greece (at Zakynthos, Ikaria, Argostoli and Thassos) with the public sector contributing 18 million euro and the private sector 13 million euro. The works commenced in 1996. One year after the start (1997), it was thought advisable to carry out a feasibility study, which showed the works were feasible. Three years after (1999), it was thought in regard to the private sector's involvement that the model used up to that point (direct intervention by EOT — the Greek National Tourism Organisation) should be changed and the services of a financial consultant engaged. The consultant was appointed, he signed a contract, requested further investment and, although he was required to present the details of the tenders to be invited from the private sector (for the exploitation of the marinas) by 7 December 2001, he has not yet done so. In the meantime, the only section of the Zakynthos marina under construction is nowhere near completion and, needless to say, there is no mention of private sector involvement. On Ikaria, one third of the budget was spent simply pouring concrete into the sea, after which the project was abandoned. On Thassos, the project was scaled down because of problems with the fuel tank, the windward jetty, the markings, etc. 1. What does the Commission intend to do to tackle these problems? 2. What is the current situation with regard to the tourism subprogramme of the 2 nd CSF in Greece?
