Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (22 June 2010) As the Honourable Member states in his question, the wetland area Quadro de Santiago in the municipality of Benicasim in the province of Castellón does not include any site of Community importance (SCI) designated under the provisions of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC Council Directive 92/43/EC, of 21 May 1992, on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206,22.7.1992. within its borders. In the same way, there are no Special Protection Areas (SPAs) designated under the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC Directive 2009/147/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 20, 26.1.2010 . , located within its limits. The Commission would outline the provisions of Article 4 of the Birds Directive, which require that Member States shall strive to avoid pollution or deterioration of bird habitats outside the protection areas, as well as the provisions contained in Article 5 concerning the requisite measures to establish a general system of protection for all species of birds included in the annex I of the directive 2009/147/EC. Member States are obliged to satisfy these provisions concerning the bird habitats that are not located within the SPAs for the conservation of bird species. Concerning the directive 97/62/EEC Council Directive 97/62/EC of 27 October 1997 adapting to technical and scientific progress Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 305, 8.11.1997 . , the Commission would outline that it adapts certain natural habitat types and species in Annexes I and II of Directive 92/43/EEC to technical and scientific progress. According to the available information, the Commission understands that the competent regional authorities have not yet taken a final decision regarding the construction of an urban development and, therefore, since due process is being followed, there are insufficient grounds to identify a breach of the EU environmental legislation at present.
