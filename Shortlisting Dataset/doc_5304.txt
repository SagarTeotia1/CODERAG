which must be placed at all bathing sites to indicate the quality of the water - in some UK beaches, a smiley system of faces to indicate good or poor quality water already exists on display boards at the beach. When the 1976 directive was adopted, the European Parliament was not elected and had little say on the content of the rules. This time round, things are different: the European Parliament now shares equal power with the Council of Ministers to decide the final text of the new directive and MEPs can genuinely claim to have achieved a stronger directive for the environment, with greater clarity of information to be made available to the general public. European Parliament amendments focused in particular on the criteria for the new 'sufficient' category, on the quality of information to the public and on emergency plans where a bathing water is classified as 'sufficient' or 'poor'. MEPs were lobbied strongly on this key piece of legislation by groups as diverse as Surfers Against Sewage, a Cornwall-based group which wanted to see the directive extended beyond bathing to other recreational activities, and WaterVoice (now the Consumer Council for Water) which represents water and sewerage customers in England and Wales - they argued that the new directive would increase water prices and still claim that up to 70 English or Welsh beaches would fail to meet the new minimum standards laid down in the directive from 2008. 20050820IPR01040 Environmental facts and figures: bathing water quality DEFRA website on the proposed change to the Bathing Water Directive Surfers Against Sewage campaign for clean, safe recreational waters, free from sewage effluents, toxic chemicals and nuclear waste.
