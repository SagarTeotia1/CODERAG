In a debate based on an oral question, followed up with a resolution, MEPs will press the Commission to take action. The threat to bees comes partly from the use of modified and treated seed, which has led to a reduction in pollen and nectar, and partly from the reduction in agricultural set-aside land. Without adequate food sources, bees are vulnerable to parasites, viruses and other diseases. Not only will the usual products of beekeepers, such as honey, be affected but more importantly without bees to pollinate plants it will be impossible to produce the same yields of crops, fruit and vegetables. In an oral question accompanied by a draft resolution, MEPs will urge the Commission to conduct research into this problem, including how far it is caused by the use of pesticides, and create ecological buffer zones. Financial aid should also be provided for beekeepers in difficulty, says the draft resolution.

Previously there were twenty-one different market organisation regimes, making the CAP unnecessarily complex. The latest reforms do not change any of the market arrangements but will simplify the regime and make it more transparent. The report on this subject was drafted for Parliament's Agriculture Committee by its chair,
