a local authority or public body situated on the territory of that Member State. It may also be the law of the Member State where the EGCC has its seat; - the modalities of mutual recognition with regard to control (Article 4(6)); in addition, the convention must be notified to all its members and to the Member States involved (Article 4(8)). Your rapporteur considers that: - Article 4(2): the Convention must specify, in particular (the list is not exhaustive) the operating principles of the EGCC , the tasks of the EGCC , its duration and the conditions for its dissolution (amendment 26); - Article 4(4): the question of the responsibilities of each of the members is adequately covered by Article 7(2) concerning the responsibilities of the Member States (amendment 28); - Article 4(6): the modalities of mutual recognition as regards the right of supervision should be specified in the text of the regulation itself, not in the convention. Your rapporteur proposes, therefore, adding a new paragraph to Article 1(3) on this subject (see amendment 16) (amendment 30); - the law applying to the EGCC should be the law governing associations in the Member State concerned (amendment 31); - Article 4(8): the Convention should also be notified to the Committee of the Regions (amendment 33). Ø The EGCC shall adopt its statutes (Article 5 of the Commission proposal) and equip itself with its own organs (Article 6 of the Commission proposal) . The EGCC always has a director. However, the EGCC is free to decide whether to equip itself with an assembly consisting of representatives of its members or of other bodies. - Your rapporteur considers that the statutes should also include provisions concerning the r epresentation of the EGCC, including an assembly consisting of representatives of its members and an executive committee (amendment 34). To that end, he proposes deleting Article 6 on the organs of the EGCC and including those provisions in the article on the statutes of the EGCC (amendment 36) . Ø The setting up of the EGCC is announced in the Official Journal of the European Union. As of that instant, the legal capacity of the EGCC is recognised in each Member State ( Article 7 of the Commission proposal) . Your rapporteur considers that, once the EGCC has been invested with legal personality in accordance with the applicable national law in the Member State concerned, the statutes setting up the EGCC should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union (amendment 37).
