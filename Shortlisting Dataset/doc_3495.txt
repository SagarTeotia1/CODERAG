this field and to give the evaluation unit the staff and powers needed to ensure that its work improves the impact and effectiveness of development aid policy; 21. With regard to comitology, agrees with the Commission that the role of the Council's working groups and committees needs to evolve so as to concentrate on political guidelines, the periodic revision of the strategies of each of the countries, sectoral strategies and issues requiring European coordination prior to international deliberations; 22. Welcomes the Commission's initiative to review all the regulations concerning development policy in order to study the feasibility of introducing a horizontal regulation making it possible to concentrate the work of the committees at the programming stage and to eliminate the systematic revision of all projects; 23. Highlights the importance of 'country strategy papers' and NIPs (National Indicative Programmes) as an instrument for promoting both complementarity with the Member States and the participation of beneficiaries in the programming of cooperation by means of dialogue and the transmission of information, thus moving towards the idea of handing over development projects to the beneficiaries where appropriate conditions obtain; 24. Stresses the need to step up the presence of the EU in fora where key issues for developing economies are debated and to improve the coordination of the positions of the Member States and the EU in the various international fora, especially the Bretton Woods institutions and the UN, where the EU's political role should be commensurate with the level of its contributions; 25. Reiterates the importance of forwarding information to the EP before policies are adopted and, in any event, at the same time as it is forwarded to the Council, with regard to Community aid policy guidelines, forecasts and programming, without this meaning that the EP should interfere with the Commission's management role; 26. Considers that an effort should be made in the new structure to ensure coherence between the Community's external, development, commercial, agricultural, fisheries, research and development and food safety and hygiene policies; considers that coherence impact assessments should be made in the formulation of all new policies and practices, in addition to the publication of the annual report, to be scrutinised by both the Council and Parliament, in line with its abovementioned resolution of 17 February 2000 on the coherence of the various Union policies; 27. Stresses that the RELEX reform process must be carried out in an open and transparent way, with the participation of the staff of the departments involved in the reform process and paying particular attention to preserving, throughout the transitional period, the objectives of an effective European development policy, as well as the commitments entered into with the beneficiary countries; 28. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
