WRITTEN QUESTION E-0859/08 by Paul van Buitenen (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (21 February 2008) Subject: OLAF preserving anonymity of Commission whistleblower In reply to parliamentary Question E‑3302/04, the Commission stated that OLAF guarantees to preserve the anonymity of a Commission official who informs OLAF of possible professional wrongdoing by other Commission officials, if this official wishes to remain anonymous. In the case of an official of the European Commission Office for Official Publications (OPOCE), the Director General of OLAF informed This is confirmed by OLAF letter No 05235 — NT/ls D(2004-AC-4575), CMS Ref.: OF/2002/0356, dated 13 April 2004, of OLAF Director-general Mr Brüner to European Commission Secretary-General Mr David O’Sullivan. the OPOCE hierarchy of the identity of a whistleblower in their office, this against the wishes of the whistleblower concerned. 1. Does the Commission acknowledge that in this case, OLAF did not respect the wish of a Commission official who had indicated that he wanted to remain anonymous to his superiors? 2. Is the Commission aware of other cases where OLAF breached the anonymity of a Commission official who informed OLAF of alleged irregularities happening in his (former) Directorate General? 3. What consequences is the Commission prepared to draw from such incidents? Since the introduction of what the Commission and OLAF call a ‘whistleblower provision’ in the EC Staff Regulations, no official whistleblower has been registered, according to OLAF activity reports. 4. How many EC officials have reported suspicions of irregularities, but preferred to remain anonymous, instead of choosing official whistleblower status? 5. Does the above not indicate that there is something wrong with the present whistleblowing arrangements? Could it be that the disclosure of the whistleblowers’ identity and the obligation to be heard by a magistrate scares people off?
