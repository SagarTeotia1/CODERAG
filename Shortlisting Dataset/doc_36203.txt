Answer given by Mr Figel' on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2008) Fostering sustainable development in all its dimensions and in particular as regards environmental education is an important priority for the Commission. Awareness of the environment and sensitivity to ecological concerns through active participation by citizens in civil society, community and political life has become a key issue in all European countries. Environmental education is largely embedded in national school curricula and in informal learning. Numerous successful projects in Member States show the significant contribution that teaching environmental issues in educational institutions can make. A wide variety of topics is being addressed, from developing and supporting environmental education programmes in schools to organising teacher training seminars, creating educational material and fostering exchange. Education can influence and help to change behaviour and it can influence children and young people to acquire participatory skills from an early age. The Commission therefore remains committed to supporting Member States in fostering Education for Sustainable Development at all levels of learning. The Commission has knowledge about the projects funded under the various actions in the Lifelong Learning Programme which supports transnational actions and exchanges of good practice, for example in the areas of prevention or awareness-raising. In order to get a better insight into topics and methodology as well as the active involvement of participants, the Commission has recently initiated a compilation of innovative best-practice examples in Education for Sustainable Development Results will be published in the second half of 2008 on the website of the Commission's Directorate-General responsible for Education, training, culture and youth. , including environmental education, throughout Member States.
