(8) In order to reflect the ▌title of this Regulation ▌and the new name of the Agency , all provisions of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 citing the previous name of the Agency should be amended . ▌ (9a) In order to ensure effectively the accomplishment of the tasks of the Agency, the Member States and the Commission should be represented on an Administrative Board entrusted with the necessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedure for decision making by the Agency, approve its work programme and appoint the Executive Director. (9b) It is also appropriate to include a representative of the European Parliament in the Agency’s Administrative Board as a non-voting member , in view of the fact that Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 highlighted the usefulness of close cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. ▌ (10) In order to ensure that the Agency accomplishes its tasks whilst respecting the Commission’s role as manager of the programmes and in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission, it is also important ▌to state explicitly that the Agency should be managed by an Executive Director under the supervision of the Administrative Board, in accordance with the guidelines provided to the Agency by the Commission .

(10b) The Agency’s Administrative Board should be empowered to take any decision which may ensure that the Agency can accomplish its tasks with the exception of the accreditation tasks, which should be entrusted to the Security Accreditation Board, and in respect of which the Administrative Board will perform its duties only in relation to resource and budget matters. Sound governance of the programmes requires also that the tasks of the Administrative Board be compliant with the new missions assigned to the Agency by virtue of Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, notably regarding the functioning of the Security Monitoring Centre and the instructions given pursuant to Council Joint Action 2004/552/CFSP of 12 July 2004 on aspects of the operation of the European satellite radio-navigation system affecting the security of
