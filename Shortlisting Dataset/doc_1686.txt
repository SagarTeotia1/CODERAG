WRITTEN QUESTION E-2247/07 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (25 April 2007) Subject: Cycle tracks The prefecture of Attiki currently only has one proper cycle track, 1200 metres in length, running along the boundaries of the municipalities of Chalandri and Vrilissia, its purpose being to make life easier for users by linking up major public transport stations (for example Attiki Odos and the underground station) and contribute towards a sustainable environment. Community funding is being provided for this purpose. Can the Commission say whether funding is being envisaged for any other such projects in Attiki? If not, will the Commission provide co-funding in future for such purposes?
