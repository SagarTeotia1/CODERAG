Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (7 July 2011) 1. A series of measures to support the beekeeping sector are set down in Council Regulation (EC) 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, Article 106 thereof. ). These measures may be included in the apiculture programmes drawn up by Member States and if considered eligible the expenditure concerned can be part-financed by the EU. Part of the expenditure is devoted to varroasis prevention and the restocking of hives. The EU contribution to the financing of the national beekeeping programmes has increased for the period 2011-13 compared to the previous period (2008‑10), from EUR 26 million to EUR 32 million per year. 2. The Commission has already designated an EU Reference Laboratory for bee health (Agence Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail (ANSES) in Sophia-Antipolis, France) from 1 April 2011.
