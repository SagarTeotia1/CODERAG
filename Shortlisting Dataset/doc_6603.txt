Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (17 May 2011) The Commission’s policy concerning non-profit distributing associations is to guarantee that they can grow and prosper alongside the traditional companies and to ensure for them a level playing field and equal footing in the implementation of all European policies. In addition, the Commission pays particular attention to ensuring that all Union legislation in areas such as freedom of establishment, competition, accounting, company law, public procurement, health, social affairs, taxation etc take into account the specific needs, particular goals, ethos and working style of this kind of legal entity. In 1992 the Commission submitted three proposals COM(1992)252; http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:1993:0252:FIN:EN:PDF to the Council for Statutes for a European Cooperative Society, a European Mutual (insurance society) and a European Association. In 2003 the Statute for a European Cooperative Council Regulation 1435/2003 on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society (SCE), OJ L 207, 18.8.2003. was adopted. The other two proposals were withdrawn in 2006 by the Commission due to lack of progress in the legislative process in the Council. On 27 October 2010, the Commission adopted the Single Market Act (SMA) COM(2010) 608 final/2. , where it recognises the necessity to improve some of the legal structures of the social economy sector. In this context the Commission will present a regulation on a European Foundation Statute by the end of 2011. The Commission also undertook to launch a study on the situation of mutuals in all Member States to examine in particular their cross-border activities. As far as the idea for a proposal for a European Association statute is concerned, and given that any proposal in this area must be adopted by unanimity, the Commission takes the view that any new initiative in this area can be undertaken at a later stage if the forthcoming draft proposal for a European Foundation receives the support of the Council.
