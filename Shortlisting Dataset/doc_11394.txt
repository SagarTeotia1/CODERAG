Question for written answer E-010800/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (20 December 2010) Subject: Mismanagement of health resources A WHO report has claimed that, on a conservative estimate, 20 to 40 % of all expenditure in the health sector is in reality wasted, the most flagrant case being waste and mismanagement in relation to medicines. The WHO proposes a greater emphasis on generics, and criticises the abuse of antibiotics. Portugal has the fifth highest health expenditure in the EU, with current expenditure on healthcare accounting for 9.4 % of GDP. 1. Is the Commission aware of these figures? What is its view on them? 2. What does the Commission believe it can do, within the limits of its powers, to reduce waste in health spending, with particular reference to medicines?
