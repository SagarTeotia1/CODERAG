WRITTEN QUESTION E-6363/07 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Council (18 December 2007) Subject: Human rights in Eritrea In the African country of Eritrea President Issaias Afeworki rules with an iron hand and human rights are violated on a massive scale. Hundreds of opposition members are at present in unknown locations and being held captive in inhumane conditions. There is no free press in Eritrea. In two resolutions ( P5_TA(2002)0070 of 7 February 2002 and P6_TA(2004)0068 of 19 November 2004), Parliament has called for the release of all political prisoners and asked the Council and Commission to initiate the procedure under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. The European Presidency has also issued two declarations to the government of Eritrea. Since then the human rights situation has barely improved, according to the human rights organisation Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Without Borders, ‘Freedom of opinion in Eritrea’, November 2007). In the Council’s view, does the current situation constitute violation of the ‘essential element’ clause in the Cotonou Agreement? If so, what steps will the Council be taking? Is the Council considering announcing a ban on entry for President Issaias Afeworki and the members of his government? If so, when? If not, what are the reasons for not doing so, and what are the differences from the Mugabe regime, on which the Council has imposed a ban on entry?
