has sometimes opted to maintain separate certain chapters and/ or lines constituting a "sub-policy", presumably for reasons of transparency. For example, chapter 19 04 (European Initiative for democracy and human rights) is maintained as a separate entity, but with the individual lines referring in their titles to the main instrument to which they "belong". As an example, budget line 19 04 02 01 is now titled "Human Rights and democracy - Activities under the.......Neighbourhood Policy Instrument" 68. The Commission is generally proposing to keep separate the major geographical regions. But this is not normally the case for countries, and a few thematic policies. In some cases, visibility has disappeared. It is for example no longer possible to see from the PDB how much assistance is budgeted for Iraq or Afghanistan. 69. Overall, commitment appropriations are proposed at EUR 6,7 billion compared to EUR 8,4 billion in B2006 (-20,2%). The difference of EUR 1,7 can be accounted for by the appropriations for Bulgaria and Romania (heading 7 in 2006 budget) which are now budgeted under the internal headings (to much higher amounts) in line with a foreseen accession on 1 January 2007. Payments for the heading overall are budgeted at EUR 7, 4 billion, a decrease of 13, 8%. Having eliminated the effect of the transfer of Bulgaria and Romania, the heading as a whole is therefore practically +/- 0 on 2006. But, the picture is more complicated. 70. Funds for the Guarantee Fund (200m) are now included under heading 4 whereas they were under Heading 6 in the 2000 - 2006 financial perspective. They must be financed under the ceiling (200 m less space for other policies compared to 2006). The Emergency Aid reserve (234,5m) is included in the overall figure for Heading 4 but will be financed (if mobilised) outside the ceiling. There is therefore no effect on the space remaining for other policies. This also explains why there is an overall margin of EUR 110 million, although total commitments are actually 125 million higher than the ceiling. Funds for Northern Cyprus are no longer in the PDB and international fisheries agreements have been transferred to heading 2. External relations 71. This area as a whole remains virtually unchanged at EUR 3,41 billion (-0, 71%). European Neighbourhood Policy and relations with Russia is budgeted at EUR 1,34 billion, +8% compared to 2006. Separate budget lines are maintained on a geographical basis for Mediterranean countries EUR 750m (- 0,7% on 2006), Eastern Europe at EUR 367m (+ 0,7 % on 2006) as well as for financial assistance to Palestine and the peace process at EUR 158 m (+ 34,8 %). The rapporteur asks the Commission to confirm whether this amount contains all amounts for Palestine, including the aid that was financed from the MEDA line in previous years. 72. Latin America sees a marginal increase in the PDB at EUR 326m compared to 318m in B2006. Relations with Asia, Central Asia and east of Jordan countries : appropriations fall from EUR 1 084 million in B2006 to 771 million in the PDB.
