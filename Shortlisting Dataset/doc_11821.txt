WRITTEN QUESTION E-0279/10 by Nuno Melo (PPE) to the Council (5 February 2010) Subject: Return of killer mines in Angola Three children were recently killed and another two injured when an abandoned landmine exploded in Angola, one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. This incident occurred last Thursday in the locality of Djakala (Lunda Norte province), but has only now been publicised. Every year, Angola receives, for purposes of tourism, professional activity or investment, hundreds of thousands of visitors from the EU, especially Portuguese citizens. 1. Is the Council aware of the presence of mines on Angolan territory? 2. Does any mutual aid agreement exist between the EU and Angola for purposes of eliminating landmines? 3. Is there any proposal for informing EU citizens visiting Angola or resident there with regard to this problem?
