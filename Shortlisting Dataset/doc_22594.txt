WRITTEN QUESTION E-5426/07 by Sophia in 't Veld (ALDE) and Marco Cappato (ALDE) to the Commission (6 November 2007) Subject: Directive 2004/38/EC and sexual orientation discrimination In its answers to Questions E‑2820/07 and E‑2822/07, the Commission has illustrated that, under Directive 2004/38/EC OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77. : — the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom recognise registered partnerships as equivalent to marriage for the purposes of free movement; — Belgium and Luxembourg have not yet transposed the directive, while no information is available at the moment for Bulgaria and Romania. — the remaining Member States That is to say: Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Latvia, Ireland, Greece, Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Slovenia, France, Hungary, Poland. do not recognise registered partnerships as equivalent to marriage for the purposes of free movement under the directive. — France, by not recognising UK registered partnerships, does infringe Community law, with regard to the procedural safeguards of Article 3(2) of the directive, providing for an obligation to facilitate entry and residence of registered partners, to carry out an extensive examination and to justify refusals. — The Commission has no detailed information on how this article is applied in practice. Will the Commission carry out an enquiry, gather detailed information and take action towards Member States' governments to ensure that the procedural safeguards provided in Article 3(2) of the directive are properly implemented? Will it take action towards notably the French, German and Hungarian authorities in order to ensure that — since they have laws providing for registered partnership — they recognise other Member States' registered partnerships for purposes of free movement?
