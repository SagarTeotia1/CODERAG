(d) clearly defined sanctions (reduction or suspension of payments) in cases where the agreed reform measures are not complied with; 22. Makes its approval of the proposed new arrangements conditional upon the relevant criteria and procedures being transparent and understandable not only for the public in the European Union but also in the beneficiary countries and there being unrestricted access to the evaluation and audit reports subsequently drawn up as this is the only way of ensuring effective monitoring of results; 23. Calls on the Commission to strengthen its delegations in the beneficiary countries accordingly, to improve perceptibly the monitoring and audit capacity available for EuropeAid and, where necessary, to submit to the budgetary authority appropriate proposals for the deployment of additional resources and staff; 24. Points out that devolving greater responsibilities to the Commission delegations provides an opportunity to create a system for the management of development projects that is adapted to local conditions and will permit the greatest possible involvement of the beneficiaries; 25. Asks the Commission not to make any further financial commitments to organisations which could themselves or whose staff could escape prosecution by claiming diplomatic immunity in the event of any offences against the criminal or labour law of the host country; 26. In view of the problems that have arisen in this discharge procedure, draws attention to Rule 3 of its Rules of Procedure, which entitles Members to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, excluding only Members' personal files and accounts, but not excluding confidential documents forwarded by the Commission; 27. Draws attention to the procedure laid down in Annex VII of its Rules of Procedure which applies to all confidential documents forwarded to Parliament and which entitles all committee members to examine these confidential documents; 28. Draws attention to Annex VI of its Rules of Procedure, under which the Committee on Budgetary Control is responsible for examining confidential documents concerning areas within its remit, having full regard for the provisions of Annex VII; 29. Instructs its President and the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control to ensure that in future documents forwarded by the Commission within the framework of discharge procedures can be examined by all Members in full compliance with the provisions of the Rules of Procedure and that any provisions of the Framework Agreement of 5 July 2000 that might preclude this are no longer applied; 30. Reaffirms its view that the present situation, in which the European Parliament is called upon to take an annual discharge decision in respect of the EDF without having corresponding budgetary and legislative powers, is an anomaly; calls once again for EDF resources to be included in the development cooperation section of the general budget of the European Communities. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT On 4 April 2001, on a proposal from its Committee on Budgetary Control, the European Parliament postponed the discharge for implementation of the sixth, seven and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year European Parliament resolution on the discharge in respect of implementation of the sixth, seven and eighth European
