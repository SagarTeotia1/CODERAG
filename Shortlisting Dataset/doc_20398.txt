Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (29 June 2006) The Polish authorities have sent two letters to the Commission, dated 4 April 2006 and 24 April 2006, explaining that Poland experienced delays in printing graphical materials, and requested a derogation from Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, OJ L 141, 30.4.2004. concerning reductions in the case of late submission of aid applications. Poland also requested extension of the deadline for submitting aid applications until the 30 June 2006 in the first letter, and until the 15 June 2006 in the second letter. After the meeting of the Member of the Commission responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development with the Polish Minister for Agriculture Andrzej Lepper on 22 May 2006 in the framework of the Council, a positive reply to this request has been issued and it has been indicated that farmers' rights to the integral granting of the aid should not be jeopardised due to circumstances that are out of their control. Therefore, on the basis of the factual information communicated by the Polish authorities to the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, a regulation providing for derogation for Poland from applying the reductions of payments of 1 % per working day due to late submission of applications until 15 June 2006 has been prepared and voted in favour at the Management Committee for Direct Payments of 14 June 2006.
