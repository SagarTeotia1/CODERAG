Question for written answer E-8691/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (26 October 2010) Subject: Treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CNL) (no prior evaluation) It has been reported that an active substance (nilotinib), indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia, in the chronic or accelerated phase, in adults resistant to, or intolerant of, the earlier therapy, has not been evaluated with a view to hospital use in Portugal. Infarmed (the Portuguese regulatory authority for medicines and health products) takes the view that dasatinib and nilotinib are in overall therapeutic terms equivalent substances where patients resistant to imatinib are concerned and to that extent supports the provisional evaluation by NICE (the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence). Given that the two active substances (nilotinib and dasatinib) have the same therapeutic indications in all of the EU Member States and are therapeutically equivalent in terms of their efficacy and safety profiles (nilotinib has been approved in 82 countries — including all Member States — and marketed in 52), this situation is surprising. Once again, Portuguese patients are being denied an efficacious therapeutic alternative which is available in the rest of Europe and which could, in this specific instance, foster natural competition in the sector (this is not happening at the present time), leading to obvious direct benefits for hospitals and a possible saving for the Ministry of Health, since daily treatment with nilotinib (EUR 129) costs less than treatment with dasatinib (EUR 129.2). (i) Novel medicines such as the one concerned here have a key role to play in therapeutics and the treatment of persons with cancer; (ii) Directive 2001/83/EC lays down the centralised marketing authorisation (MA) procedure applying to medicines in all parts of the Community; (iii) by virtue of Article 6 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, protecting and improving human health is a matter falling within the EU’s sphere of responsibility. Bearing those points in mind, — What comments does the Commission have to make about the above situation? Does it not think it possible that the rules on competition are in this case being undermined in such a way as to favour one company at the expense of the rest, thus creating a monopoly? — What can the Commission do to ensure that there is competition on the market?
