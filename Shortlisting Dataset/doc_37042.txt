Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2010) The Commission is perfectly conscious of the sensitivity of sugar in the overall context of our international negotiations. This is respected by the fact that the concessions the EU has offered to both Colombia and Peru are limited to the opening of quotas. These concessions were deemed necessary in order to achieve a balanced agreement respecting the interests of all Parties to the negotiation and remain limited in terms of volume. The automatic yearly increase of 3 % is calculated on the basis of the initial volume of the quotas opened, and not on the basis of the quota opened from one year to the following one. It will thus remain marginal in time. The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that triangular trade for sugar or swaps between imports and national production is undesirable. The Commission looked into ways to address this issue. In the case of Colombia and Peru, it recognised the legitimate expectation of our partners in looking for the improvement of the current conditions for access to the EU sugar market, as both countries have a clear production and export potential. The Commission believes that, alongside strict rules of origin, it can foster an effective development of a genuine sector in those countries precisely by ensuring in our agreements that they can predictably and constantly fill the quota we will grant. It is therefore confident that the future trade agreement will not constitute an incentive to triangular trade.
