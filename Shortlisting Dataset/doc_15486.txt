2000-2006 programmes will be a main objective. DG Regional Policy will continue the implementation of 2000-2006 European Regional Development programmes (around 380 programmes and 215 major projects) and Cohesion Fund projects. The payment of these programmes will last until the end of 2008, and the related reporting until 2010. Heading 2 - Preservation and management of natural resources 38. This heading covers most of the spending in the policy areas of agriculture, fisheries and environment and a large chunk of the money allocated to health and consumer protection. As such, Heading 2 is the largest heading in the PDB 2007 in money terms. Overall commitments (EUR 57 218 million) and payments (EUR 55 683 million) change little relative to B2006: the respective percentage increases are +1,2% for commitments and +0,4% for payments. There are, however, some significant changes beneath these headline figures. 39. A large proportion of the spending within this heading is of a compulsory nature, on which the Council has the final say in the annual budget procedure. A cursory analysis, by budget line, conducted by the Parliament's services indicates that about 78,25 % of requested spending under heading 2 in PDB 2007 is of a compulsory nature. Further analysis will be required to set out precisely where the Parliament has greatest political purchase within this heading, but it is not accurate to say that all spending under Heading 2 is "compulsory". 40. The overall margin under this heading between the MFF ceiling and 2007 commitments is EUR 1 113 million. If the Commission wishes to exceed this level, or if it wishes to modify the PDB in a major way during the course of the year due to market development, then it would need to present an amending letter. Agricultural expenditure 41. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has undergone significant changes in recent years to shift support to farmers towards direct payments and away from the most market-distorting measures. The structure of spending on agriculture has changed in significant ways. The Commission notes in the PDB that 90% of direct payments to farmers are now de-coupled from production. 42. However, the aggregate figures remain very large. In its PDB document II, which analyses proposed spending by policy area, the Commission states that (page 21) intervention in agricultural markets (chapter 02) and direct payments (chapter 03) is projected to account for EUR 43,7 billion in appropriations in total. This is 35% of overall appropriations in PDB 2007. Rural development (chapter 04) accounts for a further EUR 12,3 billion in appropriations. These three chapters account for virtually all spending within the PDB 2007 title 05: agriculture and rural development. 43. Interestingly, and in line with the shift from market intervention towards direct aids, the percentage decrease in appropriations for interventions in agricultural markets (chapter 02) is very significant between B2006 and PDB 2007: a reduction of almost one-third from EUR 8 508 million to EUR 5 698 million. The Commission states in the PDB that this is mainly due to changes in the market arrangements for milk and sugar. However, this
