Question for written answer E-002566/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Zigmantas Balčytis (S&D) (6 March 2012) Subject: Involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises in public procurement Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are regarded as the backbone of the European economy, and they have a huge potential for job creation, growth and innovation. Better access for SMEs to procurement markets would enable them to unlock this potential. It is very important to make it easier for SMEs to participate in public procurement procedures. In order to promote progressive and sustainable public procurement growth, the rules need to be simplified, made more efficient, effective and better suited to deal with the evolving political, social and economic context. Streamlined and more-efficient procedures will benefit all economic operators. One of the main projects of the second pillar of the strategy for the Baltic Sea Region is to ‘make the most of the European Code of Best Practices Facilitating Access by SMEs to Public Procurement’. I would like to ask the Commission what results have been achieved using the opportunities provided by the European Code of Best Practices to remove barriers to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? What specific measures are being taken to make public contracts more accessible to SMEs? Which countries are involved in the implementation of this project?
