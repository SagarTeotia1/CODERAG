WRITTEN QUESTION P-2562/07 by Elisabeth Schroedter (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (14 May 2007) Subject: Approval of Germany's national strategic framework plan Alongside the general principle of non-discrimination, Article 16(2) of the EU Structural Fund regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 25. of 11 July 2006, specifically cites disabled access as one of the criteria to be taken into account when drawing up projects to be co-financed using Structural Fund appropriations and throughout the implementation of such projects. However, the national strategic framework plan (NSFP) for the use of EU Structural Fund resources in the Federal Republic of Germany over the period 2007‑13, as submitted by the Federal German Government to the Commission, makes no reference to this criterion of disabled access. Paragraph 3.4.2 merely cites the general principle of non-discrimination of grounds of sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or ideology, disability, age or sexual orientation. On 2 May 2007 Commissioner Danuta Hübner informed Parliament’s Committee on Regional Policy that the Federal Republic of Germany’s NSFP had been approved by the Commission and would be officially submitted on 9 May 2007. 1. Has Germany given the Commission a reason why it failed to incorporate into its NSFP the criterion of disabled access cited in Article 16(2) of the Structural Fund regulation ? 2. When considering the NSFP, did the Commission draw attention to the omission of this criterion, and if so, did it call for that omission to be put right and was the NSFP then changed? 3. Does the Commission take the view that in the absence of this criterion of ‘disabled access’ the NSFP is consistent with the requirements of the Structural Fund regulation and can be approved?
