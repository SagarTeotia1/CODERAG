Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (27 February 2012) On 30 November 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a ‘Council Regulation on the Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (2014-2018) complementing the Horizon 2020 proposals’ COM(2011) 812. concerning research activities in nuclear energy (fusion and fission) and radiation protection. One of the objectives of this programme is to ‘move towards demonstration of feasibility of fusion as a power source by exploiting existing and future fusion facilities’ (Title I, Art. 3.2(e)). The Commission is involving external experts and principal stakeholders in the strategic planning of the future European fusion research programme. An independent panel was asked, in 2011, to review the proposed ‘strategic orientation of the EU fusion programme’, a document outlining the future directions of the fusion programme to assist in the preparation of the Commission proposal for Horizon 2020. In agreement with the conclusions of this panel, the Commission will initiate discussions with its international partners on possible cooperation to prepare for ITER operation, which will take into consideration the exploitation of JET http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/JET.aspx , JT60-SA http://www.jt60sa.org/b/index.htm (under the Broader Approach Agreement with Japan) and possible future facilities, of which FAST may be one option provided it can fit into this wider collaboration of fusion devices. However, it is not possible today to anticipate the conclusions of these deliberations.
