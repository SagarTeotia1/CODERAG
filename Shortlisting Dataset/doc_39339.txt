[ "A New Black Poet - Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, also known simply as Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, is the debut album of recording artist Gil Scott-Heron, released in 1970 on Flying Dutchman Records.", " Recording sessions for the album were originally said to have taken place live at a New York nightclub located on the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue, but liner notes included in the 2012 box set \"The Revolution Begins: The Flying Dutchman Masters\", Scott-Heron himself insists that a small audience was brought to 'the studio' and seated on 'folding chairs'.", " By the time of the recordings, Scott-Heron had published a volume of poetry and his first novel, \"The Vulture\".", " Well received by music critics who found Scott-Heron's material imaginative, \"Small Talk at 125th and Lenox\" has been described as \"a volcanic upheaval of intellectualism and social critique\" by Allmusic editor John Bush." ] ] ] }
