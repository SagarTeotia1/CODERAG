Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (29 April 2005) The infringement procedure (case 1999/0350) against Belgium for non-communication of transposition measures of Directive 97/11/CE Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 amending Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive reached the stage of a reasoned opinion under Article 228 of the EC Treaty (concerning only the Flemish region). The Directive has now been transposed and therefore the related non-communication case will be closed at one of the next Commission meetings. The Commission is currently investigating the conformity of the transposition measures with the requirements of the Directive. Should this investigation identify shortcomings in the transposition, the Commission will open an own initiative case for non-conformity of the national legislation with the Directive. In accordance with Article 1 of the EIA Directive, the Directive applies to the assessment of the environmental effects of those public and private projects which are likely to have significant effects on the environment. According to Article 2, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment should be made subject to an assessment with regard to their effects. It is the Commission’s opinion that the operation of ports and airports cannot be considered as ‘projects’ within the meaning of Article 1 of the EIA Directive. As regards Directive 2001/42/CE of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the Commission has sent a letter of formal notice on 15 December 2004 to Belgium for non-communication of national transposition of measures (case 2004/0398).
