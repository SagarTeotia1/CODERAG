of the Commonwealth since 1 September 1991. At his installation as Chief Rabbi, Dr Sacks set out his vision of a reinvigorated Anglo-Jewry and launched it with a Decade of Jewish Renewal, followed by a series of innovative communal projects. In 1995, he received the Jerusalem Prize for his contribution to diaspora Jewish life. In September 2001 he began his second decade of office with a call to Jewish Responsibility and a renewed commitment to the ethical dimension of Judaism. Covenantal relationships In a widely publicised speech given in London in July 2008, the Chief Rabbi spoke of the importance of "covenants", which he defined as "arenas of cooperation" between individuals. As examples of "covenantal goods" he cited love, friendship and influence, "things that only exist by the virtue of sharing". These could be contrasted with power and wealth, which he described as "arenas of competition" or a zero-sum game, since if a person shares his wealth or power he surrenders a part of those things. Love, friendship and influence, however are not diminished by being shared; indeed they only exist through sharing. According to Dr Sacks, "If there is only competition and not co-operation, if there is only the state and the market and no covenantal relationships, society will not survive." He attributed the problems of modern society - from marriage breakdown through depression to drug abuse and violence - to a decline in the social, or covenantal, bonds that were traditionally underpinned by religion.

On the whole, the Committee on Legal Affairs supports the proposal, which is aimed at diminishing administrative burdens and, in turn, boosting competitiveness in the economies of Member States. Amendments to clarify points in the proposal The objective of the Commission proposal is to remove additional publications requirements in national law that cause additional costs to companies. The proposed amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs clarify the practical implementation of the provisions related to the publication costs and translation provisions. The report also introduces one technical amendment in order to ensure a correct cross-referencing with the Second company law Directive (77/91/EEC). Reducing the burden of publishing requirements The Commission considered four options to diminish administrative burdens relating to publishing requirements. The Committee on Legal Affairs considers the adoption by Member States of an electronic platform, which contains full information or provides access to this information in the companies' electronic file in the register,
