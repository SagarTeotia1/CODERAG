Question for written answer E-001695/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (13 February 2012) Subject: Public child protection institutions in Greece The Greek Ombudsman estimates that, today, in the midst of the economic crisis, there are as many as 2 500 children are being cared for by public child protection institutions or private care facilities, such as those of NGOs and the Church. The phenomenon of inadequate childcare in Greece has assumed unprecedented proportions, aggravated by cuts in resources that threaten the continued operation of these facilities. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Does it have at its disposal any instruments for use by Member States, especially those in the most difficult economic circumstances, in order to support those groups of children which are particularly vulnerable to the economic crisis (e.g. children from poor families, children with special needs)? 2. Are public child protection institutions in Greece eligible for funding from the European Structural Funds? Is the country adequately utilising resources for this purpose?
