Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (12 March 2012) The Commission has addressed a letter of formal notice to Hungary pursuant to Article 258(1) TFEU concerning certain measures affecting the independence of the central bank. This is the first step in an infringement procedure. In the meantime, the Hungarian government has sent its reply and Commission services are assessing it. Within the framework of an infringement procedure, the Commission has no right to impose sanctions on Member States. According to Article 260(2) TFEU, the right to impose a lump sum or penalty payment on a Member State which has not taken the necessary measures to comply with a judgment of the Court of Justice lies exclusively with the Court.
