as the fact that the features are inhalation, dermal and other routes of exposure; stresses that the relevant legislation has to take into account the categories of people at risk as well as the risks related to these categories; 7. ¨Calls on the Commission to review all relevant legislation within two years to implement the principle "no data, no market" for all applications of nanomaterials in products with potential health, environmental or safety impacts over their life cycle, and to ensure that legislative provisions and instruments of implementation reflect the particular features of nanomaterials to which workers, consumers and/or the environment may be exposed; 8. Stresses that such review is not only necessary to adequately protect human health and the environment, but also to provide certainty and predictability to economic operators as well as public confidence; 9. Calls for the introduction of a comprehensive science-based definition of nanomaterials in Community legislation as part of nano-specific amendments to relevant horizontal and sectoral legislation; 10. Calls on the Commission to promote the adoption of a harmonised definition of nanomaterials at the international level and to adapt the relevant European legislative framework accordingly, 11. Considers it particularly important to address nanomaterials explicitly within the scope of at least legislation on chemicals (REACH, biocides), food (foodstuffs, food additives, food and feed products from genetically modified organisms), relevant legislation on worker protection, as well as legislation on air quality, water quality and waste; 12. Considers that products containing nanomaterials that present a risk to human health due to exposure of workers or consumers or an unacceptable risk for the environment should not be placed on the market; 13. Calls for the application of a "duty of care" for manufacturers that wish to place nanomaterials onto the market; 14. Calls specifically for amendments to REACH that ensure the following not later than 18 months after entry into force: – simplified registration for nanomaterials manufactured or imported (with a threshold based on for instance surface activity instead of tonnage), providing core data on physico-chemical properties as well as toxicological and ecotoxicological effects, – a chemical safety report with exposure assessment for all registered nanomaterials irrespective of hazard identification, – notification requirements for all nanomaterials placed on the market on their own, in preparations or in articles irrespective of tonnage and concentration thresholds; 15. Asks that when a substance has already been covered by Community legislation and there has been a significant change in the production methods, source materials or particle size through nanotechnology, the substance prepared by those new methods or materials be considered as a different substance, and a new entry in the Community legislation or change in the specifications on how the substance may be used shall be required before it may be placed on the market. 16. Calls specifically for amendments to waste legislation to adequately address nanomaterials, such as: – a separate entry for nanomaterials in the list of waste established by Decision 2000/532/EC Commission Decision of 3 May 2000 replacing Decision 94/3/EC establishing a list of wastes pursuant to Article 1(a) of Council Directive
