Question for written answer E-011500/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marek Józef Gróbarczyk (ECR) (7 December 2011) Subject: Recreational salmon fishing in the Baltic Sea The recent Commission proposal on a multiannual plan for the Baltic salmon stock and the fisheries exploiting that stock (COM(2011) 0470) seeks to tighten up controls in order to combat illegal salmon fishing. Scientific research shows that recreational fishing is having an increasingly significant impact on salmon stocks in the Baltic. In its multiannual plan for salmon stocks, the Commission states its intention of stepping up controls on this type of fishing. In this connection, I should like to put the following questions concerning the current rules on recreational salmon fishing in the Baltic: 1. What fishing gears and fishing methods are permissible for recreational salmon fishing in the Baltic Sea under existing law? Is this matter regulated solely at EU level or also at national level? 2. How does the law approach the issue of the granting of permission for recreational salmon fishing in the Baltic? Are any fishing permits required? Is the granting of fishing permits regulated solely by EC law or also by national law? 3. Does the EU conduct any checks on recreational fishing in the Baltic? If so, how exactly?
