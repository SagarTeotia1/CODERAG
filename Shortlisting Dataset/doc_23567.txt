WRITTEN QUESTION P-4837/08 by Jörg Leichtfried (PSE) to the Commission (8 September 2008) Subject: Refusal of Ryanair to pay costs On 14 August 2008 the departure time of a Ryanair flight from Salzburg to London Stanstead which was supposed to leave at 9.55 p.m. was first delayed by an hour, then, after all passengers had boarded the aircraft, postponed until the following day. Passengers were informed that they could either accept a refund of the ticket price or book a hotel at Ryanair's expense. They received a list of hotels and an information leaflet pointing out passengers' rights in the event of a flight being delayed or cancelled (Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 OJ L 46, 17.2.2004, p. 1 . ). One passenger decided to book a hotel, thereby incurring additional costs for an overnight stay in a hotel, the taxi ride to and from the hotel and the cancellation costs of a hotel in London. However, when he applied to Ryanair to refund the additional costs, the airline refused to pay, without giving any precise reasons for its decision. In accordance with Article 6(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, in the event of the postponement of a flight until the following day, Article 9(1)(b) and (c), which provides for the refund of hotel and transfer costs, applies. Ryanair's refusal to pay is thus a contravention of current EC law. Will the Commission say: 1. Is it aware of this case? 2. What does it intend to do in this particular case in order to protect citizens' rights?
