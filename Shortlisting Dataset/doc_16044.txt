Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2009) In connection with the development of the rail track between Halle (Saale) and Hannover by the Deutsche Bahn AG and the development of the station Ilsenburg in Saxony-Anhalt, as well as the decision of the Deutsche Bahn AG to build elevators for persons with disabilities, the Honourable Member asks three questions which the Commission answers as follows: 1. The project is part of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Federal Transport Programme 2000‑06. The selection, grant and execution of projects within the framework of Regional Policy operational programmes are carried out in a decentralised manner within the responsibility of the respective managing authority. In the case of the project ‘Station Ilsenburg’ this is the Federal Ministry for Transport, Building and Urban Development (Unit A 22). The Land of Saxony-Anhalt does not therefore take part in the management of this project. 2. Article 1 last paragraph of the General Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the structural funds for the period 2000‑06, provides inter alia for the elimination of inequalities. For the 2007‑13 period, Article 16 of general Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 refers in its second paragraph: ‘In particular, accessibility for disabled persons shall be one of the criteria to be observed in defining operations co-financed by the Funds and to be taken into account during the various stages of implementation’. The Managing Authorities of the ERDF-Programmes must therefore take this into account in individual co financed projects. 3. In this particular project, the managing authority has confirmed that the ERDF will be used for the construction of elevators, thus meeting the objective of accessibility in public transport for persons with disability.
