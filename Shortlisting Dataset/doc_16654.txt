Answer given by Mrs Grybauskaitė on behalf of the Commission (21 March 2006) EU research and technological development (RTD) projects are carried out according to the provisions of an agreement signed by both parties (the Commission and the beneficiary) which contain detailed information on the management of the project, including auditing work if need be. The audits to which the Honourable Member is referring concern RTD projects for which CINAR Ltd was unable to provide sufficient justification for certain expenditure claims considered ineligible by the relevant Commission services. As a result, the Commission was bound to recover the undue payments and launched the usual procedure. The Commission gave a full explanation to CINAR Ltd during this process and also informed the Ombudsman as this case had been brought to his attention. It should also be noted that any legal action envisaged by CINAR Ltd falls under its own responsibility and that recovery procedures are not suspended by a complaint to the Ombudsman.
