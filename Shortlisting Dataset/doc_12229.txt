Although our loan systems in Europe are based on sounder guarantees, there is a possibility that the housing bubble will burst, thus destabilising our banking systems, particularly in Spain and the United Kingdom. What action does the Commission intend to take in respect of the mortgage policies pursued in the Member States? Furthermore, housing prices (in both sales and rental markets) have risen to such an extent over recent years that many families have been forced to take out extremely large loans (the indebtedness of Spanish households has risen from 68% of their disposable income in 2000 to 110% today) or are unable to find decent housing. What action has the Commission taken in response to the request made by Parliament in the Andria report for a study on the cost of and demand for housing? Report 2006/2108(INI) on housing and regional policy.
