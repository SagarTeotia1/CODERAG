Question for written answer E-012528/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kay Swinburne (ECR) (12 January 2012) Subject: Chip Authentication Programme I have been contacted by a number of constituents on the issue of Chip Authentication Programme devices (Chip and Pin readers) and the added value to consumers. Can the Commission clarify whether it would be sensible to harmonise these devices in a similar way to the recent harmonisation of mobile phone chargers?
