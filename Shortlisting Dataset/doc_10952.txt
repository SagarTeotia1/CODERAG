Question for written answer E-4865/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) (2 July 2010) Subject: Calculating anchovy quotas in the Bay of Biscay On 2 June, the Commission replied to a question regarding the withdrawal of the report on the proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock (COM(2009)0399). Of the four questions I put to the Commission, one specifically concerned the procedure, criteria and mechanisms which are going to be used to calculate the anchovy catch quotas while waiting for the final adoption of the plan. Specifically, I wanted to know whether the formula that would be used would be the one featured in the draft Directive, agreed on by the industry, and adopted in a guideline vote last December by the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries. Despite the very specific nature of the question, the reply was to the effect that with regard to establishing fishing quotas while the management plan is being adopted, the Council recalls that, in accordance with Article 43.3 of the TFEU, the latter shall be adopted by the Council, on a proposal from the Commission. Given that my question was quite clearly not who was going to take this decision, but how the decision was going to be taken, I now reformulate my question as follows: How does the Commission intend to propose the catch quotas while the management plan is being adopted? Will the calculation formula that appears in the text adopted by the Committee on Fisheries be valid for that purpose?
