Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (30 October 2009) In its forthcoming implementing Regulations on technical measures for North western and South western waters, the Commission intends to propose that it will be permitted to deploy gillnets with a mesh size greater than 100 mm and less than 130 mm in ICES areas Vb, Via, VIb, VIIbcjk and XII (east of 27°) in waters of more than 200 meters chartered depth and less than 600 metres chartered depth. This proposal is based on scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries and should be adopted in December 2009.
