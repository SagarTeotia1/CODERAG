Supplementary answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (1 February 2008) The basis for the Honourable Member's question seems to be the warning given to Romania by the Member of the Commission responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development at the beginning of October 2007 that the Commission would apply the safeguard mechanism provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1423/2006 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1423/2006 of 26 September 2006 establishing a mechanism for appropriate measures in the field of agricultural spending in respect of Bulgaria and Romania, OJ L 269, 28.9.2006. in respect of agricultural payments to that Member State. The problems in Romania for which the application of the mechanism would be required concerned notably software problems within the paying agencies. In the meantime, an independent expert body has produced an interim and a final report, sent to the Commission on 15 December 2007, confirming that the outstanding problems have largely been solved. There are still outstanding issues with which Romania has to deal quickly but the situation is no longer of such a nature that the elements necessary to ensure the correct payment of the aid are so seriously deficient that they affect the proper functioning of the system. For this reason, the procedure leading to the application of the safeguard mechanism has been stopped. It has to be observed that if the safeguard mechanism had been applied, no money would have been lost for the Romanian agricultural community as the mechanism only works in the relation between the Member State and the Commission. The Commission would, on a provisional basis, have reduced its reimbursement to Romania by 25 % but the Romanian beneficiaries of agricultural aid would still have been entitled to receive the full amount from the Romanian authorities. Furthermore, it has to be remarked that even under the application of the safeguard mechanism, Romania would not have become a net contributor to the Community budget but would have remained a net receiver.
