Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2012) The government deficit figures used for the assessment of Greece's entry to the eurozone were those reported by Greece to the Commission at end-February 2000. The data were compiled by the National Statistical Service of Greece. In November 2004, the Commission (Eurostat) published a detailed report on the revisions to the Greek Government deficit and debt figures for the period 1997-2003 after the initiative taken by the then Greek Government in spring 2004 to launch a thorough fiscal audit with the cooperation of Eurostat http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=GREECE .
