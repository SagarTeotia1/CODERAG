Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (15 April 2005) Member States must exercise competency in the area of taxation in a manner that is consistent with Community law. The selective tax measure in favour of Exempt Companies in Gibraltar constituted State aid in the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. The purpose of the action against this measure was to put an end to this distortion of competition. The case of money laundering to which the Honourable Member refers, seems to concern criminal activities that fall under the national competency and cannot justify an action by the Commission under the competition rules. The deadline of 2010 for abolishing the Exempt Companies scheme was proposed in conformity with other similar cases. Since the United Kingdom has accepted the Commission proposal, these conditions are now binding.
