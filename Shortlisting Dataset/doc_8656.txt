WRITTEN QUESTION E-1419/10 by Hans-Peter Martin (NI) to the Commission (11 March 2010) Subject: Free trade agreement with Colombia The European Union is planning to conclude a free trade agreement with Colombia. However, Colombia is a state in which human rights are violated on a considerable scale. It is the most dangerous country in the world for trade unionists: a lack of legal certainty, state repression and targeted attacks on people's lives by paramilitaries or guerrillas are part of the daily lives of those who represent the interests of employees. In 2008 49 trade union members were murdered in Colombia. The US Congress and the Canadian Parliament recently halted ratification of similar agreements because of the poor human rights situation. The Norwegian Parliament and the Norwegian Government have also refused to ratify an EFTA free trade agreement with Colombia. What is the Commission's assessment of the human rights situation in Colombia? Does respect for human rights form part and/or is it a condition of the Commission's negotiations on a free trade agreement with Colombia? How does the Commission see the danger that such an agreement will legitimise the current policy of the Colombian Government and as a result there will be no improvement in the human rights situation?
