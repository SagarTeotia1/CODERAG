ORAL QUESTION H-0333/05 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Johan Van Hecke to the Commission Subject: European support for fair trade products Recently a number of Belgian non-governmental organisations have launched the ‘Ik ben verkocht’ (I’m being sold) campaign to raise awareness of fair trade among the Belgian public and politicians. The sale of fair trade products directly supports small and medium-sized producer groups in the South and offers them new opportunities for economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development. What steps has the Commission already undertaken to stimulate production, availability and sales of these products? Does the Commission plan to introduce European rules and standards (e.g. traceability, quality requirements), as has already been done in the case of organic products?
