Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (12 April 2011) The Commission has contributed to setting out a comprehensive response to the crisis, including measures to stabilise the financial sector, a permanent crisis resolution mechanism, strengthened legal framework for economic governance and stronger fiscal consolidation. In addition, the Commission in March 2010 proposed the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth COM(2010)2020 final. , which was endorsed by the European Council. The Member States are in the process of setting targets in the key areas of employment, innovation, education, energy and climate change, and social inclusion. They will set out concrete actions for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in their National Reform Programmes in April 2011. In addition, several of the flagship initiatives outlined in the communication including actions at both the EU and the Member State level have already found concrete follow up, including the Flagship Initiative ‘European Platform Against Poverty and Social Exclusion’. These measures underpin the stability, sustainability and inclusiveness of the EU's economy and provide confidence in the future for its consumers and producers.
