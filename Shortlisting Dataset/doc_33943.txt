9999/C Q999 E/004 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0350/04 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (02 February 2004) Subject: Travel agencies: repercussions of the Alitalia crisis on employment The crisis affecting Alitalia is likely to damage other sectors connected with air transport, in particular travel agencies. The industrial restructuring plan under discussion at present envisages drastic cuts in the commission paid to agencies - from 7% to 1% on the sale of international tickets and from 3% to 1% on the sale of domestic tickets. As reported by the national representatives of associations of travel agents, these decisions may lead to the closure of hundreds of agencies. This means that more than 10 000 jobs, about four times as many jobs as those threatened in Alitalia, are at risk. Furthermore the cuts, which would result in a rise in air fares, would have other repercussions on consumers. The end user would have the practical problem of obtaining tickets, because agencies are obliged to refuse to provide a service which has become too expensive. It should also be noted that operators in the sector were informed of these decisions, unprecedented in Europe, only 60 days in advance. In view of the serious consequences such a move would have on employment and bearing in mind that travel agencies are the main channel for air-ticket sales, since they manage 91% of ticket turnover, and hence a crisis in the sector would impact not only on Alitalia, worsening its already precarious position, but also on all other European airlines, can the Commission say: 1. whether the European Union has the power to intervene in the matter, in accordance with policies to safeguard employment or by virtue of any other relevant competence; 2. how it views the matter as a whole?
