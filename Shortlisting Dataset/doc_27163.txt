WRITTEN QUESTION E-2587/10 by Ole Christensen (S&D) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Uniform rules regardless of vehicle size The directive on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities applies only to workers driving vehicles of more than 3.5 tons. Can the Commission say why the directive and the provisions on driving times and rest periods do not cover all workers whose main occupation is to perform mobile road transport activities, regardless of the size of the vehicle? An example of this is craftsmen who are hired to perform a task which requires a certain amount of time for transport to and from the place of work. Can the Commission say why the rules on driving times and rest periods do not cover all occupations which involve driving?
