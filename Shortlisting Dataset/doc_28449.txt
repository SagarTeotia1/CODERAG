Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2011) After the outbreak of the Escherichia Coli crisis, the Commission promptly adopted Implementing Regulation (EU) No 585/2011 of 17 June 2011 laying down temporary support measures for the fruit and vegetable sector OJ L 160, 18.6.2011. for the period 26 May to 30 June 2011, with a budget of EUR 210 million. Since then, a positive trend of producer prices for cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuces, sweet peppers and courgettes has been registered and marketed volumes in the Union, that were significantly affected during June 2011, are recovering to normal levels. Consequently, the application period of the exceptional measures was considered long enough. As regards the range of products covered by the exceptional measures, the Commission decided to concentrate the efforts on the five most affected products, i.e. tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, sweet peppers and courgettes. The very nature of temporary exceptional support measures implies a focus on a limited number of the most affected products and to do so for a limited period of time. Finally, in order to adequately support vegetable producers and to cover all eligible requests, an additional budget of EUR 17 million has been mobilised, which brings the final budget to EUR 227 million.
