The hostages, including French-Colombian Ingrid Betancourt, have been held captive by the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas since February 2002. In his speech President Pöttering also welcomed the endeavours being made by the Columbian President Alvaro URIBE to seek dialogue to try to find an agreement to release the hostages. Marking the anniversary of the capture of the hostages, President Pöttering reiterated the European Parliament's solidarity with their families and highlighted that the eyes and thoughts of the international community and European Parliament are turned to the "human tragedy" of their situation.
