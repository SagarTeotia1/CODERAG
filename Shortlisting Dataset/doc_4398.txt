WRITTEN QUESTION E-3230/08 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (9 June 2008) Subject: Overtaking ban for HGVs on two-lane motorways Dangerous overtaking by HGVs on two-lane motorways regularly causes serious accidents. HGVs suddenly pull out into the overtaking lane, and cars behind which are adhering to the legal minimum distance from the vehicle in front are forced to make dangerous braking manoeuvres. All too often this leads to serious rear-end collisions resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Furthermore, overtaking HGVs obstruct the flow of traffic in the overtaking lane on motorways that are already overstretched by transit traffic. Overtaking is also dangerous for HGVs. One in four HGV accidents is down to overtaking. One third of accidents end in death or serious injury. For this reason some Member States have already imposed overtaking bans on sections of dangerous routes. If it is to overtake properly, an HGV must in principle be able to travel at least 20km/h faster than the HGV which is it overtaking. As a general rule, the overtaking HGV is not capable of doing so. However, this violation is not punished in the majority of cases. On the contrary, HGVs with a lower speed differential often overtake, resulting in negative effects. This prompts the following questions: 1. Do any studies exist in the EU on the effects of overtaking by HGVs? 2. What measures, pilot schemes etc. will the Commission introduce to bring the negative effects of overtaking by HGVs (accidents, traffic jams) on two-lane motorways under control? 3. Are there any plans at EU level for a general ban on HGVs overtaking on two-lane motorways or on certain stretches of roads (e.g. tunnels)?
