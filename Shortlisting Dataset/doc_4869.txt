withdrawal of licences of operators guilty of serious infringements. Transport providers must be of "good repute" to obtain an operating licence and MEPs adopted a list of infringements which may lead to the loss that status. Transport operators also need provide proof of their financial standing and short term solvency, and provisions are included to prevent operators working via "letterbox companies". Qualified managers must be a resident of a Member State. They must give evidence of their professional competence and if serious infringements are committed under their responsibility, they will be disqualified and will not be able to work as a transport manager within the EU. But MEPs said minor infringements should not disqualify managers and also simplified the financial requirements. Finally, a number of amendments tighten provisions on the storage and exchange of data in the national transport data registers in order to protect individuals. 20080520IPR29458 Establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator Common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services (recast) Common rules for access to the international road haulage market (recast) Texts, as adopted by the EP, will be available here (click on 21 May) EN 1 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5491012 EN 2 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5491062 EN 3 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5491022 EN 4 LINK /activities/plenary/ta/calendar.do?language=EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
