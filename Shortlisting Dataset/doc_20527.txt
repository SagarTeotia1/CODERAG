Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (11 January 2011) The Commission is well aware of the issues surrounding the request for preliminary ruling in Case C‑277/10. This case essentially evolves around the relationship between the producer and the principal director of a documentary. The preliminary reference focuses on the Austrian Copyright Code, notably Section 38(1) thereof, which contains a statutory transfer of all exploitation rights in a film to the film producer (cessio legis). The Commission has submitted observations on the interpretation of certain directives in the copyright and related rights acquis which were invoked before the national court. The Court, at this stage, has not yet convened a hearing and has not yet scheduled a date for rendering judgment In the interim, deontological rules and the interest of safeguarding due process in cases pending before the European Court of Justice prevent the Commission from publicly commenting on this case or discussing its observations outside the pending court proceedings.
