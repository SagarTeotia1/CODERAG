Question for written answer P-000546/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Laima Liucija Andrikienė (PPE) (27 January 2011) Subject: On the implications of ETS III on the fertiliser industry following the Commission decision of 15 December 2010 On 15 December 2010 the Commission agreed on the new edition of the Emission Trading Systems (ETS) III Directive 2003/87/EC (Section 10a on the setting of relative pollution benchmarks for various industries). It is clear that as a result of this decision the European fertiliser industry will suffer severe financial losses. What is more, this decision will put at an advantage fertiliser producers from countries that do not participate in the ETS, such as China, India, Russia, Belarus and others. As scientific data show, the European fertiliser industry is the most modern in the world with the lowest pollution levels. By imposing tougher requirements for the European fertiliser industry, we will be favouring foreign fertiliser producers, with the possibility that European producers will be completely pushed out of the global fertiliser market. As the production of fertilisers in Europe decreases, the EU will become more dependent on imports of fertilisers from third countries, such as China or Russia, which export fertilisers of much lower quality and higher polluting levels. Did the Commission carry out an adequate consultation of the European fertiliser industry before making the decision of 15 December 2010 and did it make a credible assessment of the impact this decision would have on the European fertiliser industry? Did the Commission carry out an assessment of how this situation would affect the competitiveness and sustainability of the European agricultural sector?
