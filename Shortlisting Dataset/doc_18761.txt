Endorses the Commission's analysis that it is important to maintain the contribution of nuclear energy in the energy mix, and to that end to promote without delay the establishment of a harmonised regulatory and economic framework facilitating the necessary investment decisions; calls on the Commission to draw up a specific road map for nuclear investments; considers it imperative to launch a debate within society, without prejudging the outcome, on the safe use of this source of energy; calls on the Commission to promote, as an integral part of European Neighbourhood Policy, the adoption by neighbouring countries of the acquis communautaire in nuclear safety every time a new nuclear plant is planned or an old plant is upgraded in these countries; 87. Recalls the significance of nuclear energy, which is produced in 15 out of 27 Member States and used by an even greater number, and which meets around one-third of electricity demand in the European Union; also recalls the six new reactors currently under construction in four Member States; 88. Stresses the competitiveness of nuclear energy, which is largely unaffected by fuel price fluctuations owing to the small proportion of generating costs that the fuel, uranium, represents; 89. Stresses that the European nuclear industry is the world leader in all nuclear cycle technologies, particularly enrichment, which contributes significantly to the Union's security of supply; 90. Welcomes the Commission's generally supportive stance regarding nuclear energy; points out, however, that it does not adequately address the issue of final disposal of radioactive waste, despite its immense importance for public perception; calls on the Member States concerned to step up their efforts with regard to resolving the problem of final disposal of all types of radioactive waste, but especially highly radioactive waste; 91. Considers it essential to reassure the Union's citizens that, in the Union, nuclear energy is used safely and transparently, and at the highest technologically possible level of safety particularly as regards the management of nuclear waste; welcomes the above-mentioned Commission proposal for a Council directive setting up a Community framework for nuclear safety; calls on the Council and Commission to develop models and procedures jointly with the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent the peaceful use of nuclear energy leading to the proliferation of nuclear weapons ; 92. Stresses that neither in its Revised Illustrative Programme nor in the strategic review has the Commission examined the likely development of nuclear technology by 2050, as suggested in the reference document of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform, or the position assigned to the ITER controlled fusion project; Towards 2050 93. Calls on the Commission and Member States to devise a European energy policy which will permit a massive conversion to energy efficient and low carbon emission energy technologies to meet the needs for energy consumption; stresses that, if energy efficiency and energy saving remain a priority, as does the continued development of renewable energies, it will be possible to meet energy needs from low-emission sources by 2050; 94. Reminds the Commission and Member States that steering the transition towards a highly-efficient energy system
