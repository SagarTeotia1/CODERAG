9999/C Q999 E/009 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0011/04 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (05 January 2004) Subject: Tunis summit and immigration policy The 5 + 5 Dialogue summit took place on 5 and 6 December 2003 in Tunis. According to the few reports that have appeared in the press, the main topic of discussion was strengthening cooperation in the Western Mediterranean, together, presumably, with the question of the migratory flows from North Africa to European countries, which are one of the most important factors in this cooperation. Since the 1999 Tampere summit, the European Union has been trying to devise a common migration policy. However, individual Member States are enacting legislation which differs substantially. Italy, for example, following an agreement with Tunisia, signed a bilateral agreement with Libya in July 2003 as many illegal boatloads of immigrants arrive from Libya. 1. What issues were on the agenda of the Tunis Summit? 2. Were any conclusions reached concerning the joint management of migratory flows to the Union in order to avoid a massive influx of illegal immigrants? 3. Did the summit consider proposals to step up security against terrorism for the Mediterranean countries and, at the same time, enhance economic development opportunities for the African countries bordering the Mediterranean?
