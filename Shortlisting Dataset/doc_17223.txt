Question for written answer E-000496/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Filip Kaczmarek (PPE) (24 January 2012) Subject: Increase in world population According to the latest UN figures the world's population will increase to 9.3 billion by 2050. Currently, the largest population growth is in Sub-Saharan Africa. This raises concerns about the ability to feed the population of Africa and of the entire world. The World Bank forecasts that between 2005 and 2055 agricultural production will have to increase by two-thirds in order to feed the growing population. We already know now that there is less and less new agricultural land available. The population increase is also associated with such problems as climate change and armed conflicts over access to food and water. In this connection: 1. Does the Commission have an action strategy regarding the growing world population? 2. Does the Commission intend to take steps to begin work immediately on a strategy for the growing population in Africa, so that we can prevent the spread of poverty when confronted by problems such as access to food and water?
