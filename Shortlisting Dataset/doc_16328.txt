ORAL QUESTION H-0224/02 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Neil MacCormick to the Council Subject: Postal services in rural areas Is the Council aware of the concern in rural communities over the need to maintain local offices for postal services, given that these often also function as local stores for general merchandise and thus form a focus for remote communities? In that light will the Council look favourably on the European Parliament's approach to liberalisation of postal services, maintaining the proposed 150g limit until such time as an in-depth review is undertaken on the feasibility for further liberalisation. Additionally, will the Council reject any moves towards a limit of 50g in 2006 as proposed by the Council in October 2001, without a proper understanding of the likely effect such a move would have on universal service and universal tariff provision?
