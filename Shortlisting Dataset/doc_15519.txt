financial environment (Item 02 02 03 02 ) 34. A call-for tender was to be launched by June 2006 with an expected decision and commitment of funds by the end of the year. The Commission is not proposing to enter any further appropriations in the 2007 budget, nor proposing to give a follow-up in terms of a new legal base. It states that the "efficiency and effectiveness of mentoring service needs to be demonstrated". The rapporteur underlines that this is exactly what the pilot project is intended to do and asks the Commission to keep the Parliament fully informed during the implementation phase in 2007. He also draws attention to the remark adopted by the EP in B2006 and asks the Commission to verify how this has been taken into account in the planned implementation: ...The pilot project will also seek to ensure that experience is pooled at European level among young entrepreneurs (owners or managers of SMEs, VSEs and craft undertakings) by means of traineeships and training courses within SMEs in key or complementary sectors. The relevant representative bodies (chambers of commerce and industry and craft associations) will be responsible for supporting and promoting this programme. The beneficiaries will be young entrepreneurs (owners or managers of SMEs, VSEs and craft undertakings) who are in the process of setting up in business or are planning to transfer their business in the short to medium term...
