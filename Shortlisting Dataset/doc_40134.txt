destined for free distribution through charitable organisations, schools, hospitals and similar institutions EU financial assistance in the case of free distribution is 100 % for quantities up to 5 % of the total volume of marketed production of the PO. This covers compensation for the withdrawn products in EUR/100 kg and flat-rate amounts for transport, sorting and packing costs. Food education must also be mentioned. The EU school fruit (adopted in 2009) and school milk (updated in 2008) schemes provide an essential contribution to the promotion of healthy food consumption patterns among children including information actions. On the other hand, the Commission is conscious that disposal of uneaten food generates impacts on the environment. Thus, a study about food waste is currently ongoing to evaluate the quantities of food wastages at every level (households, restaurants and catering, retail, wholesale and food industry) and their environmental impacts, identify their causes and make out possible initiatives to reduce them.
