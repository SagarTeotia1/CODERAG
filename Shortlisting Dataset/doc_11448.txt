Question for written answer E-000094/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sajjad Karim (ECR) (24 January 2011) Subject: Reforming the common agricultural policy In a major speech at the Oxford Farming Conference on 5 January, UK Secretary of State for the Environment Caroline Spelman called for a more ambitious approach to CAP reform and a fundamental change in the nature of the common agricultural policy. She has notably called for a change to the subsidy payments made to farmers, stating that the current policy distorts trade by keeping prices artificially high in the EU while imposing import tariffs on developing countries trying to sell to Europe. She has called for: — future subsidies to have less emphasis on food production, and reward farmers who take steps to protect the environment and deliver benefits such as improving wildlife habitats and biodiversity; — a reduction in the reliance on direct payments. Could the Commission give its views on these proposals?
