Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (23 July 2007) The Commission is aware of the report by the PlayFair 2008 campaign group. We have information that the Chinese Government is looking into the allegations. The Beijing Organising Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (BOCOG) is investigating at least four manufacturers for breaking labour laws in the manufacture of products for the Olympic Games. Apart from labour laws, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has stated that factories have agreed to abide by social responsibility requirements in the contracts for manufacture of Olympic merchandise. BOCOG is expected to inform of the results of the investigations in due course and has publicly announced that any violations of employment regulations will be dealt with seriously. The Commission will continue to monitor closely this serious matter.
