Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2011) The overall goal of the EU framework on salt reduction is to contribute towards reduced salt intake to achieve national or World Health Organisation recommendations. The framework was developed by Member States in 2008 as part of the Strategy on nutrition, overweight, and obesity-related health issues, which runs until 2013. In this context, it became clear that it would not be possible for all countries to reach their intake recommendations by 2013, and that work would have to continue beyond the end of the strategy. Based on the experience of salt reduction initiatives in some Member States, a benchmark for salt reduction of a minimum of 16 % in 4 years against the individual baseline levels of 2008 was established. Member States considered the target as realistic and achievable. Salt reformulation theory is based on the fact that taste can adapt to gradual reductions, if these are made across the board. The framework highlights that national benchmarks and plans could differ; and encourages food producers to reduce the salt levels beyond 16 % towards the lowest salt level achieved in the market for the specific product in question. Work on reformulation initiatives for nutrients other than salt is ongoing. Exchange of best practice and, as appropriate, agreement of suitable and realistic targets, will continue in 2011.
