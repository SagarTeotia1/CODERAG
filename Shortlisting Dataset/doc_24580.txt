Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) The Commission is not in a position to provide the information requested as the ratification processes in each individual Cariforum State are subject to domestic constitutional requirements, as well as to the workload of the respective Parliaments. In any event, it is the Commission's understanding that, judging from past experience, especially the ratification of the Cotonou Agreement, national ratifications are lengthy processes in the Caribbean countries, not dissimilar from those prevailing in the Member States of the European Union. This is why the EPA provides for provisional application (pending the completion of the national ratification processes and Parliament assent) of the Agreement so as to ensure early and speedy implementation of the commitments contained therein.
