Joint answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission Written questions : P-3354/04 , E-3362/04 (21 January 2005) Yes. The Commission has sought and obtained the agreement of Member States to a transitional regime for 2005 and 2006 that should allow all the problems raised by the Honourable Member to be resolved. In accordance with Article 2(h) of Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries OJ L 24, 30.1.1998. , ‘import’ means the free circulation of products and the intention to release products for free circulation within the meaning of Article 79 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code, OJ L 302, 19.10.1992. , i.e. after the customs status of Community goods has been conferred on the imported non-Community goods. Article 3(a) of Council Directive 89/556/EEC 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species OJ L 302, 19.10.1989. requires: ‘(a) [the embryos] must have been conceived as a result of artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation with semen from a donor sire standing at a semen collection centre approved by the competent authority for the collection, processing and storage of semen or by semen imported in accordance with Directive 88/407/EEC.’ Responding to trade problems in one Member State and following a favourable opinion by Member States at the meeting of 14 July 2004 of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, the Commission adopted Decision 786/2004/EC of 18 November 2004 OJ L 138, 30.4.2004. amending Commission Decision 92/471/EEC of 2 September 1992 OJ L 270, 15.7.1992. as regards model veterinary certificates for imports of bovine embryos. It later appeared that in order to adapt to the new rules, the sector needs a transitional period. To this end a Commission draft decision was approved by Member States at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health of 17 December 2004. This draft decision reinstalls for a certain period of time the previous import animal health requirements, provided that embryos not fully complying with the conditions laid down in Decision 786/2004/EC are not subject to intra-Community trade, but are implanted in the Member State of destination indicated in the certificate.
