excellent result ", underlining that the concluded agreement would involve less bureaucracy for SMEs. This view was in sharp opposition to that held by Holger KRAHMER (ALDE, DE), who considered the text to be a " bureaucratic monster ". While Claude TURMES (Greens/EFA, LU) deplored the Commission's allocation of just two administrators to tackle this vast programme, the Commissioner in charge of the dossier, Andris PIEBALGS , assured the Parliament that the Commission " will devote all resources needed to reach our objectives ".

Parliament today adopted the report by Satu HASSI (Greens/EFA, FI) on the sulphur content of marine fuels. This is the first time the Union has tried to tackle this problem, and it is timely: many ships use a fuel oil that is particularly heavy as motor fuels go, with a high concentration of sulphur (up to more than 300 times the motor fuel used in lorries). Moreover, while land emissions of sulphur dioxide have been in steady decline in the Union for years, there has been an increase in maritime transport emissions in common waters, with all of problems that this brings for the environment and human health: acidification, asthma, bronchitis, heart failure. If nothing is done, maritime sulphur emissions will account for 75% of all terrestrial emissions by 2010. Today's vote brings the second reading under co-decision to a close. The procedure formally ends here, informal negotiations with the Council - as happened with the framework directive on the eco-design of energy-using products - following the Environment Committee vote a month ago have brought a compromise. Eager to see the new Community legislation see the light of day, and without delay, MEPs were forced to give up certain demands in order to have the Member States on board. In the debate which preceded the vote, the rapporteur, Ms Hassi deplored that "negotiations with the Council indicate that many Member States wish to reject the entire proposal". Ms Asa WESTLUND (PSE, SE) added: "Parliament has not been able to go as far as it wanted, but it is out of our hands" if the final outcome is less ambitious than envisaged in the Environment Committee. The directive aims to reduce the sulphur content in marine fuels to 1.5% by 2007 (2 years after the entry into force of the directive). It will apply to all vessels in the Baltic, the North Sea, and the English Channel, and for passenger ships in
