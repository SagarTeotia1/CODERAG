Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (21 December 2011) The Commission's proposal aims to tackle the roaming problem in a durable way, by introducing structural measures that will create the conditions for a competitive roaming market. This will bring more choice and lower prices for the European consumers. In fact, it is expected that competitive pressure brought about by the structural measures will lead existing players to adjust their commercial practices and lower their prices already before 2014, when the decoupling measure will have to be fully in place. In order to safeguard consumer interests before the pro-competitive measures take full effect, it is proposed to extend the safeguard retail price cap mechanism for 4 years, as a safety-net for consumers. Cost estimates provided by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications were taken into account when setting the wholesale price caps. In proposing retail caps the Commission considers it important to set them at a level that would leave room for competition, which is expected to bring prices significantly below the level of the safeguard caps, and at the same time ensure a safety-net for consumers until the structural measures are fully operational and effective. The suggested spread between wholesale and retail caps takes into account that, at least in an initial phase when investments have to be made, new entrants need sufficient margins to make a case for entry.
