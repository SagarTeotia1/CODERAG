Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (5 June 2008) Decisions on the routes of particular road projects are a matter for national authorities. The possible role of the Commission is limited to ensuring that the procedural and substantive requirements of EC law are respected. There is an ongoing legal dispute between the Commission and Ireland in relation to the Irish legislation governing the removal of a national monument along the route of the M3 motorway and in relation to Ireland's interpretation of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 . . The Commission has decided to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice. The Commission does not consider that this dispute gives it a legal basis to propose to the Irish authorities alternatives to the present road project.
