Question for written answer E-001504/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Theodoros Skylakakis (PPE) (23 February 2011) Subject: Cost of agreement to activate direct aid to farmers for 2011 Ministerial Decision No 59216 was signed on 29 November 2010. It includes the ‘approval of an open call for international tenders to complete and collect the alphanumerical and geo-spatial data necessary for submitting a single payment application, and to record it in the OPEKEPE (Organisation for payment and control of Community aid from the EAGGF) database. This includes single payment applications made by farmers and the requisite information concerning rural development measures, quality retention, agricultural production insurance and the registration of all professional farmers and farm owners for the year 2011, with the right of option for 2012 and 2013.’ The cost of providing aid to 1 000 000 farmers in 2011 is EUR 35 000 000, including VAT. Given that 15 May 2011 is the deadline for submitting single payment applications, and considering the difficult economic situation in Greece and the large number of Greeks who receive single payments: Does the Commission have any information on the estimated budget for similar agreements in other Member States? If so, what was the estimated budget (cost per person receiving single payments) in these Members States? Is the deadline (15 May 2011) long enough to allow Greek farmers to submit their single payment applications in time?
