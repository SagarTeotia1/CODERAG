Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2010) 1. The Commission is aware of the situation as regards the current prevalence and increase in childhood obesity during the last decades. 2. Childhood obesity and its implications for children's health in terms of higher risk of chronic disease and a range of disorders, including social and psychological problems, is a cause of major concern. To contribute to reduce the risks associated with poor nutrition and limited physical activity, in 2007 the Commission put forward a comprehensive Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity-related health issues. The need to address childhood overweight and obesity is part of this strategy and children are identified as one of the priority groups for action http://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_determinants/life_style/nutrition/documents/nutrition_wp_en.pdf . The strategy underlines areas for action for both Member States and the EU to promote healthy diets, as well as to reverse the decline in physical activity levels in recent decades. To promote exchange of policy ideas and best practices between Member States and across government policies, the Commission has established a High Level Group for Nutrition and Physical Activity, composed of representatives of all Member States. To further strengthen cooperation with stakeholders, the Commission has created the Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. Its members have committed themselves to carrying out close to 300 actions in the areas of consumer information, education, promotion of physical activity and healthy lifestyles, marketing and advertising, and reformulation of foods http://ec.europa.eu/health/nutrition_physical_activity/platform/platform_db_en.htm . In addition, action has been taken in other areas such as within the common agricultural policy, the audiovisual media services, education and culture as well as research http://ec.europa.eu/health/nutrition_physical_activity/policy/strategy_en.htm . 3. The Commission is using the framework described above to promote and exchange best practices including community-based initiatives. 4. The Commission has just published a call for tender for an EU wide analysis of the different types of local community approaches to reduce childhood obesity, including school-based initiatives.
