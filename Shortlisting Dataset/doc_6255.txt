Reply (14 September 2009) The Council is deeply concerned about the situation in Honduras. The Presidency has issued a series of statements on behalf of the EU or in its own capacity, strongly condemning the military actions that violated the constitutional order of Honduras, calling for the restoration of constitutional order and democracy, urging all parties to refrain from violence and to strive to find a swift and peaceful solution, as well as supporting all mediation efforts by the President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias. Political contacts with representatives of the de facto Government have been restricted. The Council is also following closely the political situation in the whole region.
