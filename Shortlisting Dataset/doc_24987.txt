Question for written answer E-4464/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) (18 June 2010) Subject: Rights and obligations of airlines With a review of European policy on passenger air travel due in 2011, the recent volcanic eruption in Iceland raises a number of issues. 1. European air transport legislation is under attack from airline associations regarding the level of compensation to which passengers are entitled when flights are cancelled. What is the Commission's response to the following charges? (a) the level of compensation is disproportionate to the cost of the ticket! (b) in the US, compensation is half the European level, since in the EU the compensation payable is approximately four times the price of the ticket, compared to twice the price of the ticket in the US! (c) finally, the cost of compensation increases the ultimate price of the ticket, since airlines pass the cost on indirectly to passengers. 2. The decision to ban flights in virtually the entire EU airspace owing to the eruption of the Icelandic volcano has been judged unwarranted by many airlines. (a) Does it intend to adopt legislation specifying the terms and conditions for taking such decisions in future? (b) Does it believe that there is any merit in these arguments put forward by airlines which are claiming compensation, not asking for aid?
