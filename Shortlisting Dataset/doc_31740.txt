Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (18 September 2008) On 16 April 2007 and 10 August 2007 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) respectively published favourable opinions in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed OJ L 268, 18.10.2003. Regulation as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1981/2006 (OJ L 368, 23.12.2006). , on LLCotton25 http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/429.htm and A2704‑12 soybean http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/524.htm . The Authority concludes that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of or produced from LLCotton25 and A2704‑12 soybean as described in the applications will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of their intended uses. In its opinions, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States including France, Finland and Greece, in the context of the consultations of the national competent authorities, and provided them with a specific reply. The EFSA assessments on A2704‑12 soybean and LLCotton25, including the toxicological assessment, were performed according to the EFSA Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Panel guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified plants and derived food and feed. Concerning the application for the authorisation of A2704‑12 soybean, EFSA indicates in its opinion that this GM soybean is compositionally and agronomically equivalent to its non-GM comparator and that there is no indication for unintended effects of the genetic modification: as a consequence, the Authority concludes that no nutritional studies are needed. However, the applicant provided a 15‑day broiler feeding study which, notwithstanding the short duration of the study and the limited number of endpoints considered, was still analysed by the Panel. No indication of any unintended effect was shown. For the LLCotton25 application, EFSA concluded that the comparative compositional analysis and agronomic analyses show that this GM cotton is substantially equivalent to its non-GM counterpart and, as a consequence, that no additional safety studies with laboratory animals are needed. Since no new scientific elements questioning the favourable EFSA opinions on LLCotton25 and A2704‑12 soybean have been provided, the Commission has no intention of going back to EFSA to request additional guarantees on the safety of these two GMOs before adopting the two draft decisions. As the Honourable Member may know, the authorisation of genetically modified organisms is subject to the regulatory procedure set out in Council Decision 1999/468/EC 1999/468/EC: Council Decision of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, OJ L 184, 17.7.1999. . This decision and subsequent modifications are adopted by the Council, by unanimity and after consulting Parliament, in accordance with TEC Article 202. If the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, a new framework Regulation replacing this decision will have to be adopted jointly by Parliament and the Council on the basis of a proposal from the Commission (Article 291).
