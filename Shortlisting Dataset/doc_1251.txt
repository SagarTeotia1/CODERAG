1 b (new) A decision taken by the competent authorities not to renew a third-country national's residence permit or to withdraw it may be the subject of an appeal to a court. Justification Since both decisions usually have far-reaching consequences for the persons concerned and, more importantly, since it will strengthen the trust of the victim in the competent authorities in view of potential cooperation the possibility to appeal these decisions is very important. 19 February 2004 OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AFFAIRS AND THE INTERNAL MARKET for the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council directive on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals victims of trafficking in human beings or to third-country nationals who have been the subjects of an action to facilitate illegal immigration who cooperate with the competent authorities (14432/2003 – C5-0557/2003 – 2002/0043(CNS)) (Renewed consultation) Draftsman: Ioannis Koukiadis PROCEDURE The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market appointed Ioannis Koukiadis draftsman at its meeting of 1 December 2003.

SHORT JUSTIFICATION The case-law of the European Court of Justice Judgment of 16 July 1992 in Case C-65/90, Parliament v Council ; judgment of 10 June 1997 in Case C-392/95, Parliament v Council . requires the Council to reconsult Parliament further to any substantial changes it intends to make to the Commission’s original proposal, particularly to Article 3. The Council intends to amend the wording of the directive following some amendments by Parliament in its original resolution of 5 December 2002 A5-397/2002 . . For this reason the draftsman is now confining himself to proposing just two amendments. These are two amendments by Parliament which the Council has not incorporated in its recent text, 14432/03. One concerns the reinstatement of Article 4, the safeguard clause, which the Council has deleted. In its resolution of 5 December 2002 Parliament proposed making explicit reference to the Charter of fundamental rights of the EU of 7 December 2000 and to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950 giving additional protection at both international and constitutional level to the persons concerned. In view of the Council’s frequent practice of not including recitals in such texts it is impossible to tell at this stage of renewed consultation whether the intention to transfer the content of Article 4 to the recitals Council document 14432/03, footnote 1, p. 4. will be satisfactory. The other concerns the reintroduction of an amendment giving Member States the opportunity, if they so wish, to issue
