WRITTEN QUESTION E-6945/08 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (6 January 2009) Subject: Control of European agencies Besides the ordinary EU budget, an increasingly expensive extraordinary budget seems to be spreading in an increasingly dense web of diverse EU agencies — apparently, there are now 36 agencies with some 1 000 officials. In this structure, parliamentary control is bypassed, as is also the case with credit allocation from the European Investment Bank and the European Development Fund. The best example is the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), established in Vienna despite the prior existence of well-functioning human rights institutions (such as the Council of Europe and OSCE), which was always going to result in a conflict of competence. And even though the Court of Auditors came to the conclusion in 2001 that the FRA showed grave shortcomings in its financial conduct, EU funding for this agency, described by critics as superfluous, grew almost exponentially: from around EUR 4 million in 2002 to over EUR 15 million at present. Last year the FRA moved into an exclusive location with very high rent, as a result of which the annual rent tripled (!) to almost EUR 1.3 million. 1. Who makes sure that, with a growing number of EU agencies emerging and existing alongside established EU institutions, an overlap of competence does not arise? 2. How does the EU defend the extremely rapid increase in agency costs for duplicated work, especially in view of the belt-tightening prescribed for the public and the current global economic crisis? 3. Are there plans to set limits for the EU agencies’ financial conduct, which is getting out of hand? 4. Will the funding from the EU budget for the EU agencies be subject to direct parliamentary scrutiny in the future, or will oversight continue to be virtually non-existent?
