Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (24 June 2011) In the Commission's 2009 ‘Report on EU customs enforcement of intellectual property rights’ (Directorate-General Taxation and Customs Union) http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/counterfeit_piracy/statistics/index_en.htm , it is clear that the scale of the counterfeit and piracy challenge cannot be underestimated, and in this regard, the Commission report confirms that Italy is one of the most active and effective Member States in terms of total numbers of cases of articles detained by customs authorities. Italy alone represents over 10 % of the total number of 118 million articles detained by customs in 2009 in the EU. On 24 May the Commission proposed to entrust the tasks of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy — to the Office for Harmonisation in the internal market (OHIM) at Alicante. This will allow the Observatory to benefit from OHIM's IP expertise and designs. This will also allow the Observatory to look into innovative new anti-counterfeit technologies such as track and trace technologies to help in the investigation of Counterfeiting and piracy. An important legislative pillar in the fight against counterfeit goods is the 2004 directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (Directive 2004/48/EC) OJ L 195, 2.6.2004. . This directive provides for civil law measures allowing right holders to enforce their intellectual property rights but should be adapted, in particular to meet the specific challenges of the digital environment. Following the Commission report of December 2010 on the directive's application and a public consultation which ran until 31 March 2011 (culminating in a public hearing with stakeholders in Brussels on 7 June), the Commission will come forward in spring 2012 with proposals to strengthen the directive. The 2003 Customs Regulation (Regulation No 1383/2003) OJ L 196, 2.8.2003. is likewise a key legislative pillar to address counterfeit goods, and thus a very important weapon for customs authorities. The Commission believes however that this regulation should now be replaced by a new legal instrument. Building on the achievements of the current Regulation, this new instrument will allow customs to fight intellectual property infringements at the borders even more effectively in future. As regards legislation to fight money laundering and the financing of terrorism, there are at EU level several pieces of legislation in place which take into account the potential money laundering risks related to money transfers. This legislation encompasses inter alia Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing OJ L 309, 25.11.2005. , Commission Directive 2006/70/EC of 1 August 2006 laying down implementing measures for Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the definition of ‘politically exposed person’ and the technical criteria for simplified customer due diligence procedures and for exemption on grounds of a financial activity conducted on an occasional or very limited basis OJ L 214, 4.8.2006. , Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on
