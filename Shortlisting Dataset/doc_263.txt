Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (4 April 2007) The Community has a very comprehensive set of measures in place for the control of avian influenza, including Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EC OJ L 10, 14.1.2006. . The Commission has also adopted several additional legal acts to supplement the basic directive, in particular Commission Decision 2006/416/EC 2006/416/EC: Commission decision of 14 June 2006 concerning certain transitional measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry or other captive birds in the Community (notified under Document Number C(2006)2402) (text with EEA relevance), OJ L 164, 16.6.2006. on transitional measures for highly pathogenic avian influenza, Commission Decision 2005/731/EC 2005/731/EC: Commission decision of 17 October 2005 laying down additional requirements for the surveillance of avian influenza in wild birds (notified under document number C(2005)3877) (text with EEA relevance), OJ L 274, 20.10.2005. on notification of disease and mortality in wild birds, Commission Decision 2005/734/EC 2005/734/EC: Commission decision of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk (notified under document number C(2005)4163) (text with EEA relevance), OJ L 274, 20.10.2005. on biosecurity measures to prevent contact of wild birds to poultry, Commission Decision 2006/415/EC 2006/415/EC: Commission decision of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC (notified under document number C(2006)2400) (text with EEA relevance), OJ L 164, 16.6.2006. on regionalisation following an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by the Asian lineage (HPAI H5N1) and Commission Decision 2006/563/EC 2006/563/EC: Commission decision of 11 August 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/115/EC (notified under document number C(2006)3585) (text with EEA relevance), OJ L 222, 15.8.2006. on measures in case of a finding of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds. Current measures proved to be effective in 2006, when the HPAI H5N1 virus reached 14 Member States via wild birds. Furthermore, implementation of the Community rules on avian influenza has led to a very rapid and effective control of the disease following the recent outbreaks in Hungary and the United Kingdom (UK). The measures in place are under continuous review and are adapted regularly to take into account new scientific evidence and experience gained. The Commission would like to make the point that the European poultry industry is very much integrated, and the production cycle is particularly short compared with other livestock sectors. Consequently, the European poultry industry can quickly adapt supply to demand and thus avoid building up large stocks if consumption declines. In the event of serious market disturbances directly attributed to a loss in consumer confidence,
