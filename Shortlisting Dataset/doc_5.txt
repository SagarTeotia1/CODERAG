WRITTEN QUESTION E-4513/09 by Ingeborg Gräßle (PPE) to the Commission (25 September 2009) Subject: Conflicts of interest affecting independent certification bodies In the operation of the agricultural and structural funds the Member States enjoy a degree of administrative discretion in certain respects when it comes to setting up supervisory systems. 1. Is the Commission aware of cases where the structure of such systems may result in a conflict of interests for the bodies involved, for example: (a) where bodies that manage EU funding also extend credit, in the form of co-financing, to recipients of support; (b) where certification bodies monitor governments' compliance with the rules in their management of EU funding and, at the same time, audit the accounts of recipients of support; (c) other potentially conflictual arrangements? 2. In which Member States have such cases come to light? 3. Have monies been repaid as a result? 4. What is the Commission doing to prevent such situations arising?
