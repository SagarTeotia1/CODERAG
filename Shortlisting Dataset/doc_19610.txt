Answer given by Mr Kovacs on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2004) In the absence of unifying or harmonising measures in the EU, direct taxation falls essentially within Member States' competence. Nevertheless, when exercising their competence, Member States must respect the basic principles laid down in the EC Treaty. The different tax treatment of unmarried couples vis-à-vis married couples does not amount to discrimination on the basis of nationality or impose unjustified restrictions on cross-border activities. Therefore, there is no case for the Commission to intervene.
