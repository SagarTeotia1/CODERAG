Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (15 January 2008) The Commission agrees that it is essential to ensure assistance to European citizens in need in third countries. However, the Commission cannot intervene in the cases mentioned by the Honourable Member, which fall under the competence of the Member States. Article 20 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (‘Article 20 TEC’) provides that ‘every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic and consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that State’. This provision does not apply in cases where the Member State in question has a consulate or embassy in the third country, but fails to give the necessary assistance. The Commission Delegations shall cooperate with Member States for the purpose of assisting EU citizens. Article 20 of the Treaty on the European Union stipulates that the diplomatic and consular missions of the Member States shall cooperate with Commission Delegations by exchanging information, carrying out joint assessments and contributing to the implementation of Article 20 TEC. The role of Commission Delegations is also mentioned in the ‘Guidelines on consular protection of EU citizens in third countries’ Document of the Council of the European Union, 10109/06 of 2.6.2006. which are designed to provide a framework for consular cooperation, especially in situations in which the safety of EU citizens is endangered in third countries. According to these Guidelines, Commission Delegations can provide logistic support to Member States' missions, especially during crises.
