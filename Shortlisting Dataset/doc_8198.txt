Supplementary answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2010) Under the arrangements for shared management of the Structural Funds, management and implementation of the European Social Fund (ESF) is devolved to the Member State. In its capacity as managing authority, Agentschap SZW, the Dutch social affairs and employment agency, is accordingly directly responsible for managing and implementing the ESF operational programme (2007‑13), including the granting of ESF assistance at project and operation level. Calls for proposals are issued and projects are selected on the basis of the criteria set out in the national ESF rules (Subsidieregeling ESF 2007‑13). 1. The ESF contributions to the TNT training and development fund are published on the Agentschap SZW website www.AgentschapSZW.nl in accordance with Article 7(2)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006 of 8 December 2006 setting out rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund, OJ L 371, 27.12.2006, p. 1. . The managing authority can also provide the relevant information on the substance and objectives of decisions accompanying the grant of such assistance, as they are taken by the Agency on behalf of the Dutch Minister for Social Affairs and Employment. ESF assistance is designed to support actions covering a wide range of priorities in the Member States, including the types of training and retraining provision to which the Honourable Member refers. Such support is not, however, contingent on setting specific conditions in addition to the regulatory requirement on the managing authority to ensure that all ESF-co‑financed operations comply fully with the applicable EU and national rules. 2. Accordingly, displacement effects do not fall within the ESF’s regulatory remit, unless the conditions laid down in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 25. are fulfilled, i.e. if the assistance is subject to an obligation vis-à-vis the ESF to maintain an investment under the applicable rules on state aid and the action undergoes a substantial modification following a transfer of a productive activity within a Member State or to another Member State within five years from the completion of the operation. With a view to contributing to meeting the Treaty objective of strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion, the ESF’s primary tasks are to improve employment and job opportunities, promote quality and productivity at work and strengthen social inclusion through better access to employment for disadvantaged people. While the Commission fully recognises the potential impact of displacement on the TNT personnel concerned, it would again point to the ESF’s regulatory role, which is to support actions in the Member States, including those designed to assist persons threatened with
