WRITTEN QUESTION E-4248/09 by Charles Tannock (ECR) to the Council (7 September 2009) Subject: The fragility of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan In 2005 the Government of Sudan and the authorities in the south of Sudan signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, effectively ending the 22-year civil war, integrating the SPLM/A into the national government and creating a devolved government in the south. What concerns does the Council have that this agreement is in danger of irretrievably breaking down? What efforts is the Council making to try to ensure the viability of this agreement? What fears does the Council have about the likelihood of a referendum on independence for the south being conducted, as per the terms of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in 2011 as scheduled? What efforts is the Council making to work through the governments of other countries in the region to try to promote north-south stability in Sudan? What concerns does the Council have that a breakdown of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement would have negative knock-on effects across the region?
