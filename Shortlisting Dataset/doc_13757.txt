WRITTEN QUESTION P-6401/09 by Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) to the Commission (15 December 2009) Subject: Indication of country of origin of raw materials contained in milk and dairy products Following the recent rejection by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain of the Greek Government’s market regulation provision concerning the compulsory indication on milk and dairy product packaging of the country of origin of the raw materials contained therein; In view of the growing number of cases of consumers in Greece being misled by the inaccurate labelling of dairy products as ‘Greek’ or ‘local’; Given that dairy products are essential to ensuring a balanced and healthy diet for consumers, especially children, and that each country follows different quality control procedures at the raw material supply and processing stages; 1. If dairy product packaging provides no indication of the country of origin, which is likely to be a criterion for the selection, purchase and pricing of the product, how can compliance with the principle of accurate consumer information be guaranteed and how can the risk of fraud be avoided? 2. How can compliance with the principle of consumer health protection from unsuitable raw materials or inadequate inspection procedures in third countries be guaranteed? 3. How does the Commission verify whether the inspection procedures in each Member State are underpinned by the necessary infrastructures, resources and capacity to guarantee the quality of processed or unprocessed raw materials from third countries?
