Recalls its remit within the EU’s budgetary procedure, and emphasises the need for the EMPA to immediately take on more significant responsibilities by being involved in consultation and democratic supervision in respect of defining the areas of work, regularly monitoring the projects undertaken, and budget implementation; calls on the various relevant EMPA committees to carry out regular hearings of the Secretary General and the Deputy Secretaries General; takes the view, however, that this higher level of responsibility must go hand in hand with improvements in the operation and working methods of the EMPA, including granting the necessary human and financial resources and bringing the EMPA's work more into line with that of the other UfM institutions; welcomes the decisions taken to this end at the 6th plenary session of the EMPA held in Amman on 13 and 14 March 2010; 39. Welcomes the recent establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly (ARLEM) and calls for efforts to ensure proper coordination between the ARLEM’s activities and those of the EMPA, in particular through joint meetings or reciprocal invitations for members of their respective bureaux to attend working meetings; emphasises the need for these assemblies that bring together elected representatives from both sides of the Mediterranean and promote the exchange of best democratic practice; 40.
