Question for written answer E-004733/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Berlato (PPE) (16 May 2011) Subject: Huge quantity of Chinese cosmetics seized Last week, the Guardia di Finanza (financial police) in Legnano (province of Milan) seized a large quantity of cosmetics imported from China because, contrary to regulations, they did not bear labels or product information in Italian. The officials, who were checking the documents of a Chinese street vendor, traced him back to a warehouse used for delivery across the country. Some 1.2 million cosmetics items were seized, including nail varnish, eye liners, blusher, eye shadow, lip gloss and lipstick. 1. Is the Commission aware of similar cases in Europe? 2. Various dermatological studies have shown the serious damage which can be done to human skin by cosmetics which have been counterfeited, stored under bad conditions or used after their sell-by date. Does the Commission share the concerns about the potentially serious danger for the health of Europeans caused by Chinese cosmetics? 3. What measures does it intend to take to investigate how this kind of product enters Europe? 4. In view of the large quantity of goods seized, does it consider that the sale of this kind of product could damage SMEs in the cosmetics sector which comply with all the relevant EU regulations?
