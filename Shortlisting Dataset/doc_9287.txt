Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (13 March 2008) Directive 2006/48/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions OJ L 177, 30.6.2006. lays down minimum requirements for the granting of banking licences in the Member States. It follows from Article 11 of the directive that bank directors must be persons of sufficiently good repute and sufficient experience to perform their duties. These requirements must be complied with at the moment of authorisation as well as during the continued business activities of the bank. The directive, however, leaves to Member States the responsibility to define the detailed criteria of reputation and experience. Italy has implemented this provision and adopted requirements concerning the reputation of bank directors (Article 26 of the Banking Law ‘Testo Unico Bancario, Decreto Legislativo 1.9.1993, no 385’ implemented by a Ministerial Decree ‘Decreto Ministeriale’ of 1998). These requirements are in compliance with Article 11 of Directive 2006/48/EC. The definition of the detailed criteria, their application to single, specific cases and the enforcement of the national provisions are the responsibility of the Italian authorities.
