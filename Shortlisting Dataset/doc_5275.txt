the legal framework intended for SIS II applies, regardless of potential technical problems that will determine the choice of the final technical solution. The creation of the GPMB and its formal integration into the SIS II management structure, can be seem as a positive step in order to enhance the cooperation between the Members States and the Commission and, also, to provide direct Member States support to the central SIS II project. It is also important to limit the number of experts in order to ensure efficiency as well as cost effectiveness. In case the SIS II project fails Parliament reserves, itself, the right to invite the European Court of Auditors to carry out an in-depth audit on how the SIS II project was managed and on the financial implications for the Community budget. 17.3.2010 OPINION of the Committee on Budgets for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) N° 1104/2008 on migration from the Schengen Information System (SIS 1+) to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) ( COM(2009)0508 – C7‑0244/2009 – 2009/0136(NLE) ) Rapporteur: Alexander Alvaro SHORT JUSTIFICATION Parliament has repeatedly deplored the delays in the development of the SIS II project. It did so, for example, on 22 October 2009, when it adopted a resolution on the progress of the Schengen Information System II and the Visa Information System. The progress report on the development of SIS II, published by the Commission in October 2009, states that the two SIS II ‘milestone’ tests are to be carried out in the fourth quarter of 2009 and in summer 2010. As called for in the Council conclusions of 4/5 June 2009, the current SIS II project is being continued as a matter of priority, but a contingency plan (SIS 1+RE) is being held in reserve: If either of the milestone tests were to fail, the Council calls upon the COM to stop the project (guillotine-clause) and to switch to the technical alternative solution SIS 1+RE unless the Council decides with a qualified majority against this course of action. At this Council meeting, the technical feasibility of the alternative SIS 1+RE system is confirmed. That is why the Commission has submitted the new package of proposals ( COM(2009)0508 and COM(2010)15) amending the two legal instruments relating to the migration from SIS I + to the second-generation SIS. The preconditions for migration will not be met by 30 June 2010, nor will the migration be completed by the 4th quarter of 2011. In order for SIS II to become operational as required by Regulation (EC) 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA and in case of its failure after testing, an alternative scenario should be envisaged and full financial implications made available to all parties concerned as soon as possible. Costs for the development of the second generation Schengen Information System as well as costs of setting up, testing, migrating, operating and maintaining Central SIS II and the communication infrastructure are to be borne by the general budget of the European Union.
