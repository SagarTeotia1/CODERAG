Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (17 April 2008) The Commission has no knowledge of any irregularities at Terminal 4 of Madrid Barajas airport relating to border control or immigration issues. According to the Schengen evaluation plan this airport was evaluated in 2003. The competent Council working group (Schengen Evaluation) is currently discussing the new programme for the evaluation of the correct application of the Schengen acquis by the Member States, after the finalisation of the evaluations in 2006 and 2007, which were completely devoted to the Member States which joined the European Union in 2004 in order to asses their readiness for the lifting of internal border control at the end of 2007 for land and sea borders and in March 2008 for air borders. As regards air security, the Commission performed an inspection at Madrid Barajas airport in November 2007 based on the regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security, OJ L 355, 30.12.2002. and the Commission regulation laying down procedures for conducting Commission inspections in the field of civil aviation security Commission Regulation (EC) No 1486/2003 of 22 August 2003 laying down procedures for conducting Commission inspections in the field of civil aviation security, OJ L 213, 23.8.2003. . The latter regulation foresees that the national appropriate authority for aviation security in whose territory the inspection has been conducted is obliged to address the findings and recommendations of the Commission and to provide an action plan to remedy any identified deficiencies. Results of individual airport security inspections are confidential.
