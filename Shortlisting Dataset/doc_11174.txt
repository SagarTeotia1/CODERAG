Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (4 July 2011) The Commission calculates and publishes every year the administrative costs related to the execution of the ODA (Official Development Assistance) part of all of Heading 4 from the EU Budget and the European Development Fund (EDF). These figures are available (for year 2009) in the ‘Annual Report on the Union's development and external assistance policies and their implementation in 2009’. As indicated in this report, ODA spending managed by the Commission for 2009 is EUR 9.8 billion in payments effectively disbursed. The EUR 8.4 billion quoted by the Honourable Member from the European Court of Auditors Special Report (1/2011) does not cover the entire Heading 4 Budget funds. The administrative costs covering the execution of the EUR 9.8 billion of ODA disbursements amount to EUR 524 million. This works out at a cost of EUR 0.053 of each euro spent as EU development aid. The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the fact that this percentage may vary from one year to another due to the lesser elasticity of administrative costs compared to that of actual disbursements in a given year.
