of urgency, with the aim of establishing transparent and consistent criteria for determining the status of "workers" and "self-employed persons" in employment law; restates Parliaments position that any definition of a worker should be based on the de facto situation at the place and time of work; 36. Calls on Member States to promote the implementation without delay by the Member States of the 2006 ILO Recommendation on the scope of the employment relationship; 37. Appeals to the Member States to note the Recommendation of the International Labour Organisation that employment law should not interfere with genuine commercial relationships; 38. Urges that the open method of coordination be used in the sphere of employment policy and social policy as a useful instrument for exchanging best practice so as to respond to joint challenges in a flexible and transparent manner and taking into account the diverse conditions which are of crucial importance for labour markets in individual Member States; 39. Recommends to the Member States, the Council and the Commission that, within the framework of the Open Method of Coordination, they exchange best practices concerning the flexible organisation of working time and take account of innovative working time arrangements that strike a good balance between work and family life; 40. Calls on the Commission to continue collecting and analysing information on national labour markets so as to ensure that exchanges of good practice in connection with the employment policies pursued in individual Member States are based on reliable data , particularly homogeneous and comparable statistics; 41. Calls on the Member States to review and adapt social security systems and to complement active labour market policies, particularly training and life long learning with a view to new realities of work supporting professional transitions and (ex 386)re-entry into labour market to prevent any unnecessary dependence on benefits and work in the informal sector; 42. Strongly condemns the abusive replacement of regular employment with new forms of employment without any imperative economic necessity, which is commonly resorted to in European media undertakings in particular, with the aim of maximising short-term profits to a far greater than normal extent, at the expense of the general public, employees and competitors; stresses that such action violates the European social model, as it lastingly destroys the consensus, fairness and trust between employers and employees; urges Member States and the two sides of industry to take action in this regard in order to halt irresponsible abuses; 43. Reminds that flexicurity is defined as combining flexibility and security in the job market in a way that helps increase both productivity and the quality of jobs by guaranteeing security, while at the same time allowing firms the flexibility needed to create jobs in response to the changing needs of the market; is of the opinion that flexibility and security requirements are not contradictory and are mutually reinforcing; 44. Stresses that flexicurity can only be achieved by effective and modern labour law that reflects the changing realities of work; Notes that collective bargaining and strong social partners are an important part of the flexicurity
