WRITTEN QUESTION P-2684/05 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Council (14 July 2005) Subject: Use of EU territory and airspace for extraordinary renditions Member States have been accused by several human rights organisations of being complicit in the ‘extraordinary rendition’ of terrorist suspects to third countries, without due process, where they are at grave risk of torture and in flagrant breach of their right to a fair trial. There are also disturbing allegations that EU Member States have allowed their territory to be used as landing points for planes used in ‘extraordinary renditions’. Member States who allow their territory to be used in this way, and who allow flights to leave in such circumstances, are colluding in serious and persistent breaches of the human rights and fundamental freedoms principles of the EU, as outlined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. As the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice can not be a credible reality if EU territory and airspace may be used to perpetrate breaches of human rights, what action does the Council plan to take to investigate these allegations? If these Member States are found to be responsible for serious and persistent breaches of the human rights and fundamental freedoms principles of the EU as outlined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, is the Council prepared to take action under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, which would surely be justified in the circumstances, and suspend certain membership rights of those states?
