Question for written answer E-005233/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Simon Busuttil (PPE) (27 May 2011) Subject: 2009 air quality reporting for Malta According to Article 27 of the directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (Directive 2008/50/EC), the Maltese Government is supposed to provide the Commission with information on ambient air quality no later than nine months after the end of each year. In November 2010, during a meeting of the Petitions Committee at Parliament, the Commission confirmed that the Maltese Government had not yet provided this information for 2009. Can the Commission confirm whether it is now in possession of the information on ambient air quality in Malta for 2009? If so, is the information in full conformity with the directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air?
