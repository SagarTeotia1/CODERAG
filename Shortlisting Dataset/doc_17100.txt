therefore within the responsibility of each Member State to decide upon the introduction in its national plans of actions aimed at enhancing the management of solid waste. Hence the funds used for this purpose vary according to Member States' priorities. Likewise, the new Financial Instrument for the Environment, LIFE+ Regulation (EC) No 614/2007 of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+), OJ L 149, 9.6.2007. , allows participants to seek EU funding to cover actions in this field, including information and communication activities. The Commission is aware that the success of EU environmental policies in the Mediterranean Sea will, to a large extent, depend on the cooperation with non-EU countries. In this respect, the Commission underscores the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean initiative ‘Horizon 2020,’ adopted in the 2005 Barcelona Summit. The initiative will support through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the FEMIP (Euro-Mediterranean Facility for Investment and Partnership in the European Investment Bank) the identification and the preparation of pollution reduction projects relevant for urban waste management, as well as related capacity building activities, including development of legislation, institutions and support for local authorities and civil society. Likewise, under the European neighbourhood policy (ENP), a regular dialogue on environment and transport issues, including waste management, takes place with partner countries with the aim of sharing European advice and expertise. Exchange of best practices and experiences developed within the EU is an important means of supporting the enhancement of environmental protection in the Mediterranean partner countries.
