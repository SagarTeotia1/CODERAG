WRITTEN QUESTION E-6891/08 by Andreas Schwab (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (22 December 2008) Subject: EU role and measures in the Sri Lanka conflict It is well known that the armed conflict in Sri Lanka has long been characterised by frequently renewed outbreaks of the fighting between the parties to the conflict. This subject is hardly ever mentioned in the media, with the result that little attention is paid to the situation internationally. According to reports by the UN and NGOs, the current situation in certain regions of Sri Lanka is akin to war, and major human rights violations are taking place. Can the Commission state whether and, if the answer is in the affirmative, how the EU is involved in the peace efforts? What strategy is the EU adopting with a view to resolving the conflict? What immediate measures is the EU taking to relieve the humanitarian situation?
