WRITTEN QUESTION E-6337/07 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) to the Commission (17 December 2007) Subject: Fish oil: health risks and damaging effects on fish stocks Fish oil is promoted as being, among other things, good for the circulation. However, in recent years doubts have been expressed about the health benefits of fish oil. There are thousands of toxins in the sea, the most dangerous of them being dioxins and PCBs, as well as heavy metals such as mercury. Fish accumulate all such toxins in their livers and fatty tissues, and it is from these that fish oil is made. In order to eliminate the toxins, fish oil undergoes a form of refinement. All the toxic substances are removed, but at the same time the beneficial Omega-3 fatty acids are also eliminated. Subsequently these are partially restored (at least in some brands), but in a processed form which may cause them to lose their beneficial properties. Despite the doubts surrounding its health effects, production and consumption of fish oil is on the increase. It is, furthermore, no longer just a by-product, but increasingly fish are being caught for the sole purpose of fish oil production. This is causing fish stocks to become even more depleted. 1. Can the Commission confirm that consumption of fish oil supplements really does offer health benefits? 2. Can the Commission guarantee that harmful substances in fish oil capsules are present only in non-harmful quantities? 3. If not, is the Commission prepared to place a ban on claims for the health benefits of fish oil? 4. Is the Commission prepared to undertake more detailed studies of the environmental effects of fish oil production? 5. Is the Commission prepared to present a proposal whereby manufacturers would be required to include information on the environmental effects of fish oil on the label?
