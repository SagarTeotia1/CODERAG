Question for written answer E-6133/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) (29 July 2010) Subject: 120 million people living in poverty in the EU On 7 July 2010, meeting in Luxembourg, the EU's social affairs ministers admitted that the number of those living in circumstances of exclusion or poverty is likely to be in the region of 120 million. This estimate arises from the adoption, in addition to the traditional criterion which defines anyone earning less than 60 % of the average national income as ‘at risk of poverty’, of two other indicators which, added to the first, bring the numbers of the poor up to 120 million (by contrast with the previous estimate of 85 million). 1. Does the Commission not believe that the extent of poverty in the EU is such as to justify considering additional measures for fighting the problem? What measures have been or will be adopted by the Commission? 2. Does the Commission not consider it necessary to revise the objective of bringing 20 million out of poverty by 2020, since if the new estimate is correct this would in reality affect only one in six of those living in poverty? 3. Has the Commission undertaken a mid‑term assessment of the actions carried out in the framework of the European Year Against Poverty and Social Exclusion? If so, what are its conclusions as regards their practical results?
