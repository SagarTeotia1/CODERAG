WRITTEN QUESTION E-4997/07 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (11 October 2007) Subject: Further information on the case of the workers at the Rome central milk plant In its reply of 21 June 2007 to Question E‑2416/07 the Commission said it had received sufficient information from the Italian authorities and did not therefore consider it advisable to launch infringement proceedings, since the City of Rome had apparently reinstated the workers further to an option, chosen by the latter, provided for in the trade union agreements. Therefore, the redeployment of the workers does not appear to have been carried out as part of a transfer of undertakings within the meaning of Directive 2001/23/EC OJ L 82, 22.3.2001, p. 16. . However, further information which emerged this summer points to the direct responsibility of the City of Rome. Indeed, on 31 July 2007 the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio for the second time ruled that the contract of sale with which the City of Rome had, in 1997, sold 75 % of the central milk plant to Cirio, and subsequently to Parmalat, was null and void. Accordingly, all subsequent acts, including those concerning the workers, are also null and void. Can the Commission therefore say: 1. whether it is aware of this latest ruling by the Regional Administrative Court and how it intends to defend the rights of the workers, and 2. whether it intends to ask for further information from the Italian Government?
