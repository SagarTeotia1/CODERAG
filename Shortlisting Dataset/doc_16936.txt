on the directive by 12 December 2007. . In accordance with better regulation principles, the Commission is working closely with Member States and other stakeholders during the transposition period, in order to facilitate timely and correct transposition and uniform application of UCP. For these purposes, the Commission has established a working group of Member States experts. Four meetings of the UCP Transposition Working Group have taken place (October 2005, January 2006, June 2006 and November 2006). The Commission has also facilitated informal UCP discussion days in small groups and held bilateral meetings with Member States, which requested guidance from the Commission. On these and other occasions, the Commission takes the opportunity to provide the Member States with further clarification on several aspects of the unfair practices covered by UCP, including misleading advertising. Finally, UCP cooperation will extend beyond the transposition period, in order to examine how the directive is applied in practice. A comprehensive report on the application of UCP is due in 2011.
