the establishment of the European single market and the liberalisation of the road traffic sector has led to a substantial increase in competition. Transport enterprises have failed to comply with Community rules on driving and rest periods. Since rules on working conditions in the industry are still poorly implemented, Parliament's amendments aim at ensuring the proper implementation of these rules, in particular regarding roadside checks. These checks will be carried out following a random rotation system, so that drivers will have to reckon with checks throughout the road network. The Commission proposed that each Member State should organise checks in such a way that they cover at least 3% of days worked by drivers of vehicles but MEPs in the committee felt that a figure of 2% was enough. Where the Commission had proposed that not less than 30% of the working days checked should be checked at the roadside checks, Parliament is proposing to change this figure to 15%. The Commission was called on to submit to the EP, within three years of the entry into force of this directive, a report analysing the penalties set out in the legislation of the member states for defined offences. At present, the fines imposed differ quite significantly and harmonisation was therefore necessary.

Of particular significance to MEPs was the de facto extension of the co-decision procedure to include changes to the list of TEN projects. Council had also taken into account Parliament's amendments regarding the environment and the measures proposed by Parliament, to ensure that it will be properly consulted, under co-decision, when measures are taken that may alter established priorities in any way. The Transport Committee had underlined the fact that the text under consideration was a compromise. The Green/ALE and GUE/NGL groups had tabled amendments to the common position, in particular with regard to the Annex III,
