on the Member States to strengthen their incentive policies for the construction sector, to facilitate a reduction in energy demand and CO2 emissions. Members in the committee also call on the Commission to rapidly propose a roadmap for the gradual, but rapid, abolition of EHS in accordance with the European Council’s decision on the review of the sustainable development strategy. On this matter, they expect the Commission, when it revises the Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, to take proper account of the need to influence production, traffic, transport and consumption patterns, and to reduce waste. Lastly, the report calls on the European Union to distinguish gross economic wealth per inhabitant from net economic, social and environmental wealth as the true progress indicator (TPI). The European Commission and the Member States are called upon to study in more depth the possibility of measuring European growth using ‘green’ indicators, which factor in the wealth lost as a result of environmental damage.
