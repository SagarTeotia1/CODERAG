WRITTEN QUESTION E-5092/07 by Mario Borghezio (UEN) to the Council (16 October 2007) Subject: Authorisation to cultivate GM potatoes — health risks of GMO products According to press reports, the European institutions are on the point of authorising production on EU soil of the Amflora ‘GM super-potato’ produced by the German chemicals multinational BASF. In the view of some scientists, this potato could seriously pollute other crops and make the human organism resistant to certain antibiotics. This would mean, furthermore, that the European Union was for the first time authorising GMO production on its own territory, against the wishes of millions of consumers and citizens who do not want GMO agriculture or food. Does the Council not think that this authorisation should be refused?
