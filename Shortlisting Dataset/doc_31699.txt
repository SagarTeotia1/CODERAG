be proposed in the ‘environmental statement’. There is no specific legislation in the acquis concerning odours originating from sewage sludge treatment. However, according to Article 4 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC OJ L 194, 25.7.1975 , as amended by Council Directive 91/156/EEC of 18 March 1991 ( OJ L 78, 26.3.1991 ). on waste, as amended, Member States have to take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment, and in particular without causing a nuisance through noise or odours. To the extent that the sewage sludge produced by urban waste-water treatment plants and subject to de-watering can be classified as a waste in accordance with Article 1(a) of Directive 75/442/EEC, Member States have a specific duty in minimising and eliminating any odour nuisance. Depending on local conditions, this can imply that a sewage dewatering unit is located in a closed building and the air and odour emissions stemming from it are properly treated before release into the outside atmosphere.
