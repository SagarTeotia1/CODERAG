9999/C Q999 E/041 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0693/04 by Johanna Boogerd-Quaak (ELDR) , Ieke van den Burg (PSE) and Joke Swiebel (PSE) to the Commission (25 February 2004) Subject: Proposal COM(2003) 657 and Directive 86/378/EEC Commission proposal COM(2003) 657 for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services refers to the use of sex-based actuarial factors. As the Commission rightly points out in the explanatory memorandum and in recital 13 of the proposal, the use of sex-based actuarial factors is widespread in the provision of insurance services, even when such differences do not necessarily reflect objective differences. It is, therefore, appropriate to prohibit the use of these factors (see Article 4 of the proposal). We wholeheartedly applaud this and will support the Commission on this proposal. At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that, in the fourth Equal Treatment Directive (Council Directive 86/378/EEC OJ L 225, 12.8.1986, p. 40 . of 24 July 1986 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes), the use of actuarial calculation factors which differ according to sex may be maintained, pursuant to Article 6(1)(h). This situation can cause confusion when it comes to deciding whether supplementary pension rules come under the second or third pillar, and thus whether they must be treated under Directive 86/378/EEC or under the new directive. On the assumption that the above-mentioned Commission proposal will soon be approved by Parliament and the Council, we ask the Commission the following question: Is the Commission prepared to propose to Parliament and the Council a revised version of Directive 86/378/EEC, so that the use of sex-based actuarial factors may be forbidden also in the business and sectoral rules on social security?
