Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (28 October 2005) The Commission is following with keen interest the recent political developments in the Maldives. After the events the Honourable Member mentions, the Commission took part in an EU-Canadian fact-finding mission between 24 and 26 August 2005 and gave its full support to the subsequent EU declaration of 2 September 2005 C/05/219, http://europa.eu.int/comm/external_relations/maldives/intro/press05_219.htm . The trials of those arrested are being closely monitored by representatives of the International Commission of Jurists and the EU is paying close attention to the conduct and progress of the court cases. The EU is in constant dialogue with the government on human rights issues. In particular, it is encouraging the government to ensure that the Human Rights Commission (HRC) Bill under discussion is fully aligned with international standards, guarantees autonomy for the HRC and provides sufficient resources and investigative powers. After encouragement by the EU and other donors, the Government of the Maldives has now begun work on a draft paper to identify reform process milestones to be achieved within two years. We are urging the government to undertake this process in a genuinely consultative manner to involve all stakeholders and the wider public of the Maldives, to raise awareness of and confidence in the reform process. In addition, the EU has proposed measures to upgrade political dialogue with the government and civil society of the Maldives. In this way, the EU will continue to pass its message of support for constitutional and other reforms to enhance democracy. As part of this process, an EU Heads of Mission Troika is expected to visit Male’ before the end of 2005 to follow up on the fact-finding mission and EU declaration. In addition, the EU will investigate the possibilities of supplying capacity-building and technical assistance in areas key to reform.
