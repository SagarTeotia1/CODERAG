Question for written answer P-011302/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Søren Bo Søndergaard (GUE/NGL) (13 January 2011) Subject: Pollution from combustion of aviation fuel at European airports An interim report recently published by Denmark's Environmental Investigations, University of Århus, shows an alarmingly high concentration of ultrafine particles at Copenhagen Airport produced by the combustion of aviation fuel (http://projektcleanair.dk/Målinger-CPH/121110-rapport.asp). If these results are confirmed by further studies, they uncover a major pollution and working environment problem with serious implications for the health of airport staff who spend their working time in these heavily polluted areas. In the light of this report and the Commission's answer to our question of 8 March 2010 (E‑1326/2010) on work-related cancer, will the Commission say what practical initiatives it will take to expose the health problems caused by pollution from the combustion of aviation fuel at European airports?
