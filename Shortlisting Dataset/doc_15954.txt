Question for written answer E-002235/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (28 February 2012) Subject: Land speculation In our view, the Commission’s proposal for the common agricultural policy (CAP) ignores a situation that arises fairly often in Spain. It is very common for farmers or stock-breeders working on a given piece of land not to be the owner of it, which often leads to land speculation. Crop or livestock farms comprising owned and rented land may not have sufficient land area to be eligible for CAP support. Moreover, the announcement that the valid land area will be the area that is declared within three years will further exacerbate the situation. In view of the above: Does the Commission consider this situation to be fair to crop and livestock producers who do not own part or all of the land that they farm? Does the Commission not believe that it would be more logical to attempt to prevent speculation by, for example, combining the reference year with 2011?
