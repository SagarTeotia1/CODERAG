Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (5 August 2011) The Commission refers the Honourable Member to the answer already given to his Written Question No E‑2979/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . Following the introduction by Norway on 11 May 2011 of new regulations relating to fishing for haddock in the Svalbard FPZ, whereby fisheries of haddock in the area by EU vessels are limited only to by-catches, in response to the introduction of these measures, the EU Delegation in Oslo delivered a Note Verbale on 8 July to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was made clear that the EU maintains its consistent position as regards the rights of Member States in the Svalbard FPZ and that acceptance by the EU of fishery regulations for this area has consistently been conditional on them being: — Applied in a non-discriminatory manner; — Based on scientific advice; and — Respected by all interested Parties. The Commission has indicated to Norway in this Note Verbale that these new regulations have been applied in a discriminatory manner and that they disregard the specific provisions of the Treaty of Paris of 1920. To ensure sustainable fisheries and to maintain the rights of EU Member States, the Commission considers that it is necessary to establish autonomous EU measures for the haddock fisheries in ICES Areas I and II, which will include fisheries in the Svalbard FPZ. The establishment of these autonomous measures will respect the EU's consistent approach to its conservation and cooperation obligations under the International Law of the Sea. There is no compensatory mechanism in place for potential losses incurred by the vessels in question. However, the Commission would welcome informal discussions with Norway in order to ensure that the rights of Member States in the area are maintained and that a fair division of any possible quotas is ensured, including any quotas allocated to the EU.
