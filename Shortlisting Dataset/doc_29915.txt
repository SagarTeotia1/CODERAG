Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (19 October 2007) The Commission is aware of the new development on the market. From a market point of view, the 2003 dairy reform may be considered a success as the objectives set out have to a large extent been met. With a better balance of the markets, dairy prices have settled at higher levels with only limited support of the internal market. Also due to exceptional demand on the world market, the current wholesale and retail price have suddenly increased in a short period. Moreover, a shortage of milk deliveries is observed. So for the last quota year 2006/2007, the total quota is not fulfilled at European Union level. Some Member States have significantly under-used their quota including Poland. Faced with an increase in the raw milk prices, producers should be encouraged and in some areas they will produce more. Against this market situation the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development has already signalled that the expiry of the milk quota system by 31 March 2015 should be accompanied by measures leading to a ‘soft landing’ and allowing farmers to prepare themselves for the ending of the milk quota system. Among these measures, a possible increase of the current milk quotas over time is subject to further examination. The Market Outlook Report for the dairy sector and forthcoming Communication on the so-called ‘Health Check’ of the common agricultural policy (CAP) that will be adopted by the Commission later in 2007 will provide the basis for a thorough discussion on the future of the milk sector.
