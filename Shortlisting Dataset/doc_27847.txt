Question for written answer E-9621/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Lorenzo Fontana (EFD) (23 November 2010) Subject: Funding research into biological control of the chestnut gall wasp The area around Monfenera, in Italy’s Veneto region, is famous for is chestnut orchards. The sweet chestnut ( Castanea sativa ) trees grown there produce high-quality chestnuts for which there is a high level of market demand, and which have recently been classified as a PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) product. Last year chestnut production declined drastically from 1000 q to 300 q, a 60% reduction. The main cause of these huge losses is the chestnut gall wasp ( Dryocosmus kuriphilus ), a pest of Asian origin which slows the tree's rate of growth and significantly reduces the amount of fruit produced. The Oriental chestnut gall wasp is currently found not only in most Italian regions, but also in France, Slovenia, Switzerland, Hungary and the United States. In many thickly wooded areas affected, including Monfenera, the use of pesticides is counterproductive. Action to promote the study of, and research into, natural predators is therefore required. Bearing in mind Council Directive 2009/29/EC and subsequent amendments thereto, the opinion issued in June 2010 by the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) on the risk to plant health posed by the Oriental chestnut gall wasp, and the results of the conference held by the EPPO (European and Mediterranean Plan Protection Organisation) in Treviso from 22 to 28 October 2010, does the Commission intend to support the States and Regions concerned by helping to fund research projects focusing on the Oriental chestnut gall wasp and by taking the necessary measures to tackle this threat to plant health?
