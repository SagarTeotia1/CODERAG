ORAL QUESTION H-0167/03 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Liam Hyland to the Council Subject: Older farmers and the demographic debate The Commission has indicated its concerns about the impact of ageing populations on labour markets and potential growth issues and says there must be a clear economic incentive for people to stay in the labour market. The Heads of State or Government have set Europe the goal of becoming a dynamic area by raising potential growth rates to 3% by 2010. Will the Council state where it believes the farming sector and older farmers fit into this demographic debate?
