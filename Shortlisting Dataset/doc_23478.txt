EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission OJ C 203, 17.7.1999, p. 1. was amended by Council Decision 2006/512/EC of 17 July 2006 OJ L 200, 22.7.2006, p. 11. . Article 5a of amended Decision 1999/468/EC introduced the new 'regulatory procedure with scrutiny' (RPS) for 'measures of a general scope which seek to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with codecision, inter alia by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements' . Following the screening of the existing legislation and on-going procedures COM(2007)0740 . , the European Commission presented inter alia this recast proposal, transformed from a codification in order to incorporate the amendments necessary for the alignment to RPS. In its decision of 12 December 2007 the Conference of Presidents designated the Committee on Legal Affaires as the lead Committee to deal with this 'comitology alignment' and the specialised committees as opinion-giving committees. The Conference of Committee Chairs agreed on 15 January 2008 on the modalities of cooperation between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the other committees involved. In view of the fact that the proposed alignment to RPS is complete, the Committee on Legal Affairs does not propose any amendments, apart from the technical adaptations suggested by the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services. 5.6.2008 OPINION of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the Committee on Legal Affairs on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the colouring matters which may be added to medicinal products (Recast) ( COM(2008)0001 – C6‑0026/2008 – 2008/0001(COD) ) Draftsman: Thomas Ulmer ****** The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calls on the Committee on Legal Affairs, as the committee responsible, to propose approval of the Commission proposal.
