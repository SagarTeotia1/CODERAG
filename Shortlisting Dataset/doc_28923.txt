WRITTEN QUESTION P-4294/05 by Hélène Goudin (IND/DEM) to the Commission (16 November 2005) Subject: Freedom of movement within the EU The Finnish seamen's union attempted to prevent the reflagging of the Viking Line ferry ‘Rosella’ by means of industrial action. Viking Line claimed that such action was unlawful and an obstacle to freedom of movement within the EU. The Court of Justice is now to decide whether the union had the right to take industrial action in this case. Does the Commission intend to submit a written statement to the Court of Justice or to involve itself in any other way in this case? What is the Commission's opinion in this specific case?
