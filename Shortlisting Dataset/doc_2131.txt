Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2010) The possibility of performing searches in case-law using the codes of the Digest of case-law has been fully re-established since 11 February 2010. To solve the problem, a full re-indexation of the documents in the database had to be performed. Given the number of documents involved, this was a process which could not be performed before a number of important operations needed to make the site stable were carried out. The exercise could, therefore, not be planned at an earlier date. The Publications Office regrets the inconvenience caused to the users of the EUR-Lex system.
