Answer given by Ms Wallström on behalf of the Commission (14 December 2006) The final wording of the paragraph of the June 2006 European Council conclusions devoted to Commission's relations with the national parliaments (NP) reads as follows: ‘The European Council notes the interdependence of the European and national legislative processes. It therefore welcomes the Commission's commitment to make all new proposals and consultation papers directly available to national parliaments, inviting them to react so as to improve the process of policy formulation. The Commission is asked to duly consider comments by national parliaments — in particular with regard to the subsidiarity and proportionality principles. National parliaments are encouraged to strengthen cooperation within the framework of the Conference of European Affairs Committees (COSAC) when monitoring subsidiarity.’ During the two first months of documents transmission, in September 2006 and October 2006, the Commission sent around 120 documents to the NP. These are the same documents as those sent to Parliament. The Honourable Member can find these documents on Parliament's Greffe system. They are transmitted in the official EU language(s) requested by the NP depending on availability of translations, with English and French versions always being on hand. Until 10 November 2006 the Commission received 22 opinions from the NP. Twelve of them concerned the proposal COM(2006)399 final. for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000, OJ L 338, 23.12.2003. , which was the subject of a subsidiarity and proportionality test carried out in the framework of COSAC.
