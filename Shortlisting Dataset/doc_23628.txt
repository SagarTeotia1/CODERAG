Answer given by Mrs. Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (12 January 2012) The EU's climate and energy targets to be met by 2020 include: a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20 % below 1990 levels, 20 % of energy consumption to come from renewable resources and 20 % reduction in primary energy use compared with projected levels, to be achieved by improving energy efficiency. The EU is committed to go to a 30 % reduction of greenhouse gases emissions if other major economies commit to take on their fair share of global action. With regards to conflicts caused by climate change, the Council conclusions on EU climate diplomacy from the 18th of July 2011 stated that climate change ‘acts as a “threat multiplier”, exacerbating tensions over land, water, food and energy prices, and creating migratory pressures and desertification.’ Consequently, the Joint Reflection Paper from the High Representative and the Commission, ‘Towards a renewed and strengthened European Union Climate Diplomacy’ set out three strands for action on EU climate diplomacy: promotion of climate action, supporting implementation of climate action and climate change and international security.
