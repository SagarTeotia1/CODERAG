Question for written answer P-7036/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (7 September 2010) Subject: National asset management agency in Ireland? Is the Commission concerned that the continued intervention by the Irish government in supporting Anglo Irish Bank, which could eventually be worth up to EUR 35 billion, has the potential to distort the Irish banking market? Is the Commission of the view that such an intervention goes against the competition rules of the EU, which it has the responsibility to implement?
