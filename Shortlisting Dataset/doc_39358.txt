Reply (20 June 2011) In its conclusions of February 2011, the European Council underlined Europe’s needs to diversify its routes and sources of supply and invited the Commission to continue its efforts to facilitate the development of strategic corridors for the transport of large volumes of gas such as the Southern Corridor. In conclusions of February 2011, the European Council stated that work should be taken forward as early as possible to develop a reliable, transparent and rules-based partnership with Russia in areas of common interest in the field of energy and as part of the negotiations on the post-Partnership and Cooperation Agreement process and in the light of ongoing work on the Partnership for Modernisation and the Energy Dialogue. It should be recalled that the Nabucco and ITGI projects received support within Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy OJ L 200, 31.7.2009, p. 31. . However, the EU as such is not a party to any pipeline projects; these are implemented by private companies. The possible merging of projects hitherto considered as separate is therefore a decision which ultimately rests with private companies.
