WRITTEN QUESTION E-1630/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (19 March 2008) Subject: The monitoring and licensing of nurseries and nursery workers in the UK A recent BBC report exposed serious inadequacies in the monitoring and licensing of nurseries and nursery workers in the UK. In particular, it criticised the nursing inspectorate watchdog ‘Ofsted’ for gross failures in carrying out its duties. In addition, reference was made to a possible cover-up, through the actions of a certain British MP, of the inadequacies in a certain nursery that, it was claimed, led to the death of a young child. The said MP was at the time Managing Director of the chain of nurseries involved in the incident. Considering the seriousness of this subject, will the Commission enquire with the UK authorities to make sure that all possible corrective measures have been taken to remedy the situation and safeguard the health and wellbeing of children attending nurseries in the UK? Will the Commission extend its enquiries in this important subject, to cover all Member States?
