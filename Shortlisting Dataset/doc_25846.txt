– having regard to the report of the Committee on Regional Development and the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy ( A7‑0138/2010 ), A. whereas the renewed Lisbon strategy gives high priority to research and innovation so as to respond to challenges such as climate change and increasing global competition; whereas in the post-crisis era stimulating growth and jobs through research and innovation has become ever more important, constituting a core target of the proposed EU 2020 Strategy, B. whereas the implementation of research and innovation is a need shared by all strata of society and its purpose must be to improve people’s social and economic conditions; C. whereas European support for research and innovation is primarily provided through research, innovation and cohesion policy, the main instruments of these being the Structural Funds, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research (FP7) and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), D. whereas cohesion policy is an essential pillar in the process of European integration and one of the most successful EU policies, facilitating convergence between increasingly diverse regions and stimulating growth and employment, E. whereas innovation is most effectively addressed at regional level with the proximity of actors, such as universities, public research organisations or industry, promoting partnerships in knowledge transfer, and the exchange of good practices between regions; F. whereas the second Community Strategic Guideline on cohesion for the period 2007-2013 refers to improving knowledge and innovation for growth, and consequently 25% of the total allocation has been budgeted, G. whereas the complexity of today’s challenges calls for an integrated mix of these policies; whereas the knowledge society requires, more than just an aggregation of the activities of the different sectors, a synergy between agents and instruments, which is vital so that they reinforce each other and support the sustainable implementation of research and innovation projects, delivering a better valorisation of research outcomes in the form of concrete product ideas in the regions; H. whereas, while some elements of the architecture of these instruments, such as the same time frame and alignment with the Lisbon agenda, allow for synergies, there are still differences, such as different legal bases, thematic versus territorial focus, and shared versus centralised management, Cohesion Policy delivering research and innovation objectives 1. Appreciates that, in 2007-2013, in conformity with the second Community Strategic Guideline on cohesion, all Member States have devoted a significant amount of their total financial allocations to R&D, innovation and development of a knowledge-based economy, resulting in 246 National or Regional Operational Programmes with around EUR 86 billion allocated to research and innovation, of which EUR 50 billion have already been allocated for core R&D and innovation; notes that cohesion policy has become a major source of European support for this field, rivalling the budget of both FP7 (EUR 50.5 billion) and CIP (EUR 3.6 billion); points to the effectiveness and the possibility of determining quantified targets in terms of the amounts allocated to research and development spending; 2. Welcomes the fact that new financing methods exist and underlines the potential of the JEREMIE
