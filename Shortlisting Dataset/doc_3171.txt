The European Parliament recommends broad approval of the proposals, although it has reservations about certain points, including the amount of funds to be switched from the "first pillar" of the CAP (market support) to the "second pillar" (rural development) as well as the capping of direct aid. At this stage, the own-initiative report t constitutes Parliament's initial response to the Commission's general ideas on further CAP reform. At the next stage, the Commission will submit draft legislation, on which Parliament will have to be consulted. Major shift in European agricultural policy in recent decades Since 1992 the CAP has undergone three major overhauls, all designed to: improve the efficiency and transparency of the CAP; make farming more market-oriented; better integrate new features – especially environmental and animal protection – into agriculture policy; boost rural areas. The earlier system of price support, which proved unable to solve the problem of farmers’ low incomes and also led to large surpluses that could only be disposed of on world markets with the aid of further subsidies, has been gradually replaced by a system of direct payments. The new reform plans (or "health check") must be seen against this background. The main Commission proposals in the "health check" are: further decoupling of aid from production, a faster move to an area-based flat rate for direct payments, the abolition of smaller, production-based measures or their integration into the system of decoupled direct payments, further modulation (the shifting of funds from the first to the second pillars), the capping of direct aid and an increase in minimum thresholds for payments, and a commitment to end the milk quota and pave the way for a "soft landing". Parliament's main demands In the own-initiative report drafted by Lutz Goepel (EPP-ED, DE) and approved, as amended, by 510 votes to 88 with 80 abstentions, the European Parliament argues that the "health check" should enable the last round of reforms to be consolidated without reducing further the funding available under the "first pillar" nor applying discriminatory capping to direct aid. Account must also be taken of the special needs of regions in difficulty and of sensitive sectors such as stockfarming, while further simplifying the rules for farmers.
