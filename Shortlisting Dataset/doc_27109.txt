2004/C 783 E/120 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3346/03 by Miquel Mayol i Raynal (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (13 November 2003) Subject: Amendments to the Majorca highway-planning programme The current Majorca regional government (Consell de Mallorca) has decided to amend the island's highway-planning programme (the Plan Director Sectorial de Carreteras) so as to incorporate into it a trunk road to be built between Inca and Manacor, two motorways (linking Inca with Sa Pobla and Llucmajor respectively), the addition of a third lane to the Palma-Inca motorway and the construction of a second ringroad around Palma. These amendments appear in Issue 141 of the Balearic Islands' Official Journal, which was published on 11 October 2003. The amendments are not accompanied by any arrangements for the performance of proper environmental-impact assessment, even though the programme will undoubtedly have a major impact (including the destruction of an extensive rural area) in social, economic, environmental and land-use terms. Is the Commission aware of the programme in question and of the amendments approved by the Majorca regional government, despite the fact that no suitable environmental-assessment plan has been drawn up? What action — if any — is the Commission intending to take? Does the Commission consider that the amendments to the programme constitute a direct attack on Articles 2 and 6 of the Nice Treaty?
