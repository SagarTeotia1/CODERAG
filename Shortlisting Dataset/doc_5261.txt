ORAL QUESTION H-0871/02 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by John Cushnahan to the Council Subject: Recent maritime disasters In light of the series of maritime disasters that have occurred in European waters in November and December 2002, namely the Prestige disaster which continues to produce yet more oil slicks which are devastating the coastline and marine life of Galicia, compounded with the recent collision between the freighter the Tricolor and the Kariba, and the second collision between the wreck of the Tricolor and the freighter the Nicola, will the Council recognise that there is a clear need for a coordinated EU response? Furthermore, given the severe consequences of such maritime accidents, what is the Council's view of the submission that I made to the Convention on the Future of Europe in June 2002 (reference Conv 150/02), calling for the creation of an EU Coastguard?
