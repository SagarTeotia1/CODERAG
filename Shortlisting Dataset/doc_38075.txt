WRITTEN QUESTION E-2263/07 by Aldo Patriciello (PPE‑DE) and Iles Braghetto (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (25 April 2007) Subject: Misuse of Campania regional operational plan (ROP) 2000‑06 funding by Avellino City Council executive Measure 5.1 in the Campania regional operational plan (ROP) for 2000‑06 and the funds made available for PICA (integrated projects for the city of Avellino) projects were subject to a number of procedures with which the Avellino City Council executive should have complied, but failed to do so. Firstly, with a view to preventing any outside bodies from having an opportunity to draw attention to the unlawfulness of the projects being funded, the executive deliberately failed to conduct consultations with local economic, social and environmental stakeholders, while claiming that the consultations had in fact taken place. Secondly, the executive decided to replace the planned projects with others for which no draft plans had even been drawn up, thus misusing funds initially earmarked for other purposes. Thirdly, the executive has repeatedly refused to provide environmental associations and members of the city council with access to documents, in an attempt to hide the dubious legality of its activities behind a wall of silence. Fourthly, public works which will clearly have an adverse impact on the local area have been planned without any formal projects having been put forward. These works cover in particular: — an underpass providing access to the Mercatone and Piazza Libertà car parks, which is an uncalled-for, damaging variation on an earlier tunnel project which was rejected at the time by the appropriate assessment authorities; Far from drawing traffic away from the city centre, this project attracts it into a car park underneath the city's central square; — a road link between Piazzetta Perugini, Via Zingarelli and Strada Statale 7 Bis, requiring the construction of a line of pillars in the Finistrelle area, in which building is prohibited on environmental grounds under the municipal land use plan; — a multi-storey car park in the same protected area as the road link, which will cause further serious environmental damage. Given the above, would the Commission not agree that enquiries should be conducted with a view to establishing who is responsible for this misuse of funds in Avellino, which is in breach of both ROP and PICA objectives and environmental protection obligations?
