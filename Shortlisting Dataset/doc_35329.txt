See also integrated guideline ‘Ensure employment-friendly wage and other labour cost developments’ (No 21). Modification 6 Section A, Chapter A.2, paragraph 6 Guideline. To contribute to a dynamic and well-functioning EMU, euro area Member States need to pay particular attention to fiscal discipline, and in this connection those that have not yet reached their medium-term budgetary objective should pursue an annual improvement in their cyclically-adjusted budget deficit net of one-offs and other temporary measures of 0.5% of GDP as a benchmark, while ensuring a higher adjustment effort in good times; press forward with structural reforms that will improve euro area competitiveness and economic adjustment to asymmetric shocks ; and ensure that the euro area’s influence in the global economic system is commensurate with its economic weight (Integrated guideline No 6). Guideline. To contribute to a dynamic and well-functioning EMU, euro area Member States need to ensure better coordination of their economic and budgetary policies in order to stimulate domestic demand and growth in a concerted fashion, initially by harmonising their budgetary timetables; those Member States that have not yet reached their medium-term budgetary objective should pursue an annual improvement in their cyclically-adjusted budget deficit net of one-offs and other temporary measures of 0.5% of GDP as a benchmark, while ensuring a higher adjustment effort in good times , keeping in mind that, in future, structural reforms will be taken into account when defining the adjustment path to the medium-term objective and temporary deviations from this objective will be allowed for countries that have already reached it ; press forward with structural reforms that will improve euro area competitiveness by investing in innovation, industrial policy, education and professional training and economic adjustment to asymmetric shocks; Member States should complete the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and ensure that it is strictly applied in order to re-establish confidence. Moreover, Member States should ensure the external representation of the euro area in accordance with the commitments made at the Vienna European Council of 11 and 12 December 1998, so that the increasingly important role of the euro in the global economic system is commensurate with its economic weight.
