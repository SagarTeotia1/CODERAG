Article 9 The information obtained at such meetings or during the consultation of such documents on the Council’s premises shall not be disclosed, disseminated or reproduced, either in full or in part, in any form. By the same token, no recording of particulars relating to the sensitive information provided by the Council shall be authorised.

Article 11 Officials duly cleared to have access to sensitive information in accordance with the ‘need-to-know’ principle shall be bound by the requirement to maintain confidentiality. Any official who breaches that rule shall be the subject of an inquiry conducted under the authority of the President and, if appropriate, disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the Staff Regulations (statut des fonctionnaires). Should judicial proceedings be initiated, the President shall take all the measures required to enable the competent national authorities to implement the appropriate procedures. Article 12 The Bureau shall be competent to undertake any revision, amendment or interpretation necessitated by the implementation of this Decision.
