WRITTEN QUESTION P-3812/05 by Mia De Vits (PSE) to the Commission (14 October 2005) Subject: Right of access to the electricity and energy market and coordination of measures to combat social exclusion and poverty In its answer to my Question P‑2578/05, the Commission refers to the European social inclusion process in relation to access to electricity for all, including the most disadvantaged. In this context, can the Commission say how consultations between the Commission services responsible for the energy market and social policy are organised? In the framework of coordinating the fight against poverty and social exclusion, is the Commission prepared to set up specific arrangements for the exchange of information and best practice in this area and, if necessary, to adjust its energy market policy to ensure access to services? Is the Commission prepared to include access to electricity and the energy supply among the common objectives of combating poverty? In its answer the Commission also says that it will attach a great deal of importance to this provision when assessing the conformity of national implementing measures. Can the Commission explain how it will do this, in other words what criteria will be applied?
