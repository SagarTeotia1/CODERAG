ORAL QUESTION H-0152/07 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Zdzisław Zbigniew Podkański to the Commission Subject: Anti-dumping duties on Chinese strawberries In October 2006, the Commission introduced provisional anti-dumping duties on Chinese frozen strawberries, in the light of the dumping prices applied by China and the fact that Polish producers meet 60% of the European processing industry's needs. It is widely reported that the duties will not be extended, which will result in the collapse of many Union producers, particularly in Poland, causing the Union to become dependent on frozen strawberries from China and Morocco. These fears have caused concern among Polish strawberry producers and processors. On 18 February this year, a protest call was issued and an organising committee appointed. The protest action will take place in Poland and the European Union. In the light of this situation, is the Commission aware of the danger posed by any further failure to heed the threats facing Polish and European farmers?
