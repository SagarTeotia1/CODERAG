application. It is feared the UK will simply deport him to Iran. A solution for Mehdi Kazemi … The resolution, adopted by 46 votes to 2 with 12 abstentions, points out that the Iranian authorities "routinely detain, torture and execute persons, notably homosexuals" and that "Mehdi's partner has already been executed, while his father has threatened him with death". It adds that "the EU and its Member States cannot apply European and national laws and procedures in a way which results in the expulsion of persons to a third country where they would risk persecution, torture and death, as this would amount to a violation of European and international human rights obligations". And they stress that the EU directive on qualifying criteria for refugee status (the Qualifications Directive) "recognises persecution for sexual orientation as a ground for granting asylum". In this particular case, therefore, Parliament "appeals to the Member States involved to find a common solution to ensure that Mehdi Kazemi is granted asylum or protection on EU soil and not sent back to Iran". …and for others in future More broadly, MEPs argue that "more attention should be devoted to the proper application of EU asylum law in Member States as regards sexual orientation". They invoke the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits the removal of persons to countries where there is a serious risk that they would face the death penalty, torture or other inhuman treatment, as well as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Geneva Convention. Parliament also asks EU institutions and Member States to take action to prevent similar situations in the future, while acknowledging that the Commission has announced, for 2008, amendments to the Dublin Regulation and the Qualifications Directive which will address the issues raised in this resolution.

The report, by Danute Budreikaite (ALDE, LT) and adopted with 378 votes in favour, 11 against and 16 abstentions, looks at how the new Member States implement their development policy. The House stresses that this policy is a part of the acquis communautaire (the existing body of Community law and policy) and recalls the new Member States' international commitments in this field. It also mentions that promoting democracy and the rule of law - a key priority for the new Member States - also helps reduce poverty in developing countries. These states have undertaken to reach an official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.17 % of gross national income (GNI) by 2010 and 0.33% by 2015.
