entails a cost to the EU equivalent to about 1% of GDP. Working from home, carpooling and car-sharing suggested Parliament is of the opinion that an effective urban mobility policy should take into account the transport of persons as well as of freight and must therefore be based on as fully integrated an approach as possible, bringing together the solutions best suited to each individual problem. The House firmly believes that urban areas have economically sound potential to offer for further modal shift policies in favour of public transport, walking, and cycling and for a new approach to urban logistics. MEPs consider it essential in this connection to focus on technological innovation (wider use of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS's)), better exploitation of existing infrastructure, especially by means of demand management measures (congestion charges and road pricing), and innovative solutions for the optimum integration of urban freight flows; and, lastly, new ways to optimise the use of private cars such as car-sharing, carpooling and arrangements for working at home. To achieve the aim of making European transport sustainable in energy and environmental terms, MEPs consider it necessary to combine different policies with the involvement of more and more stakeholders representing the transport sector, government and citizens. This combination of measures should encompass the following in particular: (a) technological developments (measures to increase energy efficiency; new standards/regulations for engines and fuels, use of new technologies and alternative fuels); (b) market-based instruments (charges/fares based on environmental impact or congestion, tax incentives, Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) allowing for the specific features of the different modes of transport); and (c) flanking measures to enable means of transport and infrastructure to be used as efficiently as possible. The report maintains that the EU and the Member States need to focus their efforts on the key elements of the system, namely congested large cities and urban areas, the main European intercity corridors and environmentally sensitive areas. The Council and the Member States are called upon to step up their investment in infrastructure and ITSs, in particular with a view to: (a) completing the trans-European network priority projects as soon as possible; (b) tackling congestion in urban areas and along corridors in sensitive areas; and (c) improving intermodal transport. MEPs urge the Commission to submit by June 2008 at the latest, a comprehensible, transparent, generally applicable model for assessing the external costs of all modes of transport, on which to base future calculation of the charges to be paid for the use of infrastructure. Rail transport: emphasising that this is the mode of transport which consumes the least energy and produces the lowest level of CO2 emissions, MEPs call on the Commission, the Member States, and the rail industry to: (a) complete a single European railway area or rail market as soon as possible; (b) with that end in view, eliminate the technical obstacles and move towards a single European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and interoperable solutions; and (c) improve freight and passenger transport services and the quality of service.
