WRITTEN QUESTION E-1636/09 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 March 2009) Subject: Abusive and disproportionate application of procedural rules against European citizens in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) The hostile atmosphere created in FYROM against Greece has given rise to incidents in which people, particularly drivers, have been subjected to abusive behaviour, and cars with Greek registration plates have been attacked and damaged. Moreover, the Skopje authorities frequently apply national legislation and the rules under the Stability and Association Agreement between the EU and FYROM concerning customs, taxation, transit transport, exportation of any amount of foreign currency greater than EUR 2 000 (except where declared on entering the country), as well as the highway code, against citizens of a Member State in the strictest possible and clearly abusive manner, with disproportionate consequences. 1. Is the Commission aware of these incidents and the practices pursued by the Skopje authorities against citizens of a Member State of the EU? 2. What view does it take of these actions in the light of FYROM’s application for accession to the EU? 3. Will it instruct its representation in FYROM to provide assistance to European citizens who are in FYROM for personal or professional reasons and are encountering this kind of treatment from the local authorities?
