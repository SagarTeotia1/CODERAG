Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (3 August 2011) The Commission is not aware of the practices referred to by the Honourable Member. As a matter of principle, the Commission's powers regarding acts and omissions by Member States are limited to overseeing the application of Union law, under the control of the Court of Justice of the European Union (cf. Article 17(1) TEU). On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, it does not appear that in the matter referred to the Member State concerned did act in the course of implementation of EC law. Therefore, it is for national authorities to deal with this issue according to the surrounding circumstances and context, and in conformity with relevant national and international law.
