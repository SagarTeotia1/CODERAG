Answer given by Mrs Grybauskaité on behalf of the Commission (10. januar 2005) Although budgetary balances may be seen as a simple way of capturing through a single figure the net financial benefits of being a Member State of the European Union, they fail to capture the real balance of the advantages and disadvantages of belonging to the Union. As already stated in the Commission’s 1998 and 2004 reports on the functioning of the EU’s own resources system ‘Agenda 2000, Financing the European Union, Commission report on the operation of the own resources system’ Supplement 2/98 to the Bulletin of the European Union, available at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/budget/agenda2000/reports_en.htm ; and ‘Financing the European Union, Commission report on the operation of the own resources system’, COM(2004) 505 final, Volume I and II, of 14 July 2004, available at http://europa.eu.int/comm/budget/furtherinfo/index_en.htm . , budgetary flows do not capture all the benefits from membership of the EU. EU membership, which gives rise to financial and non-financial advantages as well as obligations, has a non-budgetary dimension the importance of which dwarfs the budgetary one. For example, the benefits from the pursuit of common objectives, such as trade liberalisation and European economic integration, cannot be evaluated in terms of budgetary flows alone. Moreover, flows from the EU budget invariably benefit not only recipients but other Member States in the form of return flows; typical examples are structural funds and external expenditure, where the implementation of projects often gives rise to purchases of goods and services from other countries. There are, furthermore, several possible methods of calculating budgetary balances, which require making assumptions about four main issues: the items to be included in the calculation of the payments made by Member States to the EU budget; the items to be included in the calculation of EU expenditure in each Member State; the use of cash versus accrual data (including the issue of how to account for the carry over of the unspent balances from previous years); and the possibility of adjusting the resulting set of budgetary balances so that the sum for all Member States adds up to zero. In response to Member States’ demands, the Commission’s Directorate-General for Budget publishes figures on Member States’ balances vis-à-vis the EU budget in its annual report ‘Allocation of EU operating expenditure by Member State” Available at http://europa.eu.int/comm/budget/agenda2000/reports_en.htm . The balances presented in the report are calculated on the basis of the same principles and method There are, however, two main differences between the method used in the report and the method used for the calculation of the UK rebate: a) with a view to publishing budgetary balances as early as possible, the method presented in the report uses cash expenditure data (information available in year n+1 on payments corresponding to payment appropriations for year n and n-1 paid in year n) while the method for the calculation of the UK rebate uses accrual expenditure data (information available only in year n+2 on payments under payments appropriations for year n, paid in year n or carried forward and paid in year n+1), b) in
