ORAL QUESTION H-0185/07 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Glenis Willmott to the Commission Subject: Promoting EU funding in the regions In the UK, as I am sure is the case in other European countries, there is little awareness and recognition of the various ways EU money has been used to regenerate less prosperous regions. EU-funded projects in the regions are among the most visible benefits of EU membership and as such European citizens should be made more aware of the contributions the EU makes to improve their daily lives. What measures does the Commission take to ensure that those receiving structural funds promote and publicise the source of their funding? With a view to bringing the EU closer to the people, does the Commission have any intention to set up a central database, which would hold information on EU funding, classified region by region, allowing citizens to see clearly the money being invested in their region?
