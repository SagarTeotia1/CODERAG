Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (17 May 2011) The European Council of 25 March 2011 concluded that the safety of all EU nuclear plants should be reviewed, on the basis of a comprehensive and transparent risk and safety assessment. At the same time, the European Council called for similar assessments to be carried out in the neighbouring countries and worldwide. For further information on this subject the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the answer on priority Written Question P‑003007/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . Under Article 43 of the Euratom Treaty, the Commission has competence to express its views on investment projects relating to new installations in the EU, or to replacements or conversions of such nuclear installations. Regarding third countries, the Commission expects full respect of these countries’ obligations under international law on nuclear safety and environmental protection. Belarus and Russia are both bound by the Convention on Nuclear Safety and Belarus is a party to the Espoo Convention.
