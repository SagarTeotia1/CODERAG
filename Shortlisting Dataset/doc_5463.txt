WRITTEN QUESTION E-6219/09 by Roberta Angelilli (PPE) to the Commission (11 December 2009) Subject: Possible funding for the preservation and enhancement of Latin through the establishment of an international Latin study centre The international Latin study centre in the town of Montefiascone, province of Viterbo, is a project which seeks to preserve and enhance the Latin language internationally. The aim of the project is to spread public awareness that Latin, although no longer in common use, represents Europe's historic heritage, but also effectively to promote exchanges and cultural enrichment with regard to European citizenship, given that most existing European legislative systems are based on Roman law. The international Latin study centre should pursue this objective by organising conferences and events at the ancient 17th century seminary in Montefiascone, in addition to training courses and cultural exchanges between European students, under the guidance of international experts and Latin enthusiasts. The project also seeks to establish an annual Latin literary competition for young students, on various topics, and to hold residential seminars during the summer holidays for young foreign students who could stay in the ancient seminarists' cells. In order to foster international cultural exchanges, the project also seeks to set up a website to promote the activities of the international Latin study centre and disseminate the material collected, which will be broken down into thematic areas and translated into three different languages. In the light of the above, can the Commission: 1. say whether there is any funding available to carry out this project; 2. say whether any similar projects have been financed by European funds; 3. give a general overview of the situation?
