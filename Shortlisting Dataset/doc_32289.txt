Joint answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-5601/06 , E-5604/06 , E-5603/06 , E-5602/06 , E-5605/06 (30 January 2007) The Commission is aware of the changes introduced in the United Kingdom (UK) legislation to which the written questions refer. In fact, it has received a complaint on the issue. In the framework of that complaint, a letter of formal notice was sent to the UK authorities on 18 October 2006. The reply from those authorities, dated 14 December 2006, is currently being examined by the Commission services. In the light of that reply, the Commission will decide about further steps to be taken on this subject matter.
