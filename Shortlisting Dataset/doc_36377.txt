WRITTEN QUESTION P-2116/09 by Giovanna Corda (PSE) to the Commission (23 March 2009) Subject: Use of Bisphenol A in babies' feeding bottles Since October 2008 Canada has banned the use of Bisphenol A (BPA), an organic compound used in the manufacture of certain plastics from which, among other things, babies’ bottles and containers for use in microwaves are made, because of its harmful effects on the reproductive, neurological and immune systems. In the United States the six largest manufacturers of babies’ bottles are going to stop selling products containing BPA. In France the Réseau environnement santé (environment and health network) is calling for BPA to be banned in plastics that come into contact with food. Can the Commission say whether it has scientific data on the use of this substance, particularly in feeding bottles, and, if so, what measures it plans to take for the protection of consumers, particularly babies, in accordance with the precautionary principle?
