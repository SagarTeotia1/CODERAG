ORAL QUESTION H-0523/02 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Hans Karlsson to the Commission Subject: The UMTS/3G network The extension of the UMTS/3G network is currently being implemented. In order for the project to be profitable, an extension needs to take place to some extent in parallel throughout the whole EU internal market, otherwise operators doing business in several countries will lose the advantages which the global UMTS standard has to offer. One precondition for operators on the market to risk investment in the infrastructure which an extension of UMTS/3G requires is that there should be a common strategy at EU level for the implementation of the regulations currently in force, e.g. the Access Directive. The EU currently lacks such a strategy, which means that the Member States are moving at a very different rate and operators hesitate to make any further progress. A report of the current situation has been requested, but that is not enough. Is the Commission planning to take any concrete measures to encourage and facilitate the Member States' extension of the UMTS/3G network in the course of this implementation?
