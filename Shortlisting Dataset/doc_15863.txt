understanding of the points of view and democratic systems on both sides; 22. Welcomes the fact that the new government of Manmohan Singh has taken important and positive steps with regard to the necessary socio-economic reforms; 23. Welcomes the fact that democratic culture and development in India have attained very high standards, as shown by the proper functioning of coalition governments at federal and state level, and that this is enabling progress to be made towards reform in the economic and social fields which would not otherwise have been possible; 24. Considers nevertheless that, given the enormous complexity and diversity of India's social, economic and political fabric, this will not fully guarantee that the process will not experience difficulties and fluctuating fortunes; 25. Welcomes the release of 450 children between the ages of 6 and 14 who were working illegally in Mumbai under conditions of slavery, secured by the police in June 2005, and the arrest of the 42 unscrupulous businessmen who were exploiting them; nevertheless, expresses its alarm at the UNICEF reports according to which seventeen and a half million children (double that number according to some NGOs) are working in India, mostly in subhuman conditions; commends the new approach seemingly adopted by the Indian police and employment authorities of prosecuting exploiters and urges them to ensure that sufficient resources and continuing political will are available to make it possible to eliminate this shameful scourge on society; Economic issues 26. Notes that the government is pushing for structural change in the economy and that it has made progress in the deregulation of several sectors (mobile telephony, insurance, energy, aviation, etc.); welcomes the fact that the new government's first budget provides for structural improvements, tariff reductions and a lifting of restrictions on foreign ownership, and that it is moving forward with the privatisation of state enterprises; 27. Given that India and the EU share the view that trade, investment and free competition are key factors in economic development, but also that, if such development is to be harmonious and equitable, account must be taken of fundamental social needs which strengthen economic and social cohesion, the environment and consumer rights, urges the Indian Government to pay heed to these matters as it embarks on the vast task of development; 28. With this in view, and given this shared vision, urges the EU and India to jointly tackle aspects of industrial, environmental and development cooperation, trade, investment and good governance policy which are of common interest to both parties, 29. Urges the Indian private sector, which has benefited from the full confidence of the government and is playing a key role in the economic measures and plans drawn up by the government essential to the sustainable development of the country, to display the utmost social sensitivity when participating in these plans; 30. Takes note of the measures announced by the Indian Ministry for Trade and Industry to facilitate exports, including the introduction of a single uniform application form, which could considerably reduce the excessive amount of red tape existing at present; 31.
