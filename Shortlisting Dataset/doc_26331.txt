Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (13 January 2012) The Honourable Member refers to the ‘greening component’ in the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy COM(2011)625/3. . In reply to the first question it has to be emphasised that among the guiding principles for the selection of the measures were annuality, suitability for the administration and control system in place for direct payments, and simplicity. The latter pleads also for limiting the number of measures. The Commission considers that the proposed set of measures enables their implementation in all Member States. As to the second question, the interconnection is formulated in Article 29: Farmers entitled to a payment under the basic payment scheme shall observe the practices qualifying for a green payment. In other words, firstly the eligibility for the basic payment must be ensured, and in a second step the farmer must comply with the greening obligations. If the farmer partly or totally fails to comply with the latter, he shall be sanctioned proportionately taking into account in particular the severity and extent of the non-compliance. This sanction can hence lead in very seriouscases to a total exclusion from the greening payment and can even affect other public aids he receives.
