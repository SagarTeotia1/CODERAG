WRITTEN QUESTION P-2806/07 by Jean-Pierre Audy (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (24 May 2007) Subject: The current situation as regards the anti-dumping tax on polyester fibres from certain countries in Southeast Asia In January 2007 the European Commission put in place a provisional anti-dumping tax on polyester fibres from Taiwan and Malaysia. These provisional measures will remain in force until definitive measures are put in place, which should happen soon. A number of industrialists who are importers of such fibres, including thermofusible polyester fibres, have complaints about the anti-dumping tax, which increases the purchase price of such fibres (of a type apparently not produced inside the European Union) by some 20 %. This situation causes distortions of competition relative to non‑European companies, particularly in China, which are able to distribute their products made from such fibres without this tax burden. Can the Commission say on what economic basis these measures were introduced and whether a study was carried out in advance of putting the tax in place? Does the provisional anti-dumping tax that is currently in force take account of the difference between the traditional polyester fibres produced in Europe and thermofusible polyester fibres, which are not, or is it applied across the board without reference to the specificities of polyester fibres? Can the Commission say how it intends to follow up this anti-dumping tax, and can it give assurances that the tax is not penalising the industry in Europe?
