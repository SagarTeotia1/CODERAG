Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (3 February 2004) The Honourable Member refers to the adverse environmental effects of the amended road plan for the island of Mallorca proposed by the regional government, and the fact that no provision has been made for an environmental impact assessment. First, the Commission would refer to its recent replies to question E-3346/03 by the Honourable Member OJ C 78 E, 27.3.2004, p. 804 . and question E-3865/03 by Isler Béguin See page 107. , which also concern the amended road plan for Mallorca, in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands, Spain. In its replies, the Commission explained that Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment OJ L 197, 21.7.2001 . was not applicable because the deadline for its transposition was 21 July 2004. Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 . does apply, but for the specific road projects that will be developed. In this written question the Honourable Member reports that the amended road plan will have adverse effects on natural habitats and species of Community interest found on the island of Mallorca. Council Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992 . of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna could be applicable in this case. The Commission has asked the Spanish authorities to comment on the application of the abovementioned Directives in this particular case, with a view to determining whether the plan is likely to have a significant effect on a Site of Community Importance (SIC), having regard to the objectives of Directive 92/43/EEC , in which case the provisions of Article 6 apply. In any event, the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will take the necessary measures to ensure that Community law is observed in this instance.
