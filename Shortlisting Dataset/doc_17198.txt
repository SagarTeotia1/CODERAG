Reply (6 April 2009) The Council is conscious of the human dimension of the consequences of the tragic events of 1974 for the population throughout the island of Cyprus. Many issues, including that of missing people, should be considered within the overall context of the Cyprus problem. The Council has expressed its firm intention to support the process launched by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr Demetris Christofias, and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, Mr Mehmet Ali Talat, to reach a fair, comprehensive and viable settlement of the Cyprus problem within the UN framework, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and in line with the principles on which the European Union is founded. The Honourable Member can therefore be assured that the Council remains determined that the Cypriots achieve their common destiny as citizens of a united island of Cyprus within the European Union. As stated in the Council conclusions of 8 December 2008, progress towards Turkey's fulfilment of its obligation of full non‑discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the EC‑Turkey Association Agreement and towards normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus is urgently awaited.
