Question for written answer E-000419/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) (27 January 2011) Subject: Aid to family farming The preliminary data from the latest agricultural census carried out in Portugal in 2009 show that, over the last 10 years, some 112 000 farms, i.e. 25 % of the farms that existed in 1999, have disappeared. Moreover, around 500 000 hectares of land are no longer farmed. It is also common knowledge that three-quarters of Portuguese farms have an area of less than five hectares with only a small number (around 260) being larger than 1 000 hectares, i.e. about 12 % of the total farmland in Portugal. In addition, livestock numbers, in particular as regards pigs and sheep, haven fallen by 20 %. Farmers and their associations blame this on the fact that the CAP takes no account of the interests of family farming or the specific features of Portuguese agriculture. Most farmers are unable to compete with imports, whose volume is constantly increasing, causing Portugal’s food dependency to grow alarmingly and aggravating its trade deficit and foreign debt. 1. What measures are being considered to review this situation and provide vital support for Portuguese family farming, in view of its special features? 2. What measures are planned to protect the food security and sovereignty of EU Member States, including Portugal, where the decrease in agricultural production has increased the country’s food dependency and foreign debt, in addition to heightening inequalities and the rural exodus from inland regions?
