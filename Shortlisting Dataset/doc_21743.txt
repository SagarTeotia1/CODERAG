Joint answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-008571/11 , E-008824/11 , E-008623/11 (8 November 2011) The Commission is convinced that Turkey and the European Union have much more to gain through integration and dialogue than through tension. The EU has also repeatedly underlined the importance of progress in the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all Member States, including Cyprus. The European Union is based on a number of core principles, including good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The EU is committed to this approach, which is the best guarantee for peace and stability. The Commission once again underlines the urgent need to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. A comprehensive settlement would be to the benefit of all Cypriot citizens, the European Union, Turkey and the entire region. In this crucial phase of the settlement talks, it is essential that all parties concerned exert restrain and do their utmost to ensure a positive climate that will facilitate a successful conclusion of the process. Reaching a settlement should be a common priority at this critical point.
