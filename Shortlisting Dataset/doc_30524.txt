Charter; 2. Welcomes the strengthening of representative and participatory democracy arising from the introduction of, inter alia, the so-called "citizens' initiative" (Article 11 of the EU Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon (TEU)), whereby not less than one million citizens from a significant number of Member States may ask the Commission to submit a proposal for a legal act; 3. Welcomes the fact that environmental protection has been given a prominent position in all EU policies and that an explicit reference is made in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to combating climate change at the international level; stresses that Parliament should continue to push the European Union to take a leading role in all policies relating to fighting climate change and global warming; 4. Welcomes the fact that the new TFEU links the building of an area of freedom, security and justice to the protection of fundamental rights and the legal order of the European Union and of its Member States (Article 67 of the TFEU); 5. Takes particular note of the objective of establishing a "highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment" (Article 3(3) of the TEU), thereby linking the aim of completing the internal market with other objectives; 6. Notes with satisfaction that equality between women and men has been included among the Union's values (Article 2 of the TEU) and aims (Article 3(3) of the TEU); 7. Welcomes the fact that, according to Article 208(1) of the TFEU, the "Union's development cooperation policy and that of the Member States complement and reinforce each other", whereas, according to the current Article 177(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, "Community policy in the sphere of development cooperation [...] shall be complementary to the policies pursued by the Member States"; stresses the increased responsibility of Parliament, given that the Union will have a greater role to play in terms of initiative in policy-setting, which should lead to improved donor coordination and division of labour and to greater aid effectiveness for the "reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty" in the context of the Millennium Development Goals; 8. Believes that the inclusion of territorial cohesion as an objective of the Union (Article 3 of the TEU) complements the objectives of economic and social cohesion and that the introduction of legal bases in those respective areas will increase the competence of Parliament to assess the territorial impact of key Union policies; is pleased to note that the special status of the outermost regions is confirmed by Articles 349 and 355 of the TFEU; 9. Welcomes the introduction of horizontal provisions on a high level of employment, social protection, the fight against social exclusion, a high level of education, training and protection of human health, combating discrimination, and environmental protection, which will act as general principles underlying the European Union's policy-making (Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the TFEU); 10.
