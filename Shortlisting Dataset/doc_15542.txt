Assistance (TRA) 5. Stresses that the EC Budget, in its current form, does not allow for the desirable level of visibility, transparency, and flexibility for the disbursement of trade-related assistance (TRA); 6. Considers that the "Aid for Trade" budget line (20 02 03) should be appropriately funded in order to finance horizontal trade-related assistance initiatives, especially in collaboration with multilateral agencies, that complement and offer a real added value to the EC geographical programmes; 7. Stresses that the pledge by the President of the Commission to increase current and planned EC funding to support the trading capacity of developing countries to EUR 1 000 000 000 per year should be implemented with new funding and without resorting to either the relabelling as TRA of aid formerly classified as infrastructure or the inclusion of the support towards ACP countries affected by the sugar reform; 8. Urges the Commission to submit an annual, detailed report to the competent parliamentary committee on TRA programming and spending so that Parliament is informed about TRA-related disbursements in general and the implementation of the "Barroso pledge" in particular; Cooperation with industrialised non-member countries 9. Stresses that according to the 2007 PDB and DB (Draft Budget) the cooperation with industrialised non-member countries (i.e. line 19 05 01) is set to increase by 35,8 % in 2007 to reach EUR 22 000 000; notes that, as justified by the Commission, this increase is appropriate given the extension of the geographical coverage of the new instrument (from 6 to fifteen or possibly 17 countries) and the diversification of its activities; 10. Notes that Parliament should be consulted and express its opinion on the new instrument for cooperation with industrialised non-member countries in accordance with the appropriate procedure; Macrofinancial Assistance 11. Notes that the 2007 Draft Budget (DB) has cut PDB appropriations for macroeconomic assistance (line 01 03 02) by 19.5 % in commitments, from EUR 79 591 000 to EUR 57 201 000, and by 16.71% in payments, from EUR 100 814 000 to EUR 77 694 000 ; 12. Reiterates that Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) should be subject to strict monitoring and conditionality as the EU does not control how beneficiary countries spend the EU's general un-earmarked funds entering their general budget ; regrets that MFA lacks a proper legal basis and continues to be based on ad hoc Council decisions for each operation; underlines, therefore, the need for a co-decided framework regulation on MFA that enhances transparency, accountability, monitoring and reporting systems; 13. Stresses that Parliament should be consulted on MFA proposals in sufficiently good time to allow it to express its views and adopt its opinion according to a normal calendar and procedure; insists therefore that the Council invite Parliament to deliver its opinion on the Commission's MFA-related proposals by way of the "urgency procedure" only when absolutely necessary and after due justification .
