already exist; considers research and development in this area to be an essential part of full implementation of the strategic energy technology plan, and that this calls for additional investment; emphasises that it is necessary to ensure, in this connection, that the results of research are translated into practice at the level of holdings; welcomes the Commission’s proposal to establish a new research framework (Horizon 2020); 58. Calls for budgetary support to be consistent with the €50 billion needed from public and private sources to fully implement the SET plan; 59. Underlines the importance of R&D for the development of low-emission and energy-efficient technologies; calls on the EU to take a leading role in research into climate-friendly and energy-efficient technologies, and to develop close scientific cooperation with its international partners, with a special emphasis on clean and sustainable technologies which will deliver for 2020 under the SET-Plan (the EU’s flagship initiative for low-carbon technologies); emphasises that funds for all types of energy research under the Horizon 2020 initiative must be increased, particularly those for renewable energy; recalls that current financial allocations in the energy area represent only 0.5 % of the EU budget for 2007-2013, and that this is not in line with the EU’s political priorities; Carbon capture and storage 60. Recognises the importance of applying CCS technology, where feasible, if the carbon emission reduction goals are to be achieved at the least possible cost, and acknowledges that procedural delays and financial shortfalls, as well as lack of commitment on the part of certain Member States, are likely to delay achievement of the European Council’s ambition of having up to 12 CCS demonstration projects in operation by 2015; calls on the Commission to publish a CCS Action Plan; recognises that CCS will not be appropriate in all circumstances, even by 2050, and may well be limited to large installations and the avoidance of industrial process emissions; calls for support on breakthrough technologies in other areas in order to increase energy efficiency and lower energy consumption, and provide solutions outside the CCS framework; 61. Calls on the Commission to propose that unspent funds for CCS projects within the European Economic Recovery Programme be reallocated towards alternative CCS demonstration projects; National and s ector -s pecific r oadmaps 62. Notes that the Cancún agreement foresees that all developed countries shall develop low-carbon strategies; 63. Welcomes the production of low-carbon strategies by some EU Member States, but calls on all to produce such strategies no later than July 2013; insists that the Commission should introduce legislative proposals to require their preparation if by the end of 2012 all Member States have not made such a commitment; 64. Calls on the Commission to evaluate the adequacy of such plans with regard to contributing to the Cancún objective of holding the increase in global average temperatures below 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels; 65. Calls on the Commission to ensure that national and sector-specific roadmaps are subjected to independent scrutiny in order to assess whether full account has been taken of the potential use of best
