WRITTEN QUESTION E-5252/09 by Ivo Belet (PPE) to the Commission (26 October 2009) Subject: Jatropha oil as a biofuel By June 2010 the Member States have to submit their national energy plans, mapping out among other things how they will power 10 % of their transport sector from renewable energy sources (including biofuels) by 2020. Sustainability criteria have been established for these biofuels. With this in mind it is worth mentioning that doubts have recently been cast on jatropha oil, which was being proclaimed a few years ago as the biofuel of the future. However, it is now uncertain whether jatropha oil is really sustainable. How is the Commission currently promoting research into, and the use of, jatropha oil? Is the Commission aware of these concerns? And what is it doing about them? Has this issue yet come up in discussions with third countries which have been investing in the jatropha plant for a number of years?
