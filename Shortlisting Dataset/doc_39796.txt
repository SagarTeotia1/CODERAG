WRITTEN QUESTION E-6159/09 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (9 December 2009) Subject: Waste water treatment plants in Greece Directive 91/271/EEC OJ L 135, 30.5.1991, p. 40 . concerning urban waste water treatment requires Member States to ensure that all agglomerations with a population equivalent (p.e.) of more than 2 000 (p.e. is the unit of measurement of the organic pollution representing the average pollution produced per person per day) are provided with collecting systems for urban waste water treatment. Urban waste water from agglomerations with a p.e. of more than 10 000, which is discharged into sensitive areas, their catchment areas or areas which should have been identified as sensitive, must be subject to tertiary treatment. Could the Commission state specifically how many areas in Greece are experiencing problems relating to the existence and operation of waste water treatment plants? Which areas are they? What is the current situation of the 40 urban areas in Greece which discharge their waste water into sensitive areas and which should have had appropriate collecting and treatment systems since 31 December 1998?
