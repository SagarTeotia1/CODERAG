some of the destructive consequences of the revolutions; 6. Notes that, taking advantage of the winds of freedom blowing across the southern shore of the Mediterranean during the Arab Spring, local civil societies sought to free themselves from the excessive control exercised by those in power; advocates tighter sub-regional cooperation and supports this desire for freedom, provided it is accompanied by real democratic progress which enables common values (democracy and human rights, particularly women’s rights, justice and the rule of law, fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech, conscience, religion, association and the media, security, democratic stability, prosperity, a fair distribution of income, wealth and opportunities, good governance and the fight against corruption) to be upheld; with that in mind, also supports the building of local democracy through the decentralisation and institutional reinforcement of local authorities; 7. Stresses that fulfilment of basic human rights, including social and economic rights, should be the corner‑stone of the neighbourhood policy; invites also the EU to elaborate a policy to address the issue of child labour with respect to the ILO Conventions on the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment, namely the age of 15, and on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour; emphasises that access to basic education and vocational training should be guaranteed in line with the MDGs; 8. Emphasises the particular need for EU development and human rights programmes to support civil society, which is a front line player in these processes, and especially women’s and youth organisations; points out that, following the elections to be held in the coming months, work should also be intensified to strengthen the national parliaments that emerge from the polls, in order to enable them to develop their powers of oversight and scrutiny; 9. Insists that the democratisation process should aim to reinforce the rule of law and build democratic institutions, including a functioning parliament representing political pluralism; stresses the vital role of civil society in this process and calls for a clear and transparent mechanism to be put in place that enables the active participation of civil society; 10. Stresses that migration relations between the EU and neighbouring countries are not solely a matter of the EU’s security priorities; calls on the EEAS and the Commission also to pay attention, in their future policies, to human rights protection for migrants and refugees, as well as to the link between migration and development in the southern and eastern partner countries.
