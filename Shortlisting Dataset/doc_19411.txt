Question for written answer E-3584/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) (25 May 2010) Subject: Aid to small cheese producers in Rio de Moinhos (Borba municipality) During a meeting with the author of this question, cheese producers belonging to the Aqua D'Ossa association, in Rio de Moinhos (Borba municipality), voiced their concerns about the future of some 18 artisanal cheese factories, providing direct jobs for around 100 people, in a region with no other job opportunities and where many other undertakings have already had to close down. Despite the difficulties encountered, these small producers have not hesitated to modernise their installations and improve conditions of health and hygiene, generally without any support. At present, however, they are particularly concerned about being required to contribute a substantial amount of money towards the construction of a wastewater treatment plant. These small producers simply do not have the necessary resources to meet this requirement. There is a serious risk that they will be obliged to close down, thereby exacerbating the area's unemployment problem and population drain. Will the Commission state what measures could help to support both the building of the planned wastewater treatment plant and these small cheese factories, given that this concerns a disadvantaged inland area of the Alentejo region, where production activities are scarce and unemployment is constantly rising?
