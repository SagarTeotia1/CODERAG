Question for written answer E-010671/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (18 November 2011) Subject: Financing of waste reduction and treatment The cohesion policy regulations require Member States to draw up national waste reduction and treatment plans compatible with EC law and the climate change mitigation component of the Europe 2020 strategy. The provisions in question, however, are not sufficient to ensure that Member States will, to a large extent, channel their funding for waste-related measures towards three of the lower rungs of the waste management hierarchy, namely avoidance, reuse, and recycling, or, in other words, comply with the resource efficiency plan. On the contrary, Member States can continue to invest on a substantial scale in waste incineration. How will the Commission make Member States shift their focus from continuing subsidies for incineration to waste reduction and reuse?
