Reply (8 September 2010) As set out in the answer to Written Question E‑3386/10 , the Council adopted Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 on 11 May 2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation mechanism OJ L 118 of 12 May 2010, p. 1. , based on Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and guaranteed by the Union budget up to EUR 60 billion. Under that regulation, support can only be granted in exceptional cases, where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurences beyond its control. The Mechanism applies under the same conditions to all euro area Member States. Until now, no Member State has asked for assistance. The European Financial Stability Facility was set up by the 16 Member States whose currency is the euro through an intergovernmental agreement between participating Member States up to EUR 440 billion, through a special purpose vehicle. As the nature and the conditions of this instrument are governed by an intergovernmental agreement between those Member States, the Council is not in a position to provide comments or information on it.
