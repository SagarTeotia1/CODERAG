terrorism and cross-border crime. The EP Civil Liberties Committee backs the plans but wants to beef up the rules on personal data protection. The draft Council decision under consideration - put forward by Germany - seeks to incorporate into Community law the Prüm Treaty, adopted on 27 May 2005 outside the EU framework, initially by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. The treaty strengthens cross-border cooperation on terrorism, crime and illegal immigration and provides for exchanges of DNA data, fingerprints and other information as well as joint police operations. If it is incorporated into EU law there will be guarantees on data protection, which is the weak point of the Prüm treaty. MEPs wary over data protection The Civil Liberties Committee (whose report by Barbara Dührkop Dührkop (PES, DE) was adopted by 31 votes to 2 with 4 abstentions) approves the proposal but wants data transfers under the new decision to be governed by the future framework decision on data protection. MEPs believe transfers should be subject to control by the European Data Protection Supervisor. The committee's report also introduces a clear definition of "personal data" and calls for a ban on exchanging DNA and fingerprints of innocent people.

The EP Civil Liberties Committee supports the proposal, although some Member States in the Council (where unanimity is required) oppose it. Directive 2003/109/EC grants non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU a uniform status throughout the European Union. However, the Member States excluded "beneficiaries of international protection" from the scope of the directive (this term covers two categories: refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the latter being asylum-seekers not covered by the Geneva Convention). The aim of the Commission's proposal is to extend the scope of the existing directive to include "beneficiaries of international protection". Such people would be entitled to long-term resident status after five years of regular residence. This would include the time taken to process their asylum applications. The amended directive would also protect the refugees against deportation (except if they commit a crime). The Civil Liberties Committee backs the Commission proposal but also calls for: - refugees (or protected persons) without access to employment not to be required to show that they have sickness insurance and sufficient "stable resources" to support themselves; - national integration conditions not to be imposed on such persons, given their vulnerability; - measures to ensure that a person who has
