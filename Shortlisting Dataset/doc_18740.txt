proposals for legislation which the Commission intends to present to the European Parliament and to the Council. ( 28 ) In order to build an internal market where policyholders and beneficiaries are properly protected, insurance and occupational pensions undertakings operating in the internal market under the principles of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services are subject to specific Community legislation. To ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and maintain financial stability, that legislation should be capable of being rapidly adapted to market changes affecting those sectors, in particular with regard to financial and technical aspects. ( 29 ) The role of the IC should therefore be adapted, and this Committee should accordingly be renamed "the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee". However, in the occupational pensions field, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee should not address labour and social law aspects such as the organisation of occupational regimes, in particular compulsory membership and the results of collective bargaining agreements. ( 30 ) Since the measures necessary for the implementation of acts covered by Directive 91/675/EEC are measures of general scope within the meaning of Article 2 of Decision 1999/468/EC, they should be adopted by use of the "comitology" procedure provided for in Article 5 of that Decision. ( 31 ) To ensure institutional and legal consistency with the approach taken in other Community sectors, Commission Decision 2004/9/EC of 5 November 2003 OJ L 3, 7.1.2004, p. 34. established the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee in an advisory capacity to assist the Commission in the fields of insurance and occupational pensions. ( 32 ) References to the advisory functions of the IC in Directive 91/675/EEC should therefore be deleted. ( 33 ) Directive 85/611/EEC set up a UCITS Contact Committee, to assist the Commission by facilitating the harmonised implementation of that Directive through regular consultations, promoting consultation between Member States and advising the Commission, if necessary, on amendments to be made to that Directive. ( 34 ) The UCITS Contact Committee may also act as a "comitology" Committee within the meaning of Decision 1999/468/EC to assist the Commission in regard to the technical amendments to be made to Directive 85/611/EEC. ( 35 ) On 3 December 2002, the Council invited the Commission to take steps in order to transfer to the ESC inter alia the function, hitherto held by the UCITS Contact Committee, of advising the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers. ( 36 ) In order to fully implement the model set out in recent Directives in the securities field, in particular Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) OJ L 96, 12.4.2003, p. 16. - which gives to the ESC the function to advise the Commission in the exercise of its regulatory powers, while leaving the organisation of other aspects of the ESC's work to be governed by Decision 2001/528/EC – it is necessary to delete the provisions setting up, under Article 53 of Directive 85/611/EEC, the organisation
