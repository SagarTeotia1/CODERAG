Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (18 June 2009) The programme referred to by the Honourable Member (‘Νέοι ελεύθεροι επαγγελματίες- 2007’ — new freelance professionals for the year 2007) has been financed entirely from the Greek national budget under the responsibility of the Greek Manpower Organisation (‘OAED’), without any EU Funds being involved. In response to a request for information, the Greek authorities have provided the following details: — the closing date set for the receipt of applications in the call was 15 February 2008; the programme is consequently considered ‘closed’ and no new applications can be accepted under it; — the programme was targeted at 6 000 unemployed between the ages of 18 and 64 and has a budget of EUR 62 million; — it is implemented at prefecture level and involves the collaboration of the Greek Citizen's Centres (KEP). For further information on the programme, the Honourable Member may contact the OAED, and in particular the Special Service for Employment Promotion (‘KPA’/Centres for Employment Promotion). Contact details are available on the OAED's website at http://www.oaed.gr/
