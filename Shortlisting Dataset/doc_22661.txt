Question for written answer E-011637/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (8 December 2011) Subject: Hungary's Data Protection Commissioner Hungarian NGOs have come out in opposition to plans by the Hungarian Government to remove the country's Data Protection Commissioner from his post before the end of his term of office. According to NGOs, such an act would constitute a breach of the obligation to ensure the complete independence of the person holding this office. The Hungarian Government would, therefore, be in breach of its obligations under EC law, specifically the Data Protection Directive, according to which the agencies responsible for implementing the directive must exercise their functions in complete independence. Under a new Hungarian law, the work of the Commissioner would be taken over by a National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. The head of this government agency would be appointed by the President of Hungary. What is the Commission's view on the statement made by Hungarian NGOs to the effect that this action would result in unacceptable political influence being exercised in the area of personal data protection in Hungary? Does the Commission plan to launch an investigation of this matter, as called for by Hungarian NGOs?
