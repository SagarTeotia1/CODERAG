WRITTEN QUESTION E-0914/05 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (10 March 2005) Subject: Protecting the Italian language The decision no longer to use Italian at Commission press conferences has placed the issue of language use and the protection of national cultures within the Community institutions back on the agenda. Given that working documents are, in the main, now published in only three languages - namely, English, French and German - and that, after Italian, even French is now becoming increasingly rarely used and working documents are being distributed in only one of these languages instead of all three, can the Commission say: 1. why Italian is no longer used? 2. whether, given the circumstances, it would not agree that a proposal for a uniform law governing elections to the European Parliament should be put forward, stipulating that, in order to stand for election, candidates must know English, French and German and, with a view to the future, Russian and Turkish as well?
