2003, the Commission took the initiative of establishing the African Peace Facility, which entered into force in May 2004. The African Peace Facility (€ 250 million- EDF funded) is specifically designed to support African Peace Keeping deployment and related capacity building at the initiative of the AU and/or African sub-regional organisations. Both the establishment, and the implementation of the African Peace Facility implies enhanced and permanent contact with the UN and has created de facto a growing relationship between the AU, EU and UN. The Commission believes this is one of the best examples of effective multilateralism at play. Today, the cease-fire observation mission in Darfur is being financed to a large extent by the African Peace Facility and is a tangible example of AU/EU/UN co-operation on peace and security in Africa. Likewise, ongoing work on joint battle groups of Member States and their future role in peacekeeping operations should be noted.
