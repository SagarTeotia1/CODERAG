WRITTEN QUESTION P-4293/09 by Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (7 September 2009) Subject: The use of Cohesion and Regional Development Funds from Greece for preventing and mitigating forest fires The recent destructive forest fires in Greece revealed once again the non-existence of an integrated strategy on natural disaster prevention, as well as a severe shortage of funding in necessary methods and equipment for preventing and mitigating risks, especially forest fires. Taking into consideration (a) that the Community Strategic Guidelines on Cohesion (Council Decision 2006/702/EC OJ L 291, 21.10.2006, p. 11. of 6.10.2006) explicitly refer to protection against environmental risks and to risk prevention measures through improved management of natural resources both being a high priority for financial support by Cohesion Policy between 2007 and 2013; (b) that Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 OJ L 210, 31.7.2006, p. 1. governing the European Regional Development Fund defines explicitly the prevention of both natural and technological risks as measures eligible for support; and (c) that in the programming period 2007‑13, risk prevention in general is a greater priority of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and calculations for the 2007‑13 programmes indicate that more than EUR 5.8 billion are planned to be spent on activities in the various areas of risk prevention; I ask the European Commission to answer the following questions. 1a. Has Greece planned to use the Cohesion and Regional Development Funds for the prevention and mitigation of risks and natural disasters during the period 2007‑13? 1b. If so, what amount has been requested in total? What percentage does this amount represent, out of the total funds Greece requested from the Cohesion and the Regional Development Funds? 2a. Has Greece already used any of the above Funds to prevent and combat forest fires? 2b. If so, for what prevention and mitigation measures/methods have these funds been allocated by the Greek Government? 2c. How does the Commission evaluate the measures undertaken and the use of the above funds allocated by Greece for the prevention and mitigation of forest fires during 2000‑06 as well as in 2007‑09? 3a. Is the Commission satisfied with the cooperation among the Mediterranean Member States and the EU on issues relevant to forest fire prevention and combating, as well as civil protection? 3b. Taking into consideration that climate change contributes to the increase of risks for forest ecosystems, while pressure to make profits from land is usually a motive for criminal acts against forests, will the Commission take new initiatives to coordinate Member States' efforts regarding natural disaster prevention, applying the subsidiarity principle as such?
