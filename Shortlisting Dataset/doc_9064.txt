Answer given by Mrs Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (12 June 2008) The Commission is aware of the problems of enforcement of the Council Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directive 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97, OJ L 3, 5.1.2005. on protection of animals during transport and the need for consistency between the EU rules applicable to drivers and the provisions laid down in the scope of the animals' welfare during transport. The Commission is currently undertaking the necessary preparatory work, notably an impact assessment, in order to examine the possibility of bringing forward by the end of this mandate a proposal to revise the Animal Transport Regulation on travelling times and space allowances which takes into account available scientific knowledge. This work is focused on maximum travelling times and the space allowed for animals during transport, as these were unchanged during the discussions to adopt the regulation in 2004. The Commission is collecting data on the trade flows of live animals transported within the Community, since this information is essential to assess the consequences from the social and economic perspective of any new legal obligation. The Commission is intensively working on the evaluation of the animal welfare, public health, economic, social or environmental impacts that a new Regulation is likely to provoke. A questionnaire which will be on line in the forthcoming weeks, addressed to all of the stakeholders concerned will help the Commission to collect their views. Concerning the transport of animals for slaughter, in the Commission's view, movements over long distances should in principle be limited as far as possible due to the related risks to the welfare and health of the animals.
