Considers it essential that the EU fully support, through its revised neighbourhood policy, the aspirations of those who fight for democracy, the rule of law, social justice and human rights, and stresses that mobility is a key component of the new neighbourhood strategy; calls, in this connection, for the EU to fully support the democratisation process by providing not only humanitarian support but also assistance for political, social, economic and cultural reforms; 2. Recalls, in this connection, that the Member States must uphold the principle of ‘non-refoulement’ and make every effort to facilitate the development of an accessible, fair and protective EU asylum system; 3. Believes that the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) creates an opportunity for the EU to effectively meet its objectives and respect its values as laid down in Articles 2, 3, 6, 8 and 21 of the TEU; 4. Calls on the Council and the Commission to set up a structured dialogue with third country authorities in order to develop a win-win approach to mobility, to ease visa formalities, to make greater use of the opportunities offered by the EU Visa Code and progress towards visa liberalisation and to evaluate the existing mobility partnerships, focusing in particular on the effects of the interdependence between development aid, security, regular migration and irregular migration as defined in the Global Approach to Migration; calls for special attention to be paid to ensuring that partner countries do not suffer from a ‘brain drain’; 5. Calls on the Member States and the EU to ratify the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; considers that the review of the ENP should facilitate the adoption of specific measures in these fields; agrees with the Commission’s observations concerning the situation with regard to migration for family reasons, and welcomes its forthcoming Green Paper on the subject; 6. Takes the view that it is essential, as part of a coherent long-term strategy, to analyse the deep-rooted causes of migration flows in order to arrive at more appropriate responses in relation to the right to mobility; 7. Calls on the EU to enhance the accessibility and channelling of EU funds into projects aimed at informing migrants of their rights and responsibilities and at protecting their rights, with particular reference to the rights of unaccompanied minors, women and other vulnerable groups; asks the Commission therefore to provide Parliament with a detailed report on the use of EU funds earmarked for neighbouring countries, including under the Commission’s thematic programme for
