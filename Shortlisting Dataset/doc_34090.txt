Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (7 January 2005) 1. On 24 October 2004 the Commission adopted seven decisions requiring certain Landesbanks to repay illegal aid totalling some €4 billion (including interest) to the Länder concerned. The decisions stipulate that the repayments are to be made forthwith and call on Germany to notify the Commission within two months of the measures taken to comply with them. The Commission will examine the measures to ensure that in all cases the aid has been effectively repaid (in cash). A number of Länder have informed the Commission that, after the aid has been repaid, they intend to provide the Landesbanks concerned with fresh capital. The exact time horizon for the individual investments has not yet been spelt out. After receiving all the relevant documents, the Commission will examine these plans to check their compatibility with Community law. For this, it will have to take into account the specific features of each individual case. 2. As part of the procedure involving Bankgesellschaft Berlin AG (BGB), which was terminated in February 2004, the Commission examined the ‘repayment agreement’ concluded between the Land of Berlin and the Landesbank Berlin (LBB), which belongs to BGB. In the event of a repayment decision - something which was not yet certain at the time – in the LBB case, the agreement provides for a reorganisation grant from the Land to the value necessary to prevent the threatened repayment requirement from forcing LBB and/or the BGB group to fall below the capital ratios specified in the agreement. The Commission has approved this agreement as additional restructuring aid, but subject to further compensatory measures; this applies above all to the commitment to sell Berliner Bank.
