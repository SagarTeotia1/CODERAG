Welcomes the Commission’s intention to place the emphasis on implementing the Action Plan on Financial Services (APFS) and points out that the Commission is accountable to Parliament as regards the implementing measures taken under the comitology procedure; regards the approach based on the consultation of market actors, including consumers and small investors, as entirely conducive to the effective preparation of future Community legislation, but urges the Commission to speed up its preparatory work in areas which have already been identified, such as rating agencies, hedge funds, retail financial services, the harmonisation of supervisory practices at European level and the transparency of the European securities market and post-market activities; 12.
