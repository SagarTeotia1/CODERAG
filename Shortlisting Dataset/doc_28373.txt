Answer given by Baroness Ashton on behalf of the Commission (5 November 2008) Competition policy is an essential tool to ensure that markets are not distorted and that consumers are not harmed by anti-competitive practices by companies, such as cartels or abuse of dominant positions. Therefore, the Cariforum economic partnership agreement (EPA) contains a limited number of common principles to prevent anti-competitive conduct by companies. The commitments undertaken by the Cariforum States take into account the development level of the economies in the region. The Cariforum countries themselves fully recognise the need for competition policies both at the national and at a regional level. As a matter of fact, in the region, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dominican Republic, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Guyana, as well as Jamaica and Barbados, already have competition laws in place, and the latter two have competition agencies. Several Cariforum States are in the process of adopting national competition laws. Most importantly, the regional enforcement agency, the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Competition Authority, has now been inaugurated in Suriname and is operational. Recognising that setting up a competition policy requires significant resources, the Cariforum Agreement provides for technical assistance by the EU to build capacity and match EPA provisions to future Cariforum plans. This was a particular focus in the negotiations on competition issues. The Commission, therefore, disagrees with OXFAM and South Centre on the logical grounds that it is not possible to describe negotiations that focus on capacity building as premature on the basis that capacity in the area under negotiation is lacking.
