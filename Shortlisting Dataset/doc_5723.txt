ORAL QUESTION H-0413/06 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Papastamkos to the Commission Subject: Doha Round negotiations and the Commission's position The Commission has – correctly – attributed the deadlock in the Doha Round negotiations within the World Trade Organisation to a lack of flexibility on the part of non-EU industrialised States and the emerging economies. The Commission considers the conditional offer of October 2005, including the agricultural sector, to be credible and significant. Moreover, while leading third-country trading partners continue to be intransigent in their positions, the EU continues to come under pressure to make further unilateral concessions in the agricultural sector. Are reports that a new offer in the agricultural sector is to be made in order to take the negotiations forward correct? Does the Commission intend to ask the Council for a new negotiating mandate? Does it intend to propose convening a summit meeting (at the level of Heads of State and Government) in order to salvage the Doha Round?
