WRITTEN QUESTION E-1931/10 by Diogo Feio (PPE) to the Commission (26 March 2010) Subject: Ladies in White: fresh attacks and intimidation According to the Spanish newspaper ‘ABC’, around 200 sympathisers of the Cuban Government led by Raúl Castro hurled insults at a group of Ladies in White, the wives and mothers of political prisoners, who were demonstrating in the streets of Havana. These incidents occurred outside the church of San Juan, when the Ladies in White had left the church and were heading for the city centre, offering flowers to passers-by. While supporters of the dictatorship were targeting their rage at the Ladies in White — who were forced to take refuge in the house of one of the activists, since they feared for their physical safety — a man whose identity is not known was detained by the police for shouting ‘Down with the dictatorship!’ This action by the Ladies in White was part of a week of protests to mark the seventh anniversary of the Black Spring, a wave of repression that led to the arrest of 75 opposition supporters, 53 of whom are still in prison. 1. Is the Commission aware of these incidents? Has it made any formal protest or request for clarification to the Cuban authorities? 2. What steps will it take to put an end to the constant threats and intimidation directed at the Ladies in White? 3. What steps will it take to persuade the Cuban authorities to allow the Ladies in White to come and receive the 2005 Sakharov Prize, which has still not been presented?
