Question for written answer E-001783/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (3 March 2011) Subject: Ban on battery cages for laying hens In 1999 the EU voted for the directive that banned the use of the old system of battery cages from 1 January 2012 and the sale of eggs from battery hens. The new system which will replace battery cages, the so-called ‘enriched cages’, provides the laying hens with a slightly larger space, a nest-box and a perch. While this new system does not bring about a spectacular change or significantly improve the lives of the birds, it does provide slightly better living conditions. In certain Member States a number of egg producers have delayed meeting the deadline of 1 January 2012 for ending the use of the old batteries. Although egg producers have had a full 12 years to prepare for the transition to the new system, some claim that they have not had enough time to carry out the change within the deadline, something that undermines the credibility of European legislation. I ask the Commission: 1. How does it intend to force the Member States whose egg-producing sector has held back, to take measures to ensure that the ban on the old system of battery cages will be fully applied throughout their territory without further delays or exceptions, on 1 January 2012? 2. Since the EU takes the welfare of animals seriously and responsibly, what other measures is the Commission envisaging in order materially to improve the living conditions of laying hens?
