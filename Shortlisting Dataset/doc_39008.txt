The President of the European Parliament and the special committee may ask to consult the documents in question on the premises of the Council. Where this is appropriate and possible in the light of the nature and content of the information or documents concerned, these shall be made available to the President of the European Parliament, who shall select one of the following options: (a) information intended for the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy; (b) access to information restricted to the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy only; (c) discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, meeting in camera, in accordance with arrangements which may vary by virtue of the degree of confidentiality involved; (d) communication of documents from which information has been expunged in the light of the degree of secrecy required. These options are not applicable if sensitive information is classified as "TRÈS SECRET/TOP SECRET". As to information or documents classified as "SECRET" or "CONFIDENTIAL", the selection by the President of the European Parliament of one of these options shall be previously agreed with the Council. The information or documents in question shall not be published or forwarded to any other addressee. 4.
