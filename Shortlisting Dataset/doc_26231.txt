Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (28 October 2003) The Commission's concerns derived from its examination of the way in which the impact of the Kildare Bypass motorway project on an internationally important wetland, Pollardstown Fen, and an associated aquifer were assessed. More specifically, despite advice from the statutory nature conservation authority that the information provided by the developer was seriously deficient, certain important studies on the likely impacts were only undertaken after the decision approving the project was already taken. Whilst the Commission did not challenge the specific project, it decided to challenge the underlying approach taken on the basis that it was not compliant with the requirements of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 . .
