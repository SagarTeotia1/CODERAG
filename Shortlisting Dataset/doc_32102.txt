WRITTEN QUESTION E-3466/04 by Hynek Fajmon (PPE-DE) to the Commission (20 December 2004) Subject: Application of EU wine-making legislation in the Czech Republic On Monday, 6 December 2004, wine‑makers staged a protest in Brno (Czech Republic). They were protesting against EU rules which complicate the work of wine‑makers, and of small wine‑makers in particular. The Czech Government drafted the legislation, i.e. the Wine Act and the amended Excise Duty Act, in the context of EU requirements. In view of this, I would like to ask the following questions: What are the precise EU requirements for wine‑makers? Do these requirements differ for individual Member States? Does the Commission require the precise application of wine‑making legislation in each Member State without the possibility of adaptation? Has the Czech Republic raised the possibility of introducing the category ‘small wine‑maker’, with specially adjusted conditions, as a specific type?
