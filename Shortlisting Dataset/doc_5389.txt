K, L, M and N) (3b) TYPE-APPROVAL OF STAGE IV ENGINES (ENGINE CATEGORIES K, L, M and N) Justification For greater clarity, Stage III A becomes Stage III and Stage III B becomes Stage IV. This also makes it clear that Stage IV is another genuine stage of reduction with new requirements. Amendment 14 ARTICLE 1, POINT 6 Article 9, paragraph 3c (new), heading (Directive 97/68/EC) (3c) TYPE-APPROVAL OF ENGINES USED IN INLAND WATERWAY VESSELS (ENGINE CATEGORIES V) (3c) TYPE-APPROVAL OF STAGE III OF ENGINES USED IN INLAND WATERWAY VESSELS (ENGINE CATEGORIES V) Justification To clarify that a second stage for inland waterway vessels has been introduced. Amendment 15 ARTICLE 1, POINT 6(b) Article 9, paragraph 3d (new) (Directive 97/68/EC) (3d) TYPE-APPROVAL OF ENGINES USED IN INLAND WATERWAY VESSELS (ENGINE CATEGORIES V) Member States shall refuse to grant type-approval for engine types or families and to issue the document as described in Annex VI: – V1:1: after 31 December 2009 for engines of a power output above 37 kW and a swept volume below 0.9 litres per cylinder, – V1:2: after 30 June 2009 for engines with swept volume at or above 0.9 but below 1.2 litres per cylinder, – V1:3: after 30 June 2009 for engines with swept volume at or above 1.2 but below 2.5 litres per cylinder and an engine power output of :37 kW ≤ P < 75 kW, – V1:4: after 31 December 2010 for engines with swept volume at or above 2.5 but below 5 litres per cylinder, – V2: after 31 December 2010 for engines with a swept volume above 5 litres per cylinder, where the engine fails to meet the requirements specified in this Directive and where the emissions of particulate pollutants from the engine do not comply with the limit values as set out in the table in section 4.1.2.5 of Annex I”. Justification Introduction of a second stage for inland waterway vessels for reduction of NOx. There is still a great potential for reducing emissions in inland shipping, which must definitely be exploited on environmental grounds! In the Netherlands, for example, internal waterway vessels are responsible for up to 40% of total NOx emissions. The SCR technology which makes this possible is already available and will be used from 2008 for HGVs and is already in use on Swedish Baltic ferries. Amendment 16 ARTICLE 1, POINT 6(b) Article 9, paragraph 3e (new) (Directive 97/68/EC) (3e) TYPE-APPROVAL OF STAGE III engines for use in railway cars and locomotives (ENGINE CATEGORIES R) Member States shall refuse to grant type approval for engine types or families and to issue the document as described in Annex VI, and shall refuse to grant any other type approval for non-road mobile machinery in which an engine, not already placed on the market, is installed: R1: after 31 December 2005 for engines of a power output below 560 KW, R2: after 31 December 2006 for engines with a power output above 560 KW, where the engine fails to meet the requirements specified in this directive and where the emissions
