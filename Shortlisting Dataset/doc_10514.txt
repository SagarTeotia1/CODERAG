WRITTEN QUESTION E-1020/05 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (16 March 2005) Subject: European Commission's proposals for a conversion scheme under its sugar regime proposals Paragraph 2.2.5 of the Commission's July 2004 proposals on reform of the Sugar Regime (COM(2004) 499 final) outlines the Commission's thinking about a conversion scheme starting in 2005/06 for factories that are no longer economically viable in the light of price reductions and whose quota is not taken up by another operator. Such a scheme would be designed to assist in ‘restoring the good environmental condition of the factory site and the redeployment of the workforce’. What precise obligations would the scheme entail with regard to the ‘redeployment of the workforce’ and restoring the ‘good environmental condition of the factory site’? When will the Commission be coming forward with formal proposals on this scheme? Would the scheme apply to plants that close before the reforms are agreed?
