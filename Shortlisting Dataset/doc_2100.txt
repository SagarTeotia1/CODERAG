particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Commission has presented an action programme aimed at combating the global problem of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and identifying various strategies to be implemented. Most aid measures are directed at development or on primary care, direct supply and distribution of medicines and massive vaccination campaigns. In addition to other actions to fight the poverty-related diseases, notably the Community contribution to the Global Health Fund, research and development activities form an important and complementary part of the Community strategy in this area. Under 5th framework programme for research, some €100 million were devoted to research on these diseases. The Commission proposes a new initiative to support a long-term research partnership between EU member states, Norway and developing countries by providing €200 million for the years 2003-2007 for the development of new clinical interventions to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries. For the first time, the Commission proposes the use of Article 169 of the EC Treaty to allow participation of the Community in member states’ national research and development programmes. By creating the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), the goal is to accelerate the development of new medicines and vaccines against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The EDCTP aims at better coordinating and hence increasing the impact and efficiency of national research programmes. The Commission is facilitating the establishment of the joint programme EDCTP. The Member States and Norway will strive to co-ordinate their research activities, identify synergies and avoid duplication. The participating states will create a European Economic Interest Grouping (EDCTP-EEIG) as the legal entity to execute the EDCTP Programme. Budgetary aspects The total financial volume of the EDCTP programme is €600 million. The Commission has proposed to contribute €200 million under the 6th framework programme for research. In line with the initial breakdown of the 6th framework programme, the Community contribution shall be paid from the appropriation B6-611 allocated to the priority theme “Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health” of the specific programme “Integrating and strengthening Community research”. Further €200 million stem from participating countries’ national clinical research programmes and the remaining €200 million will be acquired from other donors and industry.
