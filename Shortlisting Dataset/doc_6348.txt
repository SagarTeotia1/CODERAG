Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (25 August 2010) The Digital Agenda for Europe places a significant degree of importance to the development of eProcurement in the European Union. Indeed, references to electronic public procurement can be found in different priorities of the Digital Agenda, but in particular under the headings relating to ‘eGovernment’ and ‘interoperability’. Thus, the Commission plans to define by 2011 the concrete steps in a White Paper on how to inter-connect e-procurement capacity across the single market. As a first step, the Commission plans to publish a Green Paper which will identify the improvements that are needed to the EU legal and policy environment to support the emergence of inter-operable e-procurement capacity across the single market. This will encompass challenges linked to electronic submission of tenders. The Commission hopes that all interested parties will take the opportunity to provide their views and input on the outstanding challenges, and the most effective solutions for tackling them. As also mentioned in the Digital Agenda for Europe, the Commission will adopt in 2010 a European Interoperability Strategy and European Interoperability Framework, drawn up under the ISA programme (Interoperability solutions for European Public Administrations). Based on a joint vision, the strategy sets out a common and coherent approach to interoperability. The framework provides guidance to European public administrations in the definition, design and implementation of European public services. The Commission is already supporting work towards interoperable eProcurement across borders in the pilot project ‘PEPPOL’ (Pan-European Public Procurement Online) under the CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Programme).
