Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (7 January 2005) In December 2003 the Commission submitted to the 133 Committee a working document on an EU origin marking scheme with the aim of launching the debate following renewed interest shown by some Member States and industries http://trade-info.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2004/february/tradoc_115557.pdf . In January 2004, the Commission contacted European industry federations, trade unions and consumer associations as well as other Institutions and several meetings took place, both at a bilateral and multilateral level. Member States were invited to consult industry at a national level. The results of the consultation process were submitted to the 133 Committee on 25 June and 2 July 2004. As reported in the Commission’s document ‘Consideration of an EU Origin Marking Scheme http://trade-info.cec.eu.int/doclib/html/118123.htm –Consultation Process, Analysis and Next Steps’ there are a wide variety of views on the issue. A scheme covering all products did not command much interest. However, some industrial sectors displayed a strong interest in a possible EU initiative. The replacement of existing voluntary national origin marking (e.g. ‘made in UK’, ‘made in France’) as well as other types of labelling involving regional indications of origin were not discussed. Following the conclusions of the Presidency in the 133 Committee 2 July 2004, the Commission will pursue the analysis of the implications of any such scheme on a sectoral basis, following further consultations, and may submit a specific recommendation along the lines foreseen in the last submission.
