Question for written answer E-008642/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Dominique Vlasto (PPE) (29 September 2011) Subject: Traceability and origin of products on the Internet The European Union recently underwent a major food and health crisis due to the outbreak of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), which began in Germany and spread to several European countries. Thanks to existing EU rules on the traceability and origin of products in the chain of physical food distribution, the authorities were able swiftly to determine the cause of the epidemic, moving upstream from the end consumer to the producer. If the incriminated products had been sold on the Internet, can the Commission guarantee that the product would have been equally traceable and that liability, throughout the value chain, could have been established in the same way, and just as swiftly?
