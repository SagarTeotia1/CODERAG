Further to written question P-2368/01 , the Commission opened an own initiative case on the issue raised by the Honourable Member and a letter was sent to the Italian authorities to request information on the issue. This letter expressly requested whether the hydrogeological impact of the project was correctly taken into account under the environmental impact assessment procedure carried out and whether the project is likely to seriously jeopardise the conservation of the habitats and species, and in particular of priority habitats and species, within the concerned sites. No written reply has been received yet. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate steps in order to ensure the observance of Community law.
