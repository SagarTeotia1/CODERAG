ORAL QUESTION H-0219/02 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Pat Gallagher to the Council Subject: International adoptions and Romania In June 2001 the Romanian Adoption Committee stopped referring children to international adoption foundations and suspended the registration of new foreign families requesting international adoption for at least one year. Will the Council state what steps it is taking to seek the lifting of the moratorium on international adoptions in Romania, and is it satisfied that enough is being done to integrate childcare policy with other sectoral policies?
