2004/C 58 E/225 WRITTEN QUESTION P-2951/03 by Brice Hortefeux (PPE-DE) to the Commission (2 October 2003) Subject: Draft REACH regulation The recent Internet consultation on the Commission's draft regulation concerning the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH) elicited over 6 300 contributions. The vast majority of contributors expressed concern about the financial and bureaucratic implications of these measures for the European chemical industry, and also about the damaging impact on competitiveness, employment and European know-how. SMEs in the chemical industry will be particularly affected. The knock-on effect will mean that the economic impact on sectors downstream from the chemical industry will be strongly felt across the board. The cessation or relocation of certain production activities, combined with the desire to avoid excessive red tape in Europe will lead some operators to downsize and/or relocate some of their R & D expertise in the long term. Lastly, the registration of polymers on the basis of the options laid down by the regulation could stifle innovation in a field whose vibrancy is almost unrivalled. Two independent studies have found that, if implemented in its current form, the proposal would jeopardise 1,7 million jobs in Germany and 670 000 jobs in France (between now and 2012). Given that the expected health and environmental benefits do not appear sufficient to justify the threats to the competitiveness of Europe's chemical industry, would the Commission be prepared to ask an impartial body to assess the impact of this new legislation before it is formally presented?
