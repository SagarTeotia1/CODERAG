WRITTEN QUESTION E-3956/08 by Vural Öger (PSE) to the Council (14 July 2008) Subject: Eastern partnership — regional forms of cooperation in the European neighbourhood After setting up the Union for the Mediterranean there is now reflection at European level on setting up an Eastern European Union. The debate includes the idea of setting up a Union for the Black Sea. Sweden and Poland presented a working paper entitled ‘Eastern Partnership’ in May 2008, which proposes closer cooperation between the EU and Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and Byelorussia. What is the Council’s view of the proposal for an EU–Eastern European Union? Will the Council call on the Commission to draw up, — as for the Union for the Mediterranean — practical proposals for such a partnership in the form of a Communication? Does the Council take the view that the Union for the Mediterranean should be the model for this and that the focus should be on project-related cooperation in the case of the Eastern European Union as well? Does the Council have a preference when it comes to nomenclature? What is the Council’s position of principle on the creation of various ‘unions’?
