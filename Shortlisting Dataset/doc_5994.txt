Approves the Commission proposal as amended; 2. Calls on the Commission to refer the matter to Parliament again if it intends to amend the proposal substantially or replace it with another text; 3. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and Commission. Text proposed by the Commission Amendments by Parliament Amendment 1 RECITAL 5 A (new) (5a) Democratic accountability and transparency must be inherent in the Lamfalussy process and its extension, which can only be sufficiently guaranteed by respecting the inter-institutional balance with regard to implementing measures. Justification It is vital to ensure that a proper degree of democratic accountability is injected into the extension of the Lamfalussy process. The proposed compromise amendment inserts into this recital the reference to the need to have an appropriate inter-institutional balance for the extension of the Lamfalussy process as well as for the Lamfalussy process itself. The proposed compromise amendment also changes "delegated" to "implementing" to reflect the current Treaty arrangements. Amendment 2 RECITAL 5 B (new) (5b) This Directive amending Directives 73/239/EEC, 85/611/EEC, 91/675/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 93/6/EC, 94/19/19/EC, 98/78/EC, 2000/12/EC, 2002/83/EC, 2002/87/EC and 2001/34/EC only aims at certain changes in the organisational structure of committees. None of the modifications extends the powers to adopt implementing measures vested in the Commission in these directives, nor the powers vested in the Council in Directive 93/6/EC . Justification Without this clarification there would be a risk that the application of the Lamfalussy procedure to these directives would be used
