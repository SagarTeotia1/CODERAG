Question for written answer E-4867/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Angelika Werthmann (NI) (2 July 2010) Subject: Direct trade with northern Cyprus: legal basis On 1 March the Commission forwarded to Parliament the proposal for a regulation on direct trade between northern Cyprus and EU countries (COM(2004)0466) and asked it to treat the regulation as a priority under the ordinary legislative procedure for the implementation of the common commercial policy (CCP) which was introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. The legal basis for this regulation is Article 207 of the TFEU (ex 133 of the TEC). Article 207 governs trade relations with third countries. A Council legal opinion has already pointed out that this article cannot be used as the legal basis for this regulation, which must, rather, be based on Article 1(2) of Protocol No 10 to the Act of Accession. Does a regulation based on Article 207 not imply recognition of northern Cyprus as a third country?
