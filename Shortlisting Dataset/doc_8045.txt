Question for written answer E-009596/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (24 October 2011) Subject: VP/HR — NATO attacks on civilians in Kosovo Albanian Muslims comprise 94 % of the resident population of Kosovo. The last remaining Serbian Christians, who refused to leave their homes, are subjected to continual pressure and violence. Some 150 monasteries and churches have been destroyed since 1999. Another violent incident driven by ethnic and religious motivations took place in Orahovac on 3 October 2011, leaving one man dead and his son seriously injured. Even more serious, however, is the attack carried out by KFOR on 27 September 2011. ‘Friendly’ fire was opened on civilians demonstrating peacefully against the attempt by the Muslim government in Pristina to take control of North Kosovo, a predominantly Christian area. Four demonstrators were injured. I consider it unacceptable for NATO to adopt such a position in favour of the Albanians, which is certainly not conducive to peace and stabilisation in the area. In addition, given that: — the Serbs are continuing to put up barricades, which are continually dismantled by NATO forces in Kosovo; and that — KFOR, with its attack of 27 September 2011, has failed to comply with UN Resolution 1244 on the neutrality of international missions to Kosovo, can the Vice-President/High Representative say how she intends to address the issue of Kosovo, and whether, in the current climate of tension, the EU intends to adopt a strong, decisive position on the subject?
