WRITTEN QUESTION E-6370/08 by Martin Callanan (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (25 November 2008) Subject: The Commission's investigation into ‘splash and dash’ US biodiesel subsidies The Commission is currently carrying out an investigation into the so-called ‘splash and dash’ US subsidies of biodiesel. This subsidy programme came to an end as part of the recent US bailout package. However, what assurance can the Commission give that the inquiry will be carried out in full regardless of the end of this particular subsidy regime? To what extent can US-made biodiesel still qualify for US export subsidies? What fears does the Commission have that the US authorities can still compete unfairly with European biodiesel producers? What steps is the Commission taking to express its concern to the US authorities?
