WRITTEN QUESTION E-1403/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (14 April 2005) Subject: Defective yoghurt on Greek market In February and March 2005, defective yoghurts made by a Greek company were marketed in Greece and other countries without the responsible authorities assessing or managing the risk to public health or activating the rapid alert system to notify consumers and the Commission. The result of concealing the problem for days was that ambiguous information began to circulate as to the danger posed by the food concerned and the quantity supplied to the domestic market and markets in other countries. According to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1 . , where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a food may present a risk to human health, public authorities shall take appropriate steps to inform the general public of the nature of the risk to health and, where the product has reached the consumer, effectively and accurately inform consumers of the reasons for its withdrawal. Can the Commission say why the competent Greek authorities did not activate the rapid alert system pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and whether it considers that failure to constitute an infringement of the regulation? What is the Commission's general assessment of whether Greece correctly implements food safety legislation? Does the Commission consider that there is inadequate compliance? Where do the shortcomings lie and what measures will the Commission take to ensure that Greece complies with Community food safety law?
