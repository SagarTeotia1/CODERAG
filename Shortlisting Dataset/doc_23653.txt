Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (14 May 2007) 1. The Commission reported on Albania's progress in human rights fields, including the prevention of torture, ill-treatment and the prison system, in its last annual progress report in November 2006. The Commission uses its regular contacts with the Albanian authorities to underline the importance of implementing and enforcing existing measures to ensure that Albanian law enforcement bodies comply with their human rights obligations. The Commission expects Albania to fulfil its European partnership priorities. The European partnership calls on Albania to ensure that detainees and prisoners on remand are treated in accordance with international standards and to guarantee that human dignity and personal safety is respected in detention centres and prisons in accordance with international conventions. 2. The Commission provides financial support to help Albania improve conditions for detainees and the respect of their rights. This support includes construction of new prison buildings and awareness-raising and training programmes for the police and the judiciary. This support should help progressively to improve the standards applied in places of detention.
