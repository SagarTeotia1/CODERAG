WRITTEN QUESTION E-2287/07 by Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (27 April 2007) Subject: Poland The Polish government recently endorsed criminal charges against General Wojciech Jaruzelski on grounds of ‘crimes committed under communism’. He now risks 15 years' imprisonment under Poland's penal code. These charges are only the latest in a series of measures by the Polish government or individual members of it. I remind the Commission of the xenophobic and homophobic remarks by Vice-President Roman Gyertich and his father Maciej Gyertich, who was recently reprimanded by the President of the European Parliament for an anti-semitic publication. 1. Does the Commission intend to intervene directly with the Polish government so as to put an end to this spiral of intolerance? 2. What action will the Commission take to ensure compliance with Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, which states that ‘the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy [and] respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms’?
