ORAL QUESTION H-0324/09 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2009 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Frank Vanhecke to the Council Subject: Frontex and illegal immigration At their meeting of 21 September 2009, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers discussed ways of strengthening the role of Frontex, particularly in the Mediterranean region. The official press release mentions partnerships with third countries, tighter checks at the external maritime borders, systematic involvement of Frontex in joint return flights and the establishment of specialised regional Frontex offices. What is the Council's position on the French proposal for a new doctrine for maritime operations by Frontex that would, among other things, give Frontex the power to pick up illegal immigrants on the high seas? How are these proposals being developed further?
