Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (18 January 2012) As the largest donor of financial aid to the Palestinian people, the EU constantly monitors the humanitarian and economic situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. The EU is particularly concerned about the situation in Gaza and has consistently called for the immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of Gaza crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons from and to the Gaza strip. Economic and trade relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are regulated by the Paris Protocol, which is an annex to the Oslo Accords and the Commission monitors the implementation of the Protocol by the signing parties. The model established in the Protocol is known as a ‘customs union,’ which foresees an absence of economic borders between members of the union. The common external tariff and other elements of commercial policy are those of Israel although the Palestinian Authority is allowed to set its own tariff and standards for a limited quantity of goods, mainly consumer goods traded with Jordan and Egypt. In the case of machinery and unfinished goods, the Palestinian Authority is allowed to set its own customs duties and no limit was set on the quantity imported or that could be re-exported to Israel. The Commission has been working on the implementation of a package of measures approved by the Union for the Mediterranean Trade Ministers in 2010 aimed at facilitating Palestinian trade. Following the signature, in October 2011, of an agreement on the liberalisation of trade in agricultural, processed agricultural, fish and fishery products, the EU is opening its market to Palestinian exports without any restrictions for a period of 10 years. In addition, the EU fully supports the objective of the Palestinian Authority to become an observer in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and has been active in promoting the Palestinian Authority as a new member of the Agadir Agreement.
