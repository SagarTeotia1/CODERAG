Question for written answer E-005598/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (14 June 2011) Subject: Helping to combat pollution by putting an end to free plastic bags To combat environmental pollution and reduce the costs associated with the use of plastic bags, China has banned them from being provided free. Although the methods used in that country are not in line with European practice, it seems that the ban has had positive results given that, prior to 2008, China’s consumption of plastic bags stood at 3 billion per day . In Europe, pollution caused by plastic bags is a particularly serious issue for the Mediterranean, and pre-emptive measures are required to avoid serious problems in future. In general, it is not customary in northern European countries for customers to be offered free plastic bags for their purchases, as they are in southern European countries. Obviously, a policy of not providing free plastic bags could greatly reduce pollution. Does the Commission plan to take action to harmonise the Member States’ practice in this area so as to reduce the pollution caused by plastic bags?
