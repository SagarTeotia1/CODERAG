(‘EBIC’) to ‘identify and implement appropriate solutions to ensure proper understanding and comparability of bank fees throughout the EU’. In response to the Commission's invitation, EBIC has committed to drafting self-regulatory principles on transparency and comparability of personal current account fees. Consumer representatives at EU level are consulted on this process and the European Commission is kept informed on a regular basis. EBIC provided the Commission with the draft final self-regulatory principles on 12 September and these principles are currently being evaluated in view of the meeting with the industry which is supposed to take place in October. However, should this process fail to deliver satisfactory results, , the European Commission has already informed the industry of its readiness to launch the necessary preparations for regulating through legislation the transparency of bank fees.
