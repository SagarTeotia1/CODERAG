WRITTEN QUESTION E-5742/08 by Stavros Lambrinidis (PSE) to the Commission (22 October 2008) Subject: Visa Waiver Programme — refusal to grant Greece exemption According to current reports in the Greek press, the visa requirement for Greek nationals visiting the USA will not be waived, as it has been for all the ‘old’ Member States of the EU, since an exemption has been vetoed by the White House National Security Council for ‘political reasons’ relating to terrorism. In the light of that decision, it should be borne in mind that, since 2005, a reciprocity mechanism may be activated at Community level following a notification from a Member State, contacts by the Commission with the third country concerned and a Commission report to the Council, which could then decide on ‘a temporary restoration of the visa requirement for nationals of the third country in question’. Moreover, Community competence in visa matters (which the USA also recognised at the JHA Ministerial Troika on 13 March 2008) includes the conditions on which visa-free status is given to third countries and such conditions must ensure equal treatment for all EU citizens, not only as regards the granting or denial of visa-free status per se, but also as regards the terms and conditions under which such status is given to different EU Member States by third countries. 1. Will the Commission, therefore, say whether the Greek Government has informed it of the progress of the problematic negotiations with the USA on waiving the visa requirement, the further postponement of incorporating Greece into the scheme, and the reasons for the USA's decision, in order to activate the reciprocity mechanism? 2. What measures will the Commission take to put an end to the unequal treatment of Greek citizens, whilst ensuring that no third country is allowed to exert pressure on a Member State of the EU to pass on sensitive personal data concerning its citizens in breach of European and its national legislation?
