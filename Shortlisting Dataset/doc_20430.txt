WRITTEN QUESTION E-4722/06 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (31 October 2006) Subject: Lisbon Agenda A recent poll of 1000 business chief executives surveyed by ICM revealed the following: 1. 52 % of chief executives think that the EU is ‘failing’; 2. 54 % of chief executives think EU over-regulation ‘outweighs’ the benefit of the single market; 3. 59 % of chief executives think that the burden of EU regulation is increasing. These figures clearly demonstrate that businesses do not believe that the Lisbon Agenda ‘to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy in the world’ is succeeding. With these facts in mind, does the Commission also believe that the Lisbon Agenda is failing? And does the Commission agree with the 59 % of chief executives who believe that the burden of EU regulation is increasing?
