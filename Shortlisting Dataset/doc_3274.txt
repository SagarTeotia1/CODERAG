Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (3 March 2011) 1. The Commission is aware that various sectors of the economy and transport modes calculate the external costs of their activities differently. 2. The Commission is of the view that it is important to inform consumers and businesses on the external costs that arise as a consequence their choices. 3. The Commission has commissioned a study in 2008 that resulted in the publication of the Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector Maibach et al., Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector, Internalisation, Measures and Policies for All external Cost of Transport (IMPACT), Version 1.1, Delft, CE, 2008 http://ec.europa.eu/transport/sustainable/doc/2008_costs_handbook.pdf . The handbook was jointly prepared by several transport research institutes, and it summarises the state of the art as regards the valuation of external costs. The Commission made use of this handbook to prepare a communication on a strategy to internalise the external costs for all modes of transport COM(2008)435 final. that was adopted in July 2008 and a proposal to revise the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles COM(2008)436 final. . However, the Commission has not considered introducing a kind of quality label, which would certify one particular method of calculation as the correct one. 4. In the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Transport, the Commission is considering initiatives for common EU standards to estimate the environmental footprint of passenger and freight transport.
