WRITTEN QUESTION E-3958/06 by Patrick Louis (IND/DEM) to the Council (21 September 2006) Subject: Religious freedom in the People's Republic of China All observers and human rights organisations are unanimous in their condemnation of systematic violations by the Chinese Government of the freedom of thought and religious freedom of the Chinese people. Christian churches, and the Chinese Roman Catholic Church in particular, are subjected to constant persecution by the authorities, ranging from simple humiliation to imprisonment and torture. In two weeks’ time, a Chinese delegation is to visit the European Parliament. Could the Council outline what it has done and what it intends to do in the field of EU‑China relations, both politically and economically, to defend religious freedom in China?
