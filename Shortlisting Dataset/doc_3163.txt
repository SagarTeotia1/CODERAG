as soon as possible; (b) with that end in view, eliminate the technical obstacles and move towards a single European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) and interoperable solutions; and (c) improve freight and passenger transport services and the quality of service. Civil aviation: although airlines have cut their fuel consumption per passenger-kilometre in the last ten years, the overall environmental impact of civil aviation has risen on account of the substantial expansion in traffic. Therefore, MEPs call for: (a) air transport to be included in the ETS; (b) emissions-based differential take-off and landing charges at airports; (c) the establishment of the'Clean Sky a Joint Technology Initiative' that aims at reducing CO2 and NOx emissions and noise pollution; (d) the creation of a real Single European Sky; (e) practical steps to relieve airport congestion; and (f) the improvement of access to airports by rail. Shipping: given the fact that emissions from shipping are continuing to increase, the report recommends that: (a) CO2, SO2, nitrogen oxide, and other emissions from ships be reduced; (b) the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power be encouraged; (c) vessels that come to anchor be fuelled from land-based sources; (d) the use of emission allowance trading to contain emissions be treated as a possibility deserving careful consideration; (e) an integrated European rivers policy be agreed. Finally, MEPs stress that the transport sector must also meet the EU goals of reducing oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% over 1990 levels by 2020.

The grant will go towards reimbursing part of the cost of emergency measures such as rescue services, cleaning up after flood damage, and restoring basic infrastructure. Unusually heavy rainfall in June and July 2007 caused disastrous floods in several UK regions, resulting in severe damage to infrastructure, businesses and private households. Direct damage is estimated to amount to over €4.6 billion, the third highest total caused by a natural disaster since the EU Solidarity Fund was launched in 2002. This is the first application from the UK for financial assistance after a major natural disaster. The report approving the funding from the EU Solidarity Fund was adopted by 613 votes in favour, 11 against and 17 abstentions. The UK application indicates the regions that were affected by the floods. These are: East Midlands, West Midlands, Yorkshire/Humber, South West England, Wales, Northern Ireland. Projects from all of these regions
