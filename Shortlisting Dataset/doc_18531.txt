Answer given by Mr Cioloș on behalf of the Commission (11 August 2010) The Commission was informed of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development's plans to improve the Land Parcel Identification System. From the information received it appears that a project is to be finalised by November 2011. This means that the maps would be sent to farmers in spring 2012 (and not 2011). Further work to be performed is scheduled so that the overall finalisation is foreseen for November 2013. As regards the approach taken by N-Ireland, in so far as there are no results available yet, the Commission is at this stage not in a position to give an opinion. To guarantee that the work is satisfactory, it is imperative that the project is carried out to the required technical standard and that in the assessment of eligible land there is correct application of the EU rules.
