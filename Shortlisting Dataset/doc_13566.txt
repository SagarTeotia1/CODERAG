Joint answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-3031/08 , E-3174/08 (22 July 2008) In the proposed GSP Regulation for 2009-11, it is proposed that Vietnam be graduated for footwear and other Section XII products. The proposal to graduate Vietnam in Section XII is based on a full statistical analysis which has been objectively and consistently applied to all GSP beneficiaries. The Commission has used the officially available Eurostat database which is the reference in the Commission's calculation. The basic graduation mechanism (Article 13:1 in the new Regulation) states that ‘tariff preferences will be removed… when the average value of Community imports from that country of products included in the section concerned and covered by the arrangement… exceeds 15 % of the value of Community imports of the same products from all beneficiary countries and territories over three consecutive years, on the basis of the most recent data available on 1 September 2007’. The graduation calculation is therefore based on imports covered by GSP excluding those customs tariff numbers (CN) codes to which a most-favoured nation (MFN) zero tariff applies for 1 January of each of the three relevant years. For Vietnam/Section XII, this test is met — with 23.5 % in 2004, 19.1 % in 2005 and 17.1 % in 2006, giving an average over the three years of 19.9 %. The question was therefore whether Vietnam is still covered by Article 13:4 of the new regulation: ‘ Paragraph 1 shall not apply to a beneficiary country in respect of any section which represents more than 50 % in value of all GSP-covered imports into the Community originating from that country’. This is not the case since section XII represented 54.2 % of all GSP-covered imports from Vietnam in 2004, 50.8 % in 2005 and 42.3 % in 2006, which leads to an average over the three year period of 49.1 %. (For reference in 2001-03, the base period for the statistical calculations for the present GSP Regulation in 2006-08, the annual figures were 51.6 %, 54.6 % and 57.1 %, giving an average of 54.5 %. This meant that Vietnam was covered by this provision and the graduation which otherwise would have taken place was not implemented.) The fact that the importance of Section XII has fallen below 50 % over the three year reference period is an indication that other GSP-covered sections are performing increasingly strongly, so that the relative importance of Section XII has declined. This is very clearly illustrated in a side-by-side comparison of EC imports from Vietnam in Section XII and in all GSP-covered products since 2001. EC GSP-Covered Imports (Section XII and Total) from Vietnam, 2001‑06 (EUR million) 2001 2002 2003 avg 2001-03 2004 2005 2006 avg 2004-06 Section XII 1896 2019 2084 2179 2120 2111 Total 3658 3697 3649 4020 4169 4994 % 51.8 54.6 57.1 54.5 54.2 50.8 42.3 49.1 These statistics show that over the period 2001‑06, EC imports under Section XII increased by 11.3 % while the total GSP covered imports increased by 36.5 %.
