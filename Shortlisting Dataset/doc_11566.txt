WRITTEN QUESTION E-5769/09 by Nick Griffin (NI) to the Commission (25 November 2009) Subject: Peak Oil, not man-made climate change, is the real threat to civilisation According to Dr Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the respected International Energy Agency (IEA), the world is heading for a catastrophic energy crisis because most of the world's major oil fields have passed their peak production and the consumption of oil is unsustainable with demand far outstripping supply. Dr Birol has warned that the oil on which modern civilisation depends is running out far faster than previously predicted — a 6.7 % decline rather than 3.7 % — and that global production is likely to peak in about 10 years, a decade earlier than most governments had estimated. Oil companies will be forced to turn to the large reserves of non-conventional oil, such as the tar sands of Canada, but this is dirty oil and refining it will produce vast amounts of carbon dioxide. Will the Commission acknowledge that man-made climate change is a contested scientific theory with no real impact for decades and that Peak Oil is a clear and present danger to the stability of our entire civilisation and — if man-made climate change is real — to all efforts to curb CO 2 emissions?
