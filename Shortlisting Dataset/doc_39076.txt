Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (12 October 2011) The recommendation, adopted by the Council on 28 June 2011, sets out a framework for comprehensive policies to reduce early school leaving and indicates effective and efficient ways to tackle the problem. It invites the Commission to monitor developments at different educational levels across Member States, to facilitate cooperation and exchange of good practice, to support the development of effective policies against early school leaving by launching comparative studies and research, and to support the implementation of Member States strategies by EU funding, e.g. EU Structural Funds. Specific steps taken in 2011 include: — The Commission is in the process of establishing a Thematic Working Group on early school leaving. Member States have been nominating participants, and it is expected that the group will start its work by the end of 2011. — The Commission will organise a conference on policies to reduce early school leaving in March 2012 in order to facilitate the exchange of good practice. — The Commission has launched a call for tenders for an EU‑wide study on making use of good practices from second-chance education to reduce early school leaving. Greece is invited to participate in the Thematic Working Group and to profit from the exchange of experiences under the Open Method of Coordination.
