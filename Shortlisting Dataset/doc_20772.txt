WRITTEN QUESTION E-4574/08 by Jim Higgins (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (11 August 2008) Subject: More priority to be given to EU social objectives Will the Commission pursue a more balanced approach between the social, environmental and economic objectives of the EU? While focus on competitiveness, energy and climate change is warranted, it should not come at the expense of serious issues affecting people's daily lives, such as the downgrading of social protection systems, the reorganisation of public services, etc. How does the Commission propose to redress this imbalance?
