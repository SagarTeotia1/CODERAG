from Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time OJ L 299, 18.11.2003, p. 9. until 31 December 2005, a deadline subsequently extended to 31 December 2006 by a decision of the German Bundesrat ; expresses its surprise at this state of affairs and emphasises that the Commission must examine the German legislation and all collective agreements containing exemptions to working time legislation in order to assess whether Directive 2003/88/EC is being implemented thereby; 6. Notes that the instant case is one example of the systematic failure and difficulties encountered by various Member States in complying with the basic provisions of Directive 2003/88/EC, as can be seen from the Extended Impact Assessment ( SEC(2004)1154 ) which the Commission produced before embarking on the planned review of Directive 2003/88/EC; reminds the Commission that further complaints have been addressed to the Ombudsman regarding the failure of other Member States to comply with Directive 2003/88/EC; 7. Also urges all the Member States, in the light of the foregoing, to apply faithfully all the rules relating to health and safety at work on the basis of the principle that, in event of any doubt, the interpretation of the law which is most favourable to the health and safety of workers should prevail ( in dubio pro operario ).
