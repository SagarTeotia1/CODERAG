that the best treatment options, such as those based on mitigating climate change, are followed; further encourages support for environmentally friendly forms of waste management and measures to render more severe the consequences of land-filling of waste, which pollutes the environment; 15. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take all appropriate action in order to ensure that natural resources are used rationally and efficiently and in a way which does not jeopardise biodiversity; Implementation and enforcement of existing legislation 16. Recalls that full and correct implementation of the existing legislation is a top priority and considers that binding legislation remains central to meeting environmental challenges; calls on the Commission to strengthen its activities as guardian of the Treaty; therefore also calls on the EU budgetary authority to provide the Commission with all the necessary financial and human resources to ensure that the most efficient monitoring of the implementation and enforcement of existing legislation is carried out in all Member States; 17. Emphasises the need for effective and accurate implementation of Community environmental legislation and recommends that special support measures be adopted for the benefit of regions which face difficulties in implementing that aspect of the Community acquis ; encourages Member State authorities to draw up transposition strategies in order to define clearly the roles and responsibilities of national, regional and local authorities in correctly transposing and implementing Community environmental law; 18. Is nonetheless concerned at the various proponents' suggestions that common regulations should be reduced and weakened, or even replaced with voluntary agreements or other non-binding measures; therefore reiterates that better regulation should concentrate on unambiguous and transparent rules and standards based on legislation linked to agreed objectives, and on better enforcement thereof; 19. Commends the Commission's proposals to strengthen enforcement of environmental legislation at the national level through improved access to justice and harmonised use of punitive law; notes that the preventive aspects of punitive law contribute to better enforcement and protection of the environment; 20. Calls, furthermore, for EU environmental policies to be designed, and reviewed, so as to focus more on goal prescriptions rather than means descriptions, leaving Member States and farmers free to find the most effective and efficient means for reaching the desired goals; Nature, biodiversity and climate change 21. Considers that the Commission should ensure full implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives; recommends, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, that taxation measures be taken to promote best practice and deter people from engaging in activities that generate pollution; 22. Draws the Commission's attention, however, to the fact that holding out the prospect of consequences under criminal law is not sufficient in every case to prevent illegal and at the same time environmentally polluting behaviour; stresses therefore the importance of penalties after the fact under criminal law, particularly for the illegal dumping of hazardous waste in the territory of other countries; Environment incentives and reform of environmentally harmful subsidies 23. Welcomes the Commission's green paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes; believes that wider use of market-based instruments,
