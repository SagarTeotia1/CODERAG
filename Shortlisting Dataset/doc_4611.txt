time it allows the manufacturer to provide the missing data and, in the future, to put its product on the market if compliance with Council Directive 93/42/EEC is demonstrated. This possibility would have been excluded in the case where the Commission would have considered the national measure justified in the framework of a safeguard clause. 2. The procedure in 1997 has not been further pursued, and no hearing of the manufacturer took place, because according to the information of the Commission the manufacturer at the time did not continue to place the device on the market. To the Commission's knowledge the device was only placed on the market again end 2002/beginning 2003. 3. The Landesamt für Arbeitsschutz Sachsen-Anhalt declared on 12 December 1996 that it identified no concerns in relation to the Inhaler Broncho-Air. However, this authority later prohibited the placing on the market of the Inhaler Broncho-Air with effect of 23 September 1997 and thus obviously has taken a different viewpoint. Given that the procedure was not pursued at the time for the reasons explained above, what led the authorities in Sachsen-Anhalt to change their point of view was not investigated either. 4. The Commission has expressly requested the German authorities to support the manufacturer in identifying missing data. According to the draft protocol of the meeting between the manufacturer and the German authorities in August 2007, the German authorities offered to this end a scientific exchange or to provide an expert opinion. To the Commission's information the manufacturer has not yet made use of this offer. The Commission will follow this case closely, as it has done over 2006. It will be in contact with the German authorities to follow-up the further steps and to ensure, if necessary, the respect of Community law.
