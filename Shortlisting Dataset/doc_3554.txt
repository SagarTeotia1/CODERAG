The Council agreed to the text of a draft decision on the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH). At present, the Community enjoys only observer status in the HCCH. Full membership is necessary for two reasons. It would: - grant the Community a status consistent with its new role as a major international player in the field of civil judicial cooperation; - enable the Community to fully participate in the negotiation of conventions in areas of its competence by expressing its views and positions and ensuring consistency and coherence between its own rules and envisaged international instruments. Moreover, the Community as such rather than its Member States would be the subject of the rights and obligations stemming from Hague Conventions in areas of its competence. The HCCH is a long-established international organisation with the objective of ensuring the progressive unification of the rules of private international law, mainly by negotiating and drafting international conventions.

MEPs will debate and vote on a deal reached on 2 May in the Conciliation Committee which means a new EU directive will ensure that such schemes are set up throughout Europe by 2008. The aim: to protect nature and rubbish dumps from the often toxic substances contained in the tonnes of batteries discarded annually. In future used batteries will have to be collected and recycled. " This is the sixth piece of legislation we have agreed under conciliation in this parliamentary term ", said Dagmar ROTH-BEHRENDT (PES, DE), who led the European Parliament delegation. " Once more Parliament has managed to improve the draft legislation a great deal. There was a constructive spirit of negotiation on both sides, in the Parliament and the Council.
