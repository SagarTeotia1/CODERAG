Council to refrain from taking further decisions on this questions until an agreement is reached with the European Parliament, in accordance with the IIA and the guidelines already identified by the European Parliament; 25. Recalls that the IIA recognises all expenditure on Special Envoys as operational expenditure to be included the Commission section of the general budget; warns that any move to include operational expenditure in the Council budget would be contrary to paragraph 39 of the IIA and Article 19 of the Financial Regulation and, moreover, would be an extremely serious threat to the institutional balance of the Treaty; notes furthermore that such a decision would call into question Article 274 of the EC Treaty, which confers on the Commission responsibility for implementing operational expenditure, and Article 276, which gives Parliament powers of censure and discharge; accordingly opposes the Council's proposal to finance the Special Envoys in future in its section of the budget; 26. Calls on the EU institutions to monitor closely the Peace and Reconstruction Process in East Timor, by sending a Special Envoy to this area; 27. Insists on the need to clarify the administrative costs of the CFSP before Council's first reading and in accordance with the principle of Activity Based Budgeting (ABB); 28. Calls on the Council to make a formal declaration confirming its willingness to implement paragraph 40 of the IIA, in particular as regards transmitting to the European Parliament immediately after it adopts a decision and in each case an estimate of the costs envisaged (financial statements) including the elements referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 40, when transmitting such information, the Council should indicate, whenever necessary, that the confidential procedure will apply; 29. Welcomes the continuing trend to transfer CFSP actions from the second pillar (B8 in the budget) to the Community pillar (B7); regrets, however, that this trend considerably reduces the amount available under heading 4 for traditional external actions while the annual amount available for CFSP remains constant; 30. Considers that the proposed Rapid Reaction Facility represents a new Community action previously included under CFSP for which no provision was made under the financial perspective; regrets that this is being done at the expense of traditional external actions of major significance to the European Union; 31. Notes the plans of the Member State governments to develop a European security and defence policy (ESDP); is concerned, however, about the consequences which this will have for the rest of the budget and for the financial perspective (headings 4 and 5); demands that the Council and the Commission present a thorough evaluation of the expenditure required for this new policy up until 2006 and proposals on how it will be financed; 32. Believes that preparatory measures ( B8-0151 ) should include a feasibility study, based on the experience gained and models developed when Economic and Monetary Union was established, with a view to the introduction of a European foreign and security policy; On other aspects of the Preliminary Draft Budget 33. Follows with interest the internal discussions over externalisation; reminds the Commission
