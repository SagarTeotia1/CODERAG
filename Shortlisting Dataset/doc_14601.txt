Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (11 October 2011) The Commission is aware of the entry into force of the law providing for legalisation of certain properties that were built without prior authorisation. The Commission requested detailed information on the implementation process from the national authorities in the framework of the joint Special Group of Public Administration Reform, a body of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. On a general note, the respect of the rule of law principle is at the core of EU values. The Commission constantly monitors the candidate countries' continuing fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria. The next Progress Report outlining the Commission's findings will be published in October 2011.
