a result of the Community strategy for endocrine disrupters, the Commission took early actions to tackle this issue by funding a number of research projects on endocrine disrupters, with the total amount reaching approximately EUR 145 million today. These projects are presented at http://ec.europa.eu/research/endocrine/index_en.html. Among several projects studying health impacts of flame retardants, a particular project called FIRE (www.rivm.nl/fire), to end in November 2006, has been studying the impacts of a large number of flame retardants on both wild life and humans, and a risk assessment report will be available later in 2006. A recent publication 'Commission research in action: Tackling the hormone disrupting chemicals issues', describing first results from research projects funded in recent years, is available from tuomo.karjalainen@ec.europa.eu.
