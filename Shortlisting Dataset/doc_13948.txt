Answer given by Mr Figel’ on behalf of the Commission (5 October 2005) The Commission uses, on occasion and for various reasons, its right to terminate the contracts it has concluded with translation agencies. Regarding possible complaints of freelance translators about agencies employing them and working for the Commission, it has to be recalled that the Commission cannot under any circumstances be regarded as the translation agency’s employer nor consequently assume any obligation incumbent on an employer as regards civil, tax or other matters. Such obligations are the sole responsibility of the translation agency. However, in concluding the contract with the Commission, the translation agencies undertake to comply with their professional obligations under national law. On the basis of the criteria defined in the Financial Regulation Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, OJ L 248, 16.9.2002 . , the Commission excludes tenderers from the participation in a procurement procedure notably if they have been convicted of an offence concerning their professional conduct by a judgment which has the force of res judicata , if they have been guilty of grave professional misconduct or if they have not fulfilled obligations relating to the payment of social security contributions.
