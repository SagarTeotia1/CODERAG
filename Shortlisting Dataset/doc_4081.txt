Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (28 January 2011) On 30 September 2010, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the US Department of the Treasury, published in the Federal Register a Notice of proposed rulemaking that would require certain depository institutions and money services businesses (MSBs) to affirmatively provide records to FinCEN of certain cross-border electronic transmittals of funds (CBETF). This Notice is a necessary preparatory step within the official rulemaking procedure in the US. Before a rule becomes final and before it can be applied and enforced, the public and any interested party have the opportunity to comment on the proposed rulemaking. In this case, the proposal was open for comments on any and all aspects of the proposals until 29 December 2010. After such consultation procedure has elapsed and the comments have been considered the proposed rulemaking can be adopted. This could be considered a public consultation and, for these reasons, the Commission believes that replies to the Honourable Member's questions should be given on the basis of the Final Rule as any aspects of the proposed system might be changed after this consultation stage. The Commission has regular contacts with its US counterparts through various channels including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Money Laundering, of which both the European Commission and the United States are members. The Commission will consider any opportunity to discuss the proposed rulemaking both at the consultation stage and during the run up to the new legislation.
