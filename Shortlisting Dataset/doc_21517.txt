Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (20 June 2011) The matter to which the Honourable Member refers was brought to the Commission's attention by an interested party in April 2009, whom the Commission services met informally in September 2009. No formal complaint has been received by the Commission since. In order for a measure to constitute state aid the following four conditions must be fulfilled cumulatively: (1) there must be a transfer of state resources; (2) the measure in question must involve an economic advantage to the recipient; (3) the measure must distort, or threaten to distort, competition; and (4) the measure must affect trade between Member States. On the basis of the information available about the situation of the Jornal da Madeira, the Commission services took the preliminary view that the condition referring to the effect on intra-EU trade did not seem to be met. If an effect on trade between Member States cannot be demonstrated, the Commission is not competent to assess whether a measure is compatible with the internal market under the state aid rules.
