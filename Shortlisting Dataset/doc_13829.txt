that a reserve of EUR 35 million was entered in the 2003 budget earmarked for the purchase of the Konrad Adenauer Building in Luxembourg; regrets, however, that the negotiations with the Luxembourg authorities have not been as successful as expected; invites the Luxembourg authorities not to forget their commitment given to Parliament to take previous lease payments into account; invites its Bureau to examine what other options could be available on the real estate market, should the negotiations with Luxembourg produce no satisfactory results; points out that the budgetary authority will not be willing to cover the financing for the unreasonable prices now being proposed; 39. Notes that the legal situation concerning the Louise Weiss building in Strasbourg and its final price may be clarified in the course of 2003; recalls that advance payments were made on the building in 2000 and 2002, in line with Parliament's wish to reduce the financing time frame as much as possible; takes the view that further advance payments make sense from a budgetary point of view, irrespective of the option to purchase, in order to create leeway in future budgets; 40.

Recalls that the cost of the Court's building project to cater for enlargement, namely the renovation and extension of the palace building and the construction of two new towers, was estimated to amount to EUR 296 million; urges the Court, despite the fact that the financing of this project will not have an impact on the 2004 budget, to ensure that the square metre price is reduced, with a view to providing best value for money, or to examine alternative proposals; 43. Requests the Court to fine-tune its enlargement-related staffing estimations with a view to presenting a realistic request in its 2004 estimates; reiterates its position that the backlog in translations is not considered to be a permanent problem and recalls that appropriations for the creation of 51 linguistic posts were made available by the budgetary authority to solve the problem; expects the Court to inform the budgetary authority on the
