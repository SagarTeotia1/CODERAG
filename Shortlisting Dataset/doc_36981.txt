Question for written answer E-007717/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE) (9 August 2011) Subject: Labour costs in Greece and the approach to investments According to the Commission's fourth review on the Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2011/pdf/ocp82_en.pdf ‘a further substantial reduction in unit labour costs will be necessary to perceptibly improve competitiveness.’ Moreover, according to Eurostat data http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-20062011-AP/EN/3-20062011-AP-EN.PDF , for the first quarter of 2011, Greece reported the greatest reduction in hourly labour cost — amounting to 6.8 % —, compared to 2.7 % for the EU, while a recent study http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/28/25/47930053.pdf by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reports that Greek employees work 2119 hours per year, far more than recorded in most OECD countries, where average working hours are 1 739 hours. However, Greece is ranked 119th out of a total of 141 countries in terms of attracting FDI, improving its attractiveness by only two places in the period 2008‑10, according to data published in a report http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/wir2010_en.pdf by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. In view of all the above, will the Commission say: — How does it evaluate all the above findings and conclusions? — What is meant by a reduction in labour costs? What cuts are involved here? — How does it view the fact that, despite wage reductions in 2010, Greece has hardly improved its ability to attract new investments? — What factors does it consider responsible for the competitiveness deficit? The lack of skills and low productivity of Greek workers, high non-wage labour costs, the lack of fiscal and other incentives, or the lack of an appropriate infrastructure and institutional framework?
