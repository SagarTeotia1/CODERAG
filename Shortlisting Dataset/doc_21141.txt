WRITTEN QUESTION E-1879/04 by Nirj Deva (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 September 2004) Subject: Human rights in the Maldives Is the Commission aware of reports on the Maldives drawn up by groups such as Amnesty International, which expose government corruption and fundamental flaws in the new Constitution, as well as in the parliamentary, executive and judicial systems? If so, how does the Commission justify allocating EUR 2 million in development assistance aid (2003-2006) to the Maldives when its government is, in essence, a corrupt and repressive regime that flouts the fundamental guidelines established in the UN Charter of Human Rights which require each citizen to be treated with respect and dignity? Is the Commission aware of the ability of the Maldives Parliament to render ineffective fundamental guarantees of human rights enshrined in its particularly vague 1997 Constitution by passing new government legislation? And is it aware that the Government of the Maldives refers to its Constitution as a guarantor of fundamental human rights? Is the Commission aware of the suppression of the Maldivian Democratic Party, an independent party with a peaceful political programme, which was initially banned and whose supporters have been subjected to arrest and harassment? How does the Commission view the recent arrest of 180 people following pro-democracy demonstrations earlier in August? Can the Commission ensure freedom of speech for the citizens of the Maldives, especially in view of the repression of the press and the increasing imprisonment of known writers and publishers who have been critical of the Maldives Government?
