Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (4 November 2011) The safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has already been addressed by European Union (EU) action recently. In particular, Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom of 19 July 2011 OJ L 199, 2.8.2011. establishes a Community framework for the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. It applies to all stages of spent fuel and radioactive waste management, including treatment and conditioning of radioactive waste. Member States must bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive by 23 August 2013.
