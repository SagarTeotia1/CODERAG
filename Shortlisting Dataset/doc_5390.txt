For each category, the above requirements shall be postponed by two years in respect of engines with a production date prior to the said date. The permission granted for one stage of emission limit values shall be terminated with effect from the mandatory implementation of the next stage of limit values." The permission granted for one stage of emission limit values shall be terminated with effect from the mandatory implementation of the next stage of limit values." Justification Inclusion of rail vehicles (R1 below 560 kW, R2 above 560 kW) in both stages and the introduction of a second stage for inland waterway vessels for NOx reduction. There is still great potential for reducing emissions in inland shipping which must definitely be exploited on environmental grounds! In the Netherlands, for example, inland waterway vessels are responsible for up to 40% of total NOx emissions. The SCR technology, which makes this possible, is already available and will be used from 2008 for HGVs and is already in use on Swedish Baltic ferries. Amendment 19 ARTICLE 1, POINT 6(ca) (new) Article 9, paragraph 4a (new) (Directive 97/68/EC) (ca) a new paragraph 4a is added: "4a. LABELLING TO INDICATE EARLY COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF EURO STAGES III AND IV For engine types which comply with Euro Stage III and IV limit values before the dates referred to in the section concerning type approval, Member States shall allow special labelling to indicate such early compliance." Justification Where future limit values are complied with ahead of time, manufacturers should be able to indicate as much on their products and use it for advertising purposes. Labelling of this kind will also enable consumers to make a more informed decision when purchasing a product. Amendment 20 ARTICLE 1, POINT 6a (new) Article 9a (new) (Directive 97/68/EC) (6a) A new Article 9a is inserted as follows: "Article 9a The use of defeat devices or irrational emission control strategies shall be prohibited."
