Question for written answer E-011444/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nicole Sinclaire (NI) (5 December 2011) Subject: VP/HR — EU aid to Palestine From 1994 to the end of 2009, the European Union committed approximately EUR 4.26 billion in assistance to the Palestinians through various instruments. For 2011, EUR 295 million have been allocated to occupied Palestinian territory. Can Vice-President/High Representative Ashton assure me that no EU funding has gone to Hamas, or to any employees of the Palestinian Authority who are members of Hamas? Can she advise me of what checks and measures are in place to ensure that this does not happen now or in the future? Can she advise me of who the competent authority is in respect of this matter?
