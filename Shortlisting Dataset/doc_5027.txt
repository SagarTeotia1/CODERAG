Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (15 May 2007) The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) does not manage any subsidies for border control equipment under the Transition Facility. This Facility was the responsibility of Directorate-General for Enlargement. The Commission has been informed by OLAF that it is not aware of any allegations of fraud relating to border control equipment funded by the Transition Facility. If the Honourable Member is in possession of such information, the Commission invites him to refer it to the Commission or to OLAF. OLAF is responsible, in its capacity as a service of the Commission, for the administration of expenditure financed by the HERCULE programme which is intended to promote the protection of the financial interests of the EC. The investigative units within OLAF have no responsibility for the financial management of these funds and there is thus no incompatibility with OLAF's role as independent investigative body. OLAF is responsible for investigating allegations of fraud, corruption and other serious irregularities committed by staff of all EU bodies, including OLAF itself. It should be noted that OLAF's management structure and procedures allow for the investigation of OLAF's own staff members. Any disciplinary action against OLAF's Director-General would be handled under the special provisions set out in Regulation 1073/1999 OJ L 136, 31.5.1999. . Inquiries into suspected disciplinary or other offences within OLAF may be undertaken by the Investigation and Disciplinary Office of the Commission (IDOC) or the Security Directorate or as follow up to an OLAF investigation.
