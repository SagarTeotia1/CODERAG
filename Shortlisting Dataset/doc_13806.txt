9999/C Q999 E/003 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2643/03 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (25 August 2003) Subject: Sinking of the Danish cargo ship 'Karin Cat' caused by a shift of the cargo 1. On 18 February 2003, the Danish cargo ship Karin Cat , with seven crew members on board, sank in the Mediterranean Sea off the Greek coast. Fortunately, the crew managed to abandon ship before it sank and were picked up by the Malaysian vessel Bunga Pelangi Dua . The Danish Maritime Authority published a report on the accident on 29 July 2003. Is the Commission aware of this report? 2. Cargo was loaded onto the ship at a number of ports. One of these ports was Antwerp, where, among other cargo, two 18-metre loading arms and two smaller, 13-metre loading arms were loaded onto the Karin Cat . The Danish Maritime Authority report states that the securing of the load in the Port of Antwerp was carried out by the crew of the Karin Cat . Can the Commission confirm this? 3. The report goes into the possible causes of the accident in some detail. It states that the shift of the loading arms mentioned above caused a hole in the hull of the Karin Cat , through which so much water poured into the hull that the ship sank. According to the report, the reason for the shift of the cargo was that it had been insufficiently secured to withstand the movement of the vessel during the prevailing rough sea (see the conclusion on page 20 of the report).
