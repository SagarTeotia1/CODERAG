WRITTEN QUESTION E-0138/10 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 January 2010) Subject: Aid for the construction of logistic centres in the Oporto district (Portugal) It is vital to implement the plans to set up logistic centres for the Oporto region (Leixões and Maia/Trofa). However, as far as the latter centre is concerned, the Portuguese Government has announced a further postponement, on account of the high cost of the projected sites, and has not put forward any alternative. Be that as it may, it is essential that this centre be built, given the sharp rise in unemployment in individual municipalities (Trofa — 18 %, Maia — 12 %, and Santo Tirso — 18 %); an alternative site, indeed, is available in the same area, close to the Vilar de Luz airfield. In the light of the foregoing, 1. Does the Commission believe that support could be granted to enable these logistic centres to be built, bearing in mind their importance for regional development? 2. What steps could be taken with a view to setting up a logistic centre in the neighbourhood of Trofa, Maia, and Santo Tirso, bearing in mind that it would do much to stimulate the local economy and reduce the high unemployment rate?
