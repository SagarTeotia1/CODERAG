WRITTEN QUESTION E-2940/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (22 April 2009) Subject: Information on the use of Civitas programme funds by the municipality of Acireale For the Community programming period 2007‑13 numerous financing programmes have been developed; with these programmes the European Union intends to support projects under various sectoral policies. For the municipality of Acireale (Sicily, Italy) it would be important to obtain EU funding for the urban transport sector so as to be able to improve the local transport system and promote the achievement of the general objectives the EU intends to attain at the end of the programming period. With regard to this sector, can the Commission clarify whether the municipality of Acireale has submitted any projects under the Civitas programme? If so, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Acireale has obtained any financing and if it has been used in the correct way and within the proper time frame or whether the subsidies had to be reimbursed?
