in highlighting a number of wide-ranging concerns and complaints against the UK insurance regulators, as well as regulators in other Member States concerned. On this specific issue, oral and written evidence considered by the Committee of Inquiry were submitted by Tom LAKE, John NEWMAN and Paul BRAITHWAITE on behalf of EMAG The Equitable Life Action Group Ltd. (H1, H11, WE2, WE14, WE26, WE28, WE29, WE44, WE58, WE74, WE75, WE76, WE-CONF 22-34); Michael JOSEPHS (H2, WE4, WE31, WE42, WE79), Beatrice and Pat KNOWD (WE4), Nicholas BELLORD (H2), Paul WEIR (H2, WE6); Peter SCAWEN (H3, WE23), Markus WEYER (H3, WE22); Liz KWANTES (H7, WE51); Leslie SEYMOUR (H7, WE36, WE52); Joseph O'BROIN (WE3); Michael NASSIM (WE7, WE8, WE33); John VINALL (WE43); Onagh O'BRIEN (WE-FILE3); Frank TROY (WE-FILE4); K.NOONAN (WE-FILE11); Fred McGUIRK (WE-FILE8); Peter THORNTON (WE-FILE12); Jim BERRY (WE-FILE13); Jack DUGGAN (WE-FILE14); Brian EDMONDS (WE-FILE1); Peter SCHÄFER; Patrick O'FARRELL (WE-FILE9, WE-FILE19); Barry and Susan GROVES (WE-FILE7); Albert DOUGLAS (WE-FILE5); Dermot BYRNE (WE-FILE6); John GALVIN (WE-FILE15); Patrick McCARTHY (WE-FILE16); Roy HARDING (WE-FILE17); David STONEBANKS (WE46); N.F.NORRISH (WE-FILE20); W. DEPPE (WE81); Richard LLOYD (H5); Seamus POWER (WE-FILE2), Simon BAIN (H8, WE72). In their statements they have - to different degrees - accused the UK regulators of failing to exercise properly their regulatory functions in respect of Equitable Life and of negligently failing, over a number of years, to recognize, and to react to, a number of clear warning signs in the prudential supervision of Equitable Life. In H7, Mr. SEYMOUR claimed that "Article 23 of the Third Life Directive requires that the regulator had to supervise and know thoroughly what was happening to an assurance business whose head office was in his territory – I stress both 'in' his territory as well as the business carried out 'outside' that territory. It also states that the supervisor had to “remedy any irregularities prejudicial to the interests of the assured persons”. Representing a policyholders' support group, Ms. KWANTES (H7) claimed that " the UK government was one of the main backers of the Third Life Directive in the early 1990s and were very insistent on robust regulation of the Life Industry. A decade later we are told that the regulation was only 'light touch', whatever that means. In my opinion you either regulate or you don't regulate, there is no half-way house." In WE7 Mr. NASSIM claimed that " the regulators spent over-much time debating the circumstances under which they might use their discretionary powers and in the event never used them when the overall situation required them to do so. As a result they did not recognise or react to any of the important successive stages in the development of that position." In H8 Mr. BAIN claimed that " lack of supervision allowed Equitable Life to believe it could do whatever it liked, because it was operating in a regulation-free zone." Referring to Equitable Life's communication culture, which should have allowed an attentive Regulator to eventually spot its potential financial weaknesses, a memorandum supplied to the House of Commons Treasury Committee in January 2001 see WE58 for more details.
