law as well as an essential regulatory tool; whereas conditions concerning industrial relations must be respected and traditions of industrial relations and level of trade union membership vary in the Member States; whereas Member States should promote social dialogue between social partners at all levels because this can be an effective means of helping to achieve appropriate reforms in labour law, R. Whereas action at European Union level must respect Member States' competence in the field of labour law and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, at the same time the European Parliament expects the Commission to propose legislative initiatives when this is necessary to underpin a system of minimum social standards applicable throughout the Union, on the basis of the Community acquis,S. whereas in order to meet the current economic challenges the European Union must do its utmost to ensure the stability of the Member States’ labour markets, respond to the large-scale redundancies in certain sectors and provide its citizens with a higher level of health and safety in the workplace than before, which is essential for maintaining living conditions in harmony with human dignity and fundamental European values, 1. Welcomes a new approach to labour law that aims to cover all workers regardless of their contractual situation; 2. Welcomes discussions on the need to improve labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century, in particular the need to reduce the insecurity sometimes associated with non-standard forms of employment, and to enhance the protection of vulnerable workers, in order to create more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, thereby helping to achieve the goals of the Lisbon Strategy; considers that improving labour law should be consistent with the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with particular reference to Title IV, and must respect and safeguard the values of the European social model and established social rights; 3. Notes with great concern that the Commission's Green Paper, while recognising that the current labour market conditions create gender inequality, for example in terms of the gender pay gap and occupational and sectoral segregation, totally ignores the obligations and responsibilities under the Commission comunication entitled 'A Roadmap for equality between women and men' ( COM(2006)0092 ); 4. Notes, again with great concern, that the Green Paper, although recognising that women face an imbalance between their professional and private lives, ignores the urgent need for action in order to reconcile professional and private life with demographic challenges, which complies with the European Pact for Gender Equality and the Commission’s Communication on the demographic future of Europe ( COM(2006)0571 ); 5. Considers that the priorities for labour law reform are: (a) extending protection to workers in atypical forms of employment; (b) clarifying the situation of dependent employment and the grey areas between self-employment and employees with a dependent employment relationship; (c) taking action against undeclared work; and (d) facilitating the transition between various situations of employment and unemployment; 6. Underlines that the European economy needs more people in employment in order to be able to compete globally and to fulfil the promises
