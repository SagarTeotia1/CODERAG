Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (26 October 2007) Directive 2004/38/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States OJ L 158, 30.4.2004. does not prevent Member States from requiring that EU citizens residing in its territory acquire a unique administrative identification number. Spanish legislation obliges all foreigners residing in Spain to obtain such a number (Número de Identidad de Extranjero) by means of Royal Decree 2394/2004 Royal Decree 2393/2000, of 30 December, which approves Regulation of the Organic Law 4/2000, of 11 January, on the rights and liberties of foreigners residing in Spain and on their social integration. . The Commission is aware of the delays EU citizens and their family members encounter in Spain when trying to register and obtain registration certificates. The organisation of national administrative authorities is a matter for the Member States alone. They must take all the necessary measures to discharge their obligations under Community law.
