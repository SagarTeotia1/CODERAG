Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (13 December 2005) In its role as guardian of the EC Treaty, the Commission does not hesitate to take all appropriate measures to ensure correct application of Community legislation on waste in the Member States. The Commission has started several infringement procedures against Spain because of the presence of illegal landfills. In the case mentioned by the Honourable Member, it appears from media reports that the closure of the illegal landfill has already started and that a transfer station and a separate collection point are being built to receive the waste generated in the area. Thus, the Spanish authorities seem to be taking the necessary measures to comply with Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste.
