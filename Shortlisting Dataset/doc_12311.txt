WRITTEN QUESTION E-2635/04 by Marie-Arlette Carlotti (PSE) to the Commission (26 October 2004) Subject: Development funding: EU proposals on international taxes The Millennium Development Goals will not be met owing to a lack of funds. In the search for funds, the idea of using international taxes to fund development aid is gaining ground. The World Bank is currently studying arrangements of this kind. Several large countries have said that they are in favour of such a move and the G8 itself is likely to place the matter on the agenda for its next meeting. A number of arrangements are currently being subjected to in-depth, costed assessments and would appear to be both realistic and economically sound, namely: — a tax on international financial transactions or securities transactions (a proposal best known under the name ‘Tobin tax’), — a tax on carbon-dioxide emissions, — a tax on arms sales, — a tax on profits of multinational companies, — a special tax on the world's largest fortunes. However, such proposals can be meaningful only at world or regional level, which is why the EU should push for arrangements of this kind to be put into effect. Is the Commission contemplating drawing up practical proposals with a view to the forthcoming UN Millennium Summit in 2005?
