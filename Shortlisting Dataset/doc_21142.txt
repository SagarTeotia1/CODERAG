EXPLANATORY STATEMENT To date, disputes arising from the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements relied solely on diplomatic approaches for a resolution. In practice, this is not efficient and has led to situations were disputes remained unresolved, as they could easily be blocked by the "injuring" party. The Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with its partners from the Mediterranean in 2006 with a view to negotiate a proper Dispute Settlement Mechanism. A draft agreement was initialled with Egypt at the EU-Egypt Association Council held in Luxembourg on 27 April 2010. The creation of a standard dispute settlement mechanism is welcomed, as it should provide streamlined and effective redress procedures within firm time
