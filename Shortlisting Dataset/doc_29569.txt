WRITTEN QUESTION E-3122/05 by Simon Busuttil (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 September 2005) Subject: Satellite television broadcasts I am informed that SES Astra, the satellite operator, has a licence which requires it to transmit on a pan-European basis. However, it appears that this condition is not being fulfilled. As a result, many EU citizens currently living in EU countries other than their own are not able to receive free-to-air satellite transmissions from their new EU country of residence. Moreover, the lack of satellite coverage means that EU citizens from one EU country are not able to receive and view free-to-air programming transmitted from another. In other cases, although coverage is available, EU citizens living just across the border from their own country are not allowed to subscribe to satellite television programming because the service is not offered in other countries. What is the Commission's position on this matter?
