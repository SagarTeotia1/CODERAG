WRITTEN QUESTION E-2786/04 by Koenraad Dillen (NI) to the Commission (5 November 2004) Subject: Human rights in Turkey On 6 October 2004, the European Commission concluded in both its ‘2004 progress report’ on Turkey and its ‘recommendation’ to the Council and the European Parliament that there were no longer any fundamental problems in Turkey in the area of human and minority rights. However, the chairman of the German parliamentary committee for EU affairs, Mr Matthias Wissman (CDU), stated in the newspaper Die Welt of 20 October 2004 that accession negotiations with Turkey could not be launched while asylum-seekers from Turkey were being recognised in Germany as refugees from political, ethnic or religious persecution in Turkey. A disproportionately high number of applications for asylum in Germany are being made by Turkish people. In 2003, there were over 6300 applications for asylum from Turkey. In 2004, according to the German Ministry of the Interior, 4853 applications for asylum had been made by the end of August. The number of people recognised as refugees is also very high. Again according to the German Ministry of the Interior, 313 people were recognised as refugees between January and August 2004. Mr Wissman rightly points out the inherent contradiction in the European Commission’s decision. How does the European Commission interpret the statistics of the German Ministry of the Interior? Is not the fact that 313 people from Turkey were recognised as refugees between January and August 2004 a damning indictment of the Commission’s conclusion? Do not these figures provide the clearest possible evidence that the Commission’s decision of 6 October 2004 was a purely political one and completely at odds with genuine respect for human and minority rights?
