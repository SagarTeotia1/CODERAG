WRITTEN QUESTION E-4083/07 by David Hammerstein (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (3 August 2007) Subject: Playa Blanca — Fuerteventura Construction work funded by the ERDF on the island of Fuerteventura — at Playa Blanca — has caused damage to natural habitat classified as being of priority importance by the Habitat Directive. The project, drawn up by the firm GESPLAN, was designed to ‘regenerate Playa Blanca’, to which end there were five hectares of amaranthaceae (Traganum moquini), which were included as Priority Habitat 2130, were literally destroyed stable coastal dunes with grassy vegetation included within the Habitat Directive's cartography drawn up by the Ministry of the Environment and Territorial Policy for Europe. Furthermore, the work done has hastened the loss of sand from the beach by increased wind erosion, which has necessitated the inclusion of dry strips of vegetation to halt the sand loss. Is the Commission aware that ERDF funds were used in Playa Blanca to destroy a Habitat Directive priority habitat? What steps does the Commission intend to take in this case?
