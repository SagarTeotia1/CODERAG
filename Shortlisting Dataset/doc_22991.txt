Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (7 April 2010) The Commission is aware of the situation described by the Honourable Member because it is object of the Petition 0543/2009, on which the Parliament has consulted the Commission and the Commission has provided pertinent information. However, the facts are slightly different from the description given by the Honourable Member. Only one of the baby girls has been adopted by the Polish wife of the petitioner (M., born on 29 February 2008). The petitioner himself (a Dutch citizen) claims to be her biological father. The amended birth certificate of M. shows from December 2008 the petitioner and his wife as her parents. The Netherlands has not recognised the adoption decision taken in Poland, even if the legality of this adoption has been explicitly confirmed by the Polish Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs of 29 April 2009 addressed to the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands. From the outset, the Commission would like to point out that there is no European Union legislation on adoption. Decisions on adoption, measures preparatory to adoption and the annulment or revocation of adoption are expressly excluded from the scope of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000, OJ L 338, 23.12.2003. . It is, therefore, incumbent on individual Member States to safeguard the interest of all parties concerned in this important area of family law. Moreover, there is no specific EU legislation regarding recognition of adoption decisions between Member States. This issue is often regulated on a bilateral basis as a consequence, the Commission cannot intervene in this matter. The case of the other child, (O., born on 11 January 2008) is different. She has not been adopted. Here, too, the petitioner claims to be her biological father. The Polish wife of the petitioner has no parental tie with O. The case of O. concerns the recognition in the Netherland of the Polish custody agreement. The petitioner has brought the child to the Netherlands with the consent of the biological mother. The Polish Ministry of Employment and Social affairs with letter of 29 April 2009 addressed to the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands has confirmed the legality of the document concerning the custody of O., verified by a public notary. It seems that the agreement between the father and the biological mother in Poland concerning O. could have been recognised in the Netherlands on the basis of the document drafted pursuant to Polish law, under Article 46 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 of 29 May 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both
