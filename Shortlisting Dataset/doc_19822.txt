Reply (21 June 2005) The European Union is firmly committed to combating all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and anti-Semitism, both within the EU and internationally. Following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, a package of measures has been put into place to combat discrimination, comprising, inter alia, various directives and a Community Action Programme to combat discrimination. This programme also affects the Roma and is aimed at improving the understanding of issues related to discrimination, developing the capacity to tackle discrimination effectively and promoting the values underlying the fight against discrimination. Another example is the Council Directive 2000/43/EC which lays down a framework for combating discrimination, including both direct and indirect discrimination and harassment, on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, with a view to putting into effect in the Member States the principle of equal treatment. The European Union's Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), based in Vienna, provides additional support. Its research is essential to a proper understanding of the problems of racism and to the formulation of policies and practices to promote equality and fight discrimination. The Commission is to submit a proposal to transform the Centre into a Human Rights Agency, which, once in force, will continue to play an important role in this field. The EU also works actively at the international level to combat racism, xenophobia and related forms of discrimination, in particular in the follow up to the Durban plan of action, and at the UN Commission on Human rights and the UNGA Third Committee.
