Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2008) Set-aside was originally introduced as a supply management measure instrument, in a time where potential grain production exceeded market outlets. The Council decision of 26 September 2007 to remove the obligation to set aside land for the autumn 2007 and spring 2008 sowings was necessary to remedy a particular market situation characterised by high prices levels and very low stocks. The Council Regulation (EC) No 1107/2007 Council Regulation (EC) No 1107/2007 of 26 September 2007 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, as regards set-aside for the year 2008, OJ L 253, 28.9.2007. only removes the requirement for compulsory set-aside, but it does not oblige farmers to cultivate their lands. As farmers tend to put their marginal and poorest lands into set-aside, the Commission estimates the effective return of land into production to be no more than 50 % of the 3.8 million hectares currently under obligatory set-aside in 2008. The Commission is fully aware of the need to mitigate any negative environmental consequence deriving from the abolition of compulsory set-aside. In the context of the impact assessment of the common agricultural policy ‘Health check’ review the Commission is currently carrying out an examination of potential options.
