Reply (23 April 2008) The Council continues to discuss the Draft Directive on Temporary Agency Work. In the light of last December's EPSCO Council, the main issues under discussion concerning this Directive are: — the review of prohibitions and restrictions on temporary agency work (Article 4); and — the period during which temporary workers might be subject to conditions of employment which could be inferior to those enjoyed by permanent workers in the same undertaking (Article 5(4)). The Slovene Presidency is indeed willing to continue the work on this draft directive, but is not in a position to estimate when the Council's common position on this proposal might be agreed.
