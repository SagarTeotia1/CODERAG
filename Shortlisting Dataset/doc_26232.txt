Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2010) The Commission has recognised that, in recent years, Ukraine has enjoyed a high level of political freedom which is a significant legacy of the Orange Revolution. Subsequent to the election of President Yanukovych, the Ukrainian government has managed to achieve a level of stability which has eluded Ukraine’s political establishment in recent years. Nevertheless, the EU has also repeatedly expressed concern at consistent and wide-spread reports of deterioration in respect for fundamental freedoms and democratic principles in Ukraine. Particularly worrying are complaints related to freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and freedom of association. The Commission has followed the case raised by the Honourable Member as part of its ongoing review of domestic developments in Ukraine including respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. For the EU these are fundamental principles that bind its member states together. They are also common values in the EU’s relationship with Ukraine. Consequently the pace and depth of our rapprochement with Ukraine will be determined by full respect for these values. The position of the EU on Ukraine, including as regards respect for human rights and democratic values, was set out most recently at the Parliament on 20 October 2010in the form of a statement delivered by the Member of the Commission responsible for Enlargement and Neighbourhood Policy, also on behalf of the High Representative/Vice‑President Catherine Ashton.
