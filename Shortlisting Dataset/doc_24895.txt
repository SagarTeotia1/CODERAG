Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (22 January 2009) The Commission is with great interest following the work in Sweden and other countries regarding the fight against payments of child pornography on the Internet. The Honourable Member will be interested to know that there are very advanced plans to set up an EU‑level financial coalition against commercial child pornography online. The coalition will bring together all stakeholder groups engaged in the fight against the commercial distribution of images of child sexual abuse on the Internet, in particular law enforcement authorities, non-governmental organisations, banks, credit card companies, Internet service providers and other Internet based private operators. This will facilitate properly coordinated law enforcement operations and other complementary disruptive actions against those profiting from this crime, and will contribute considerably to both the protection of victims, the prosecution of offenders and the confiscation of criminal proceeds. There are no data available to the Commission that shows how many bank accounts related to illegal activities on the Internet there are in European Banks. For the time being such harmonisation does not exist. The future EU financial coalition mentioned above will foster practical arrangements for cooperation between European financial institutions and the national and European law enforcement authorities regarding more specifically payments for online child abuse material.
