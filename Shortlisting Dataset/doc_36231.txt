Question for written answer E-003181/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (31 March 2011) Subject: EU humanitarian aid for the Libyan people Following the recent mission of the Commissioner for international cooperation, humanitarian aid and crisis response, Kristalina Georgieva, and the Hungarian Minister for European Affairs, Enikő Győri, to the Libya-Tunisia border, where a humanitarian crisis has arisen in the wake of the massive influx of refugees from Libya, Commissioner Georgieva has announced that the Commission's humanitarian aid will be stepped up for the Libyan refugees in the areas affected by the emergency. The aid will consist of supplies of food, medicines, blankets and tents, and will, according to the Bulgarian commissioner's statements during her mission, amount to EUR 30 million. Can the Commission provide exact figures for the EU's total humanitarian aid budget for the Libyan refugees, and, more generally, for assistance to the Libyan people from the beginning of the insurrection up to the present moment? Was any kind of humanitarian aid being provided to Libya in the period preceding the uprising of the last few weeks? Can the Commission also specify the exact total humanitarian aid budget for the peoples of the Arab world whose countries have been affected by rebellions of recent weeks?
