Reply (19 September 2011) The stability support to Greece was set up by 14 Member States whose currency is the euro. The nature and the conditions of this instrument are governed by an international agreement among these Member States, which does not fall within the scope of the EU Treaties. The conditions for disbursement are stipulated in the memorandum of understanding attached to the loan agreement between the lenders and Greece. The Council is therefore not in a position to comment or provide information on the conditions of the loan established under the international agreement. On 10 May 2010, the Council adopted a decision addressed to Greece with a view to reinforcing and deepening fiscal surveillance and giving notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary to remedy the situation of excessive deficit OJ L 145, 11.6.2010, p. 6. This decision was subsequently amended by Council Decision 2010/486/EU of 7 September 2010 (OJ L 241, 14.9.2010, p. 12), Council Decision 2011/57/EU of 20 December 2010 (OJ L 26, 29.1.2011, p. 15) and Council Decision 2011/257/EU of 7 March 2011 (OJ L 110, 29.4.2011, p. 26). by 2014 at the latest. These measures coincide with the conditions for disbursement stipulated in the memorandum of understanding. The Commission regularly monitors compliance with the relevant Council decisions. The Treaty does not provide any specific mechanism for withdrawal from the euro. Membership in the EMU is permanent.
