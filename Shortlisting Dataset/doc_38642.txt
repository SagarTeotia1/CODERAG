Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (10 December 2007) According to Council Directive 88/378/EEC Council Directive 88/378/EEC of 3 May 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys, OJ L 187, 16.7.1988. on the safety of toys, toys cannot be placed on the market unless they meet the essential safety requirements as set out in Annex II. Compliance with the essential requirements is presumed in respect of toys bearing the CE mark. The CE mark symbolises the conformity of a product with all applicable rules and is the visible signal that all these rules have been complied with and that the conformity assessment procedure has been successfully completed. By its affixing, the manufacturer assumes the responsibility for the compliance of his product. At the present stage, after a widespread consultation that involved the national authorities, industry, consumers, the standardisation and notified bodies and all other relevant stake-holders, as well as the general public, the Commission is preparing a draft proposal for the revision of Council Directive 88/378/EEC. The revision is meant to update the current provisions and to complete them in line with the experience made over almost two decades, with a view to ensuring a very high level of toy safety throughout the European Union. Following the results of the consultation process and the Commission's in-depth assessments, the introduction of a mandatory third party certification does not seem the most appropriate solution to guarantee that a toy is in conformity and safe whilst keeping the burden for toy makers, namely for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), proportionate. However, the final determination of the proposal’s provisions is with the College of Commissioners, to which the file will be submitted in due course.
