Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (23 October 2008) The Commission is closely following developments in this area and requested an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the food safety, animal health, animal welfare and environmental implications of the use of animal clones http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1178620789452.htm . This opinion was delivered in July 2008. The Commission also asked the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) to give an opinion on this matter, published in January 2008 http://ec.europa.eu/european_group_ethics/activities/docs/opinion23_en.pdf . In addition, a Eurobarometer survey has recently been conducted in all 27 Member States on consumers’ attitudes to cloning, on the public’s opinion and awareness of cloning for food production. In the light of these elements, the Commission is currently reflecting on the development of its policy in this area in the framework of legislation on novel foods, zootechnics, animal health and welfare and in the current EU legal framework, and is now proceeding with an analysis of the opinions of EFSA and the EGE and the findings of Eurobarometer before considering any necessary steps to be taken. In this context the Commission will also take into consideration the resolution on the cloning of animals for food supply adopted by Parliament in September 2008. The Commission is not aware of any imports of food products deriving from cloned animals and their offspring to the EU or any trade of such products in the EU.
