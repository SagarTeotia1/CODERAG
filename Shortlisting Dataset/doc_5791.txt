BURMA Following the Burmese army's crackdown on protests against this summer's sharp increase in fuel prices, MEPs - in a resolution adopted by 66 votes to 0 with no abstentions - call on international actors to respond and in particular on EU Member States to press for a binding resolution at the UN. Human rights abuses and poverty remain rife in Burma and, in a further twist, on 15 August the government withdrew fuel subsidies without warning, leading to a 500% increase in fuel prices, doubling transport costs and inflating the cost of essential goods and services. Over 100 human rights activists and peaceful protesters were arrested in the wake of the ensuing protests. Meanwhile, the National Convention of Burma has concluded the drafting of the basic principles for a new Constitution, which the European Parliament says "lacks legitimacy and international credibility due to the absence of democratically elected representatives". Government oppression condemned In their resolution, MEPs voice grave concern not only at the effect of the price increase in basic commodities on Burma's population but also at the military build-up in Rangoon and the violent attacks by security forces and proxy civilian organisations. The resolution deplores the government crackdown, which included violent attacks on civilians, particularly women. It demands "the immediate and unconditional release of all those who have been arrested since the protests began on 19 August 2007", including Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi, and also reiterates its longstanding demand for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The SPDC's "unremitting oppression of the Burmese people and its persistent persecution and imprisonment of pro-democracy activists" are condemned and the EP urges "cessation of the current illegitimate constitutional process, and its replacement by a fully representative National Convention including the NLD and other political parties and groups". Tougher EU sanctions and UN resolution urged MEPs regret that Burmese Foreign Minister Nyan Win, who is banned from travelling to the EU, was permitted to attend the eighth ASEM Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Germany this year, only days after the military junta in Burma had extended the illegal house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi for another year. Thus, while welcoming the renewal of EU targeted sanctions, the resolution argues that they have failed to achieve the desired impact and "calls therefore on the Council to analyse the weaknesses in the present sanctions system and to introduce further measures".
