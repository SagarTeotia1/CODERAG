of action in detail 1) Investigation into alleged contraventions or maladministration in the application of Directive 92/96/EEC by the UK One of the core tasks of the committee was to examine whether Directive 92/96/EEC, the Third Life Directive (3LD) Council Directive 92/96/EEC of 10 November 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance and amending Directives 79/267/EEC and 90/619/EEC (third life assurance Directive), OJ L 311 , 14/11/1997, p.34. , was correctly transposed and properly implemented at the national level in the UK by its competent authorities. The main elements of this line of action are covered in Part II of this report. To do this, the committee was firstly called upon to analyse the overall EU legislative and regulatory framework for the insurance sector and clarify which provisions apply to Equitable Life's situation. In addition to looking at the UK, the committee carried out a comparative analysis, identifying the provisions of national law intended to give effect to the requirements of the Directives, and examined whether these requirements were transposed in a full and timely manner. Secondly, the committee was called upon to examine whether the application of the Directive by the different UK authorities was in conformity with EU legislation. It tried to clarify the respective responsibilities of the various financial authorities involved in the supervision of Equitable Life during the reference period. Detailed investigations were carried out to establish by whom, when and how Equitable Life's solvency, as well as its accounting and provisioning practices, were supervised and how authorities responded to potential weaknesses. As far as the period covered is concerned, the mandate mentions that it should begin with the entry into force of the Third Life Directive (3LD), 1 July 1994, and should end with the events that occurred at Equitable Life, i.e., 1999-2001. Nevertheless, for the purposes of the inquiry, it was necessary to analyze events before 1994, both in terms of the First and Second Life Directives (1LD First Council Directive 79/267/EEC of 5 March 1979 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct life assurance, OJ L 063 , 13/03/1979 P. 0001 - 0018; Second Council Directive 90/619/EEC of 8 November 1990 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance, laying down provisions to facilitate the effective exercise of freedom to provide services and amending Directive 79/267/EEC, OJ L 330 , 29/11/1990 p.50. and 2LD Second Council Directive 90/619/EEC of 8 November 1990 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance, laying down provisions to facilitate the effective exercise of freedom to provide services and amending Directive 79/267/EEC, OJ L 330 , 29/11/1990 p.50. ) as well as the whole adoption process of the 3LD before 1994. 2) Assessment of the UK regulatory regime in respect of Equitable Life The main elements of this line of action are covered in Part IV of the final report.
