Question for written answer E-001336/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Derek Vaughan (S&D) (17 February 2011) Subject: Definition of urban areas within the context of cohesion policy Much emphasis has been placed on the importance of urban areas during the ongoing debate about the future of cohesion funding in the EU, and, with the consultation on the Fifth Cohesion Report now closed, can the Commissioner shed any further light on proposed definitions of urban areas in this context? Can the Commission confirm that this emphasis will not have a detrimental effect on funding for smaller areas of population such as the post-industrial Valleys area of Wales, which currently benefits from structural funding?
