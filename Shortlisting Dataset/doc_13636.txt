Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (21 April 2008) Angel shark (Squatina squatina) found in the Northeast Atlantic spreads from southern Norway, Sweden and the Shetland Islands to Morocco and West Sahara, including the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean. Although this shark is the subject of a small commercial fishery, usually as by-catch, it is in a critical state and it is included in the IUCN (the International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list of threatened species. Some other shark species have shown a significant decline and have been identified as endangered. The Commission intends to provide special attention to vulnerable or threatened shark stocks in its Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Sharks to be presented to the Council and to Parliament by the end of 2008. The precise timing for the implementation of the action plan has not yet been established, as it will very much depend on the measures actually included in the Plan, adopted by the Commission, once it has been approved by the Council and the Parliament. The Commission, will however, start working on a first set of proposals to be submitted to the Council immediately after the adoption of the action plan.
