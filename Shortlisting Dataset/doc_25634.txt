Answer given by Mr Figel' on behalf of the Commission (11 July 2008) According to Article 2 of the decision on the Lifelong Learning Programme http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_327/l_32720061124en00450068.pdf , OJ L 327, 24.11.2006. , which includes Erasmus, a ‘higher education institution’ is defined as any type of higher education institution that offers recognised degrees or other recognised tertiary level qualifications. In addition, Article 20 provides that the relevant national authority of each participating country shall specify which institutions fall under this category. Only a university recognised as eligible by a competent national authority may apply for an Erasmus Charter which is the basis for cooperation between the sending and hosts institutions, facilitating Erasmus student mobility. As a result, studying in a university situated in a Member State is not alone a sufficient condition to be eligible for an Erasmus student mobility grant. European or third-country students enrolled in universities which are not eligible for the Erasmus programme cannot benefit from an Erasmus mobility grant. As far as the Erasmus Mundus programme is concerned, Article 2 of the underlying decision http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/mundus/decision_en.pdf , OJ L 345, 31.12.2003. defines a ‘third-country graduate student’ as a national of a third country who has not carried out his or her main activity (studies, work, etc.), for more than a total of 12 months over the last five years, in any of the Member States or participating countries. According to the Commission's information, the student from Palestine, referred to by the Honourable Member, had carried out his studies for more than a total of 12 months over the last five years in a university situated in the northern part of Cyprus, i.e. in the Member State Cyprus. Consequently, he was not eligible to apply for the Erasmus Mundus scholarship.
