Question for written answer E-001159/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marek Henryk Migalski (ECR) (14 February 2011) Subject: Peaceful demonstrators detained in Russia On 31 January 2011 demonstrations were held in Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian towns in defence of Article 31 of the Russian Constitution. In Moscow the police detained 54 demonstrators, and in St Petersburg some 100 people, including bystanders and members of the media. The day before, 30 January, the police had searched the premises of members of The Other Russia party and the Strategy 31 campaign that were organising the demonstrations. The premises searched included the flat of the head of the Other Russia’s Moscow branch, Nikolai Avdyushenkov, and the headquarters of the Strategy 31 organising committee. One Other Russia party activists, Igor Berezyuk, was arrested. Although the right of assembly is guaranteed under the Russian Constitution, taking part in peaceful demonstrations and attempting to voice one’s opinions in public can lead to detention, arrest and trial on criminal charges. The right of assembly is being restricted in an increasing number of cases in Russia. In view of this, what practical steps have been taken in response to the arrests which always occur after demonstrations held in defence of Article 31 of the Russian Constitution? Furthermore, have the discussions conducted with the Russian authorities during the periodic EU-Russia human rights meetings yielded any concrete results in the form of assurances from those authorities that human rights and civil liberties will be upheld in Russia?
