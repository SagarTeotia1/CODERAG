mutual recognition, measures should be taken, involving the placing of limits on the number of elements that the competent authority may examine, so as to make it easier to obtain an entry-into-service authorisation in a Member State other than the one which issued the initial authorisation. (3) To this end, all of the technical and safety rules in force in each Member State should be classified under three groups and the results of this classification presented in a reference document. The first group should cover the international rules along with any national rules that have been declared equivalent and in respect of which a check carried out in a single Member State is sufficient in railway safety terms. The second group should cover all other national rules as well as rules that have not yet been classified. The third group should cover the rules that are necessary to ensure technical compatibility between the rolling stock featuring in the authorisation application and the envisaged infrastructure. (4) The European Railway Agency, set up under Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 OJ L 164, 30.4.2004, p 1. Corrected version in OJ L 220, 21.6.2004, p. 3 . , has a mandate to develop technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs), and must therefore, as a first step, examine the existing national technical rules. Furthermore, under Directive 2004/49/EC, it must publish the national safety rules. Lastly, it must harmonise the criteria for the safety certification of the railway undertakings – a task that will also include requirements governing the acceptance of the rolling stock used by these undertakings. Consequently, the Agency is the most appropriate body to devise the abovementioned reference document. (5) Following developments at international level and, in particular, following the entry into force of the new Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail ( 1999 COTIF Convention ) , it is necessary to define the concept of "wagon keeper" and to specify the relationship between railway undertakings and keepers, notably in the field of maintenance. (6) Since the main objective of the proposed action, namely the simplification of the Community procedure for the certification of railway rolling stock, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (7) Directive 2004/49/EC provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. Decision as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC (OJ L 200, 22.7.2006, p. 11). . (8) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced the regulatory control procedure with scrutiny for the adoption of measures of general scope and designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic
