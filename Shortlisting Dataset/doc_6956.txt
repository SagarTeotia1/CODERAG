and identity, which the Joint Portuguese-Chinese Declaration has undertaken to defend, with particular reference to constitutional government, the upholding of human rights and basic freedoms (including cultural tolerance and freedom of religion and worship) and the genuine autonomy of the SAR and its constituent bodies (within both the Executive and the SAR's own independent legislative and judicial systems), the preservation of which is inseparable from the principle of 'one country, two systems', and urges the European Union to keep a close watch to ensure the full implementation of these provisions; 4. Is convinced that the preservation of Macao's particular culture and of its people's identity, which the EU must encourage, is a cornerstone of its autonomy and future prosperity; 5. Welcomes the fact that the Joint Portuguese-Chinese Declaration guarantees the continuity of the existing legal system, based on the legislative structures of mainland Europe and the principle of the rule of law, together with the existence of an independent judiciary, including the final court of appeal; 6. Welcomes the continuation, after the transfer of powers, of the EU-Macao Trade and Cooperation Agreement of 1993, which provides a permanent framework for direct dialogue between the Macao SAR and the European Union, in particular thanks to the preservation of the structures created by that agreement, including the annual Joint Committee; 7. Calls on the EU and its Member States to develop closer economic and trade relations with Macao, making good use of the potential of a promising economy, as already manifested by the territory over the period of transition between the Portuguese administration and that of the People's Republic of China, and as will be the case in the future; stresses the factors of economic and financial autonomy and the fact that Macao is a separate customs territory; 8. Urges the EU to support the international autonomy of the Macao SAR, by negotiating directly with Macao as an international partner in the areas of its autonomy, promoting Macao's participation in international organisations and forums in line with its status, and keeping a close watch on the application of international instruments to Macao; 9. In this context calls on the Chinese National People's Congress to ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights signed by China in 1998; 10. Urges the Commission to find ways to strengthen and consolidate Macao civil society and to promote and further develop the multiparty system and democratic institutions; 11. Urges all the Member States to exempt passport holders of the Macao SAR from visa requirements, since this would make a significant contribution to the preservation of Macao's way of life and would strengthen and facilitate economic and other contacts, as well as testifying to the Union's confidence in Macao's future; 12. Expresses its commitment to regularly monitoring developments in Macao after 20 December 1999, on the basis of close exchange of information and interinstitutional cooperation, analysing and debating the regular reports to be submitted and evaluating developments in the area of rights, freedoms and guarantees and all aspects of current circumstances related to Macao, in the context of
