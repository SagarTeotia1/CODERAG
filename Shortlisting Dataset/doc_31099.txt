WRITTEN QUESTION E-2952/10 by Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) to the Commission (3 May 2010) Subject: Compliance with the European Charter for minority languages in Navarre The organisation Euskara Kultur Elkargoa produced a report more than a year ago on compliance with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in the Autonomous Community of Navarre, where Basque is spoken. The report’s findings confirm that the authorities in Navarre are not meeting the Charter’s minimum requirements to ensure that the Basque language is preserved. In recent months, the Navarre Regional Government has stepped up the measures condemned in the report, consolidating a situation where equal standing for the Autonomous Community’s two official languages is being hampered across the region, where people cannot freely choose which language to use as this right is not recognised by the authorities, language rights are not being protected and positive actions to promote the minority language are being cut back. The way in which students in Navarre who choose Basque as their language of communication are being prevented at the same time from taking immersion courses in other European languages, such as English, speaks for itself. 1. Are the measures adopted by the Navarre Regional Government in regard to the Basque language consistent with the Commission’s philosophy of protecting multilingualism? 2. Does the Commission’s work programme include a plan to measure the effectiveness of Member States’ policies promoting minority languages? If not, are there any plans for such a measure? 3. What criteria does the Commission use in order to protect minority languages while promoting, in those regions where they are spoken, the languages of other EU countries?
