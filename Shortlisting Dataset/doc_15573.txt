several institutions and organisations of European interest into three legislative programmes (Citizens for Europe, Culture 2007 and Lifelong Learning), 1. Recalls that communication and educational programmes are the instrument of choice for better informing and including citizens in the debate on the constitutional treaty and that they are the principal means for providing support for the constitutional roadmap laid out in the President's conclusions of the European Council in June 2006; 2. Regrets that many European citizens at present do not perceive any benefits of the further integration of the European Union; notes, however, that at the same time a majority of citizens in most Member States would welcome a more transparent and effective constitutional settlement of the EU and its policies; 3. Reiterates that communication activities can only work satisfactorily if academic institutions, foundations (including those of the political parties), regional and local authorities, social partners, and civil society (especially youth and women's organisations) are actively contributing to them and that they need financial resources from the EU budget to carry out these tasks; considers, therefore, that the amounts proposed in the PDB 2007 for the Prince budget line for the future of Europe debate and the EU's information outlets are insufficient and must be substantially increased, compared to the 2006 expenditures with a view to the ongoing period of reflection and analysis; 4. Stresses that a number of institutes and organisations have provided outstanding support for the debate on the future of Europe; is hence concerned about the Council’s intention, as displayed in the legislative procedure leading to the adoption of the Europe for citizens programme, to limit the structural assistance for some of the institutes of European interest to three years (2007-2009); is determined to ensure adequate permanent funding for these research and educational groups beyond the horizon of the present period of reflection and analysis because it is convinced that they have important tasks of a permanent character; 5. Insists that the increase proposed by the Commission of the funds made available to these institutes is not in all cases sufficient to tackle the challenging tasks before them; 6. Welcomes the Council’s and the Parliament's recent efforts better to include citizens in their daily work, especially as concerns transparency of legislation and political debate on sensitive issues such as globalisation and enlargement; undertakes further to step up these activities and invites the Council to do so likewise.
