WRITTEN QUESTION E-0655/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (23 February 2005) Subject: Non-recognition by Greece of Braille script Greek organisations for the blind claim that Greece has not yet recognised the Braille script or method of reading. Does the Commission know why Greece has not recognised this script? Have the other Member States done so? What provision does Community legislation make for the recognition by the Member States of Braille script which has helped blind people over a period of decades?
