Question for written answer E-004543/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Charalampos Angourakis (GUE/NGL) (11 May 2011) Subject: Special schools must not be closed The policy applied in Greece, by the PASOK Government together with the EU, ECB and IMF, has led — among other dire consequences for working people — to drastic cuts in social spending. Among the victims of this policy are young people, who are feeling the effects of swinging cuts in public spending on education. For children with special needs, the effects are even more dramatic: they are now facing a direct threat to their mental and physical health. A typical example of the consequences of this policy is the Special Primary School and Nursery for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children in Ambelokipi, Athens, which is about to close, at the very time when the problems of children with special needs are becoming particularly acute because of the lack of infrastructure, lack of special schools and specialist teaching and auxiliary staff, etc. Does the Commission think this policy of the Greek Government, the EU and the IMF should continue, despite the fact that it has disastrous consequences for children, and especially the most vulnerable among them, those with special needs, so that even their health is put at enormous risk?
