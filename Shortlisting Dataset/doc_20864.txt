Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (5 January 2009) The progress made by the Member States since 2003 towards the target of halving the number of fatalities on European roads by 2010 varies from country to country. However, where significant progress has been made, it is without doubt due, for the most part, to the firm commitment given at the highest political level. European Road Safety Day, which took place in several EU Member States on 13 October 2008, provided an opportunity to remind European citizens of this commitment and to accentuate it. The purpose of these annual events is to boost efforts to tackle road safety issues and to promote the exchange of experience between players on the ground in the various Member States. They are targeted at the general public and are aimed at bringing Europe closer to the people.
