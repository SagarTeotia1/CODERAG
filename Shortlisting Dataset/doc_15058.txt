commitment in 2010 for a programme to support the modernisation of the administration of justice and the enhancement of security. Support is also being provided to civil society organisations in the framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, through projects aimed at fostering a culture of human rights and promoting the democratic process. The EU General Affairs Council conclusions of November 2009 reaffirmed the strong commitment of the European Union to the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief. The EU attaches great importance to the freedom of religion and belief in its dialogues with all countries. Religious freedom as a fundamental human right as well as the rights of people belonging to religious minorities are addressed through the EU's bilateral political dialogues and, when appropriate, through démarches and public declarations, as well as through EU action in fora such as the UN Human Rights Council or the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. The EU also supports the work of the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Religion and Belief, Dr Asma Jahangir. The Commission funds worldwide, under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, projects addressing discrimination and minority issues.
