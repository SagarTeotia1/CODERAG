WRITTEN QUESTION E-0559/08 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (8 February 2008) Subject: Information on the use of funds from the Civil Protection Financial Instrument by the municipality of Massa The European Union's financial framework for 2007‑13 includes numerous programmes aimed at supporting Community policies in areas such as research and technological development, training programmes, promotion of the arts, environment, transport, energy and health and consumer protection. The municipality of Massa (Tuscany) appears to be particularly in need of European funding in order to improve cooperation in civil protection assistance interventions and speed up response times in the event of major emergencies. In the light of the above, will the Commission say: 1. whether the municipality of Massa has submitted any projects under the Civil Protection Financial Instrument programme? 2. whether that municipality has obtained funding and, if not, on what grounds it was refused? 3. if funds were obtained, whether they were used within the stipulated period and, if not, whether the Commission has asked for the sums granted to be returned?
