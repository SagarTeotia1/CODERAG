the Commission launched a study in 2006 on legalisation. Once completed, this study will include a comparative analysis of the laws and procedures of the Member States in this field as well as an empirical analysis of the practical problems encountered by citizens and businesses in the EU as a result of the making of requirements for legalisation. It will also contain an analysis of the working of the Hague Convention of 1961 within the EU. In addition, the Commission published a call for tender in 2006 for a comparative study into civil status records with the aim of identifying the practical difficulties encountered by citizens in this area. These two studies should provide a solid basis for the Commission to assess what measures could be taken at EU level to improve the situation.
