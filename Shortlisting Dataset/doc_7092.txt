ORAL QUESTION H-1032/05 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Adamos Adamou to the Commission Subject: Continuing construction of the wall on Palestinian territory Parliament's Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council recently visited the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the visit, the Delegation was personally able to observe the continuing construction of the wall. The wall which will, in future, separate the State of Israel from the State of Palestine continues to be built and, in many instances, within the green line, i.e. the 1967 borders, meaning that the actual land ultimately to be given to the Palestinians to found their State will be less than 22% of their historical territory as provided by the Road Map. Moreover, the wall completely surrounds the city of Jerusalem, thereby excluding East Jerusalem from Palestinian territory, which the Palestinians consider to be a 'red line' as they have repeatedly stated that they cannot accept any solution which does not provide for East Jerusalem to be the capital of their State. How does the Commission intend to help ensure that Israel stops building the wall which, in addition to all the abovementioned political problems, is also creating enormous humanitarian problems?
