WRITTEN QUESTION E-4099/08 by Neil Parish (PPE-DE) to the Commission (18 July 2008) Subject: Veterinary qualifications The Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications (2005/36/EC OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 22 . ) allows professionals, including veterinarians to have their qualifications recognised throughout Europe and to practice in any EU Member State. However, the Joint Education Committee, which is charged with the evaluation of veterinary education establishments recently declared some veterinary schools in Estonia, Italy, Spain and Slovakia to be deficient. Veterinarians who have graduated from these schools can continue to practice throughout the EU as their diplomas are recognised in the Annex of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications. Is the European Commission aware of the potential threat that this poses to both animal and public health and what measures does it intend to take to solve these problems?
