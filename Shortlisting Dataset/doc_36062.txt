WRITTEN QUESTION E-2289/04 by Ignasi Guardans Cambó (ALDE/ADLE) to the Commission (5 October 2004) Subject: Ecological damage to the Serra Mariola (Valencian Autonomous Community) The Valencian Generalitat has earmarked areas of major ecological value, likely to qualify as sites of Community interest, for the installation of 28 wind farm schemes. In zone 15 of the Valencian wind farm plan, 6 wind farms are scheduled, comprising 109 wind turbines. Independent studies indicate that there is no optimum, strong and constant wind force (between 9 and 25 metres per second) in the areas chosen in the Serra Mariola (zone 15), to guarantee the profitability of these installations. European Union funding will thus be used to subsidise ecological damage to areas of high environmental value; the goal of the companies which have won the building contracts (most of them involving Iberdrola), is to obtain Union funds. Is the Commission aware of independent studies of the wind force in zone 15?
