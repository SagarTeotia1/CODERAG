ORAL QUESTION H-0188/03 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by María Sornosa Martínez to the Commission Subject: Sending of a Spanish single-hull tanker to the Iraq war The Spanish Government has decided to send the military oil tanker Marqués de la Ensenada to support the allied troops engaged in the Iraq war. The Marques de la Ensenada is a single-hull tanker and was built in 1990. Following the Erika and Prestige disasters, the Commission has been undertaking valuable work aimed at banning single-hull tankers, particularly in the context of the revision of Regulation (EC) 417/2002 . Any war situation involves an increased risk of possible shipwreck caused by enemy attack, and hence the increased risk of a fresh black tide. Does the Commission not consider that it would at least be prudent and desirable if this type of single-hull oil tanker did not take part in dangerous missions? Will the Commission ask the Spanish authorities to withdraw the single-hull tanker from the conflict zone in order to avert the risk of a fresh black tide? OJ L 64, 7.3.2002, p. 1.
