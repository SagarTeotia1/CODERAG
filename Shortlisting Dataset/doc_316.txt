exercise of the accompanying voting rights, in domestic companies by other EU investors, is also considered to be a form of capital movement Communication, op. cit., paragraph 2.3. These points have been confirmed by the recent ECJ rulings, among others, in cases C-483/99, Commission v France , C-367/98, Commission v Portugal , C-503/99 Commission v Belgium , C463/00 Commission v Spain , C 98/01 Commission v UK and C-174/04 Commission v Italy . . The fact that Artigiancassa, a part of BNL that was taken over by BNP-Paribas, manages national and community public funds, such as the regional funds co-financed by the European Community, does not change this view. The acquisition of BNL by BNP Paribas, was authorised by the Commission under the Merger Regulation on 28 March 2006 See press notice IP/06/394, 28 March 2006. .
