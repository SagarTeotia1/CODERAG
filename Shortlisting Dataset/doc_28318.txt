existing consumer protection acquis is a distinctive area of Community law which reflects the EU legislature's concern to deliver a high level of consumer protection in accordance with the Treaties, and although it is clear that the European contract law initiative has a wider remit of securing and developing the coherence of contract law as a whole, this exercise should not lead to a dilution of the values at the heart of the existing consumer protection acquis , 1. Considers that the development of a Common Frame of Reference (CFR) could be of benefit to the functioning of the internal market, but that it must be properly resourced in terms of staffing at the Commission; 2. Calls on the Commission to act in the closest possible cooperation with the Parliament in every step undertaken towards developing a CFR; is of the opinion that Parliament should be formally consulted first on the draft structure and subsequently on each title or section of the CFR (depending on its final structure) as it is finalised before it is ultimately consulted on the final instrument; 3. Supports the Commission in its efforts at better law-making, but emphasises that the work done by researchers in developing the CFR must follow clear guidelines given by the EU legislature; 4. Asks the Commission to assist clarification of the research and stakeholder processes by the production of an organisational diagram and/or flow chart which clearly identifies all the different groups, working groups, parties and so on which are involved, thereby indicating their role and position in the processes; 5. Calls on the Commission to submit to Parliament a formal plan for the incremental consultation of Parliament as the work progresses, and for the ultimate implementation of the results of the work of the researchers and CFR-Net to be adopted in the form of a binding legal instrument (or instruments) on the basis of Articles 95 and/or 153 of the Treaty; 6. Considers it desirable for the Commission, on the basis of the researchers’ final report, to submit the various possible legal options to the Parliament, and recalls that the CFR can only finally be adopted following political approval by the Parliament and the Council; 7. Insists that the Commission itself must adopt a horizontal approach, so as to involve in particular DG Justice, Freedom and Security and DG Internal Market and Services, while guaranteeing the utmost transparency at every stage of the process; 8. Welcomes the Commission's First Annual Progress Report and endorses its thoughtful and measured approach to the revision of the consumer protection acquis ; 9. Points out that undue emphasis must not be placed on business-to-business contracts at the expense of business-to-consumer contracts, and that any rationalisation of the consumer protection acquis will be political and necessitate the closest possible involvement of Parliament; 10. Reminds the Commission that the term "business" covers more that just large corporations and includes small - even one-person - undertakings which will often require contracts specially tailored to their needs and which take account of their relative vulnerability when contracting with large
