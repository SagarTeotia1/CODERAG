Question for written answer E-4028/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (7 June 2010) Subject: Apprentice wage rate Many European countries have adopted an apprentice wage rate. A study carried out by the EIRO (European Industrial Relations Observatory) identified nine countries which applied the system in 2008, where the rate is usually a specific percentage of the Member State's basic wage. 1. Does the Commission have data showing that there is a link between this system and an increase in jobs and employment where it was applied? 2. In the context of the 2020 strategy to increase employment and combat unemployment, does the Commission intend to encourage such programmes by providing the Member States with Community aid?
