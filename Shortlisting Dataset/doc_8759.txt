WRITTEN QUESTION P-0279/06 by Joseph Muscat (PSE) to the Commission (26 January 2006) Subject: Translation of ‘euro’ As it is the European Union's declared policy to encourage diversity and to strengthen the different languages of the European Union, is it not the Commission's opinion that it should fully support the logical and simple stand of the National Council of the Maltese language that ‘ewro’ should be the name for the single European currency? Is it not the Commission's opinion that other institutions should follow the example set by itself and the European Parliament who already refer to the single currency as ‘ewro’ on their Internet sites' web pages? (see: http://europa.eu.int/abc/travel/money/index_mt.htm and http://www.europarl.eu.int/news/public/story_page/043-996-255-9-37-907-20050819STO00995-2005-12-09-2005/default_mt.htm)
