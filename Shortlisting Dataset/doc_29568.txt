WRITTEN QUESTION E-3098/09 by Dan Jørgensen (PSE) to the Commission (24 April 2009) Subject: Use of the powerful greenhouse gas sulphuryl fluoride in the EU An article was published in the online version of the professional journal Ingeniøren on Tuesday, 17 March concerning the hazardous greenhouse gas, sulphuryl fluoride. According to American researchers, the gas has a 4 800 times greater effect on global warming than CO 2 and it is further reported that the lifespan of the gas in the atmosphere is 36 years, i.e. eight years longer than originally supposed. It should also be noted that the quantity of sulphuryl fluoride used is increasing by 5 % per year. Sulphuryl fluoride has recently been proposed for approval as an active substance in biocides in the EU. In view of the particularly problematic impact on climate of the substance's use, would the Commission answer the following questions? — Can the Commission provide a general assessment of the applications for which sulphuryl fluoride is used and in what quantities in the EU? What is the trend in its consumption? — Does the Commission agree with the American researchers that sulphuryl fluoride has a negative impact on global warming and, if not, will it provide documentation to substantiate its view that the substance does not contribute to global warming? — What initiatives does the Commission intend to take with a view to phasing out and banning the use of sulphuryl fluoride in various applications, including the initiatives it intends to take with a view to finding alternatives to this substance? — When does the Commission expect to be able to introduce a total ban and what, in its view, are the current obstacles to such a ban?
