WRITTEN QUESTION E-1818/10 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 March 2010) Subject: Taxation of financial transactions In view of the decisions taken on the taxation of financial transactions, the regulation of financial markets and the abolition of tax havens, and since such measures are liable to generate substantial revenue by comparison with existing sources of tax revenue - essential at a time when more resources are needed for investment in productive activity and in quality public services in order to deal with increasing unemployment and poverty - can the Commission state: 1. what measures have been or will be taken with a view to abolishing tax havens, at least within the EU; 2. what measures have been or will be taken to encourage Member States to tax transactions on the financial markets and the stock exchange, and especially profits, with a view to ensuring the creation of jobs with rights and fighting poverty?
