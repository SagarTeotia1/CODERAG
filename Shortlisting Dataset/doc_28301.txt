9999/C Q999 E/051 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1379/04 by Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 April 2004) Subject: Equal treatment of all European Union citizens Mr Nicolaos Amarantides, a Greek national born on 24 July 1951, lived and worked in Belgium between 1981 and 1994 and is serving a sentence of four years imprisonment at Forest prison Brussels, complying with a decision of the Brussels Court of Appeal on an application to set aside a judgement. He has already served 20 months of his sentence. Under Belgian law, he would normally be entitled to a release on parole. However the administration of the Ministry of Justice will not consider this release on parole because he does not have a valid residence permit. Mr Amarantides' situation is contrary to the principle of equal treatment of all citizens in the European Union. What measures does the Commission plan to take vis-à-vis the Belgian authorities on this matter?
