Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (8 July 2011) The Commission is paying close attention to the practices raised by the Honourable Member, and which pose a threat to EU competitiveness. Such practices confirm the need for an ambitious policy regarding research and innovation in the EU, such as the ongoing reflections regarding a common strategic framework for research and innovation funding. China indeed gives rise to serious concerns regarding the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs), and is characterised by a high level of IPR infringement. In 2009, according to EU Custom statistics, 64 % of the goods intercepted at the EU border, suspected of infringing IP rights, originated from China. The Commission is closely monitoring such Chinese policies, including the indigenous innovation policy, and is also taking concrete steps to influence them, e.g. through the Intellectual Property Dialogue and Intellectual Property Working Group the Commission has set up with Chinese authorities. In this context, the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, in her visit to China on 20-26 May 2011, raised with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) the idea of creating a specific task force on research and innovation to address the issues of IPR and technology transfer with Chinese partners.
