WRITTEN QUESTION E-0363/05 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (8 February 2005) Subject: European Travel Pass Commission Recommendation 89/350/EEC OJ L 144, 27.5.1989, p. 59 . called for a Community-wide over-sixties' card to facilitate access to travel and other concessions across Europe. In its answer to Written Question E-1054/99 OJ C 348, 3.12.1999, p. 148 . in May 1999, the Commission referred to ‘practical difficulties’ encountered by the Member States in implementing this Recommendation. It stated that feasibility studies commissioned in 1993 and 1997 led it to conclude that the number and variety of schemes, combined with the constantly changing situation, made it difficult to gain an accurate up-to-date picture at European level. Nevertheless, it ‘remained convinced of the usefulness of a Community-wide older persons’ card in promoting a stronger sense of European citizenship'. It added that it was discussing the conclusions and recommendations of the latest feasibility report with Member State representatives. In its answer to Written Question E-2406/99 OJ C 225 E, 8.8.2000, p. 126 . in 2000, the Commission stated that NGO members of the Liaison Group for Older People ‘did not come forward in support of the suggestions in the final report of the study, for example in the context of the preparation of the UN international year of older persons’ and ‘in this light, the Commission has no present intention to come forward with any proposals for a senior EURO pass or over sixties’ card.' What initiatives has the Commission taken since then? Does it remain convinced that a Europe-wide older persons' card would help promote a stronger sense of European citizenship, particularly in the context of the post-2006 Community Action Programme to promote Active Citizenship.
