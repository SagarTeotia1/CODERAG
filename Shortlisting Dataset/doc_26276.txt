SDS cannot be attained without addressing current inequalities and making better use of the potential of both men and women; underlines, therefore, the fact that social inclusion must be understood in its broadest sense, including the gender dimension; 15. Considers, therefore, that a limited number of intermediate and long-term targets should either be reconfirmed or established, should be based on the precautionary principle and be ambitious and realistic in nature, and should then be properly and systematically applied and monitored; believes that they should address, in particular, current negative trends in the fields of land use and land resources, transport, climate change, fisheries, use of fossil fuels and depletion of biodiversity, and should also seek to encourage modal shift, the decoupling of economic growth from transport, and greenhouse-gas emission reductions in line with max+2°C warming as compared to pre-industrial levels; 16. Supports the proposed new emphasis on seeking to measure resource efficiency through application of environmental resource accounting; suggests that special efforts should be made to monitor closely the ecological footprint of the EU in the world, analysing environmental impact from both the consumption and the production end, and setting as a target that the EU footprint be systematically reduced; 17. Welcomes, moreover, the Commission's proposal for a European Year of combating poverty and social exclusion; urges the Commission to put forward more specific initiatives and efficient implementation measures to enable real progress to be made; points in this connection, by way of example, to the Commission's initiative aimed at analysing the impact of an ageing society, which seeks to achieve concrete solutions based on the participation both of the various levels of political decision-makers in the EU and of civil society; Improving the quality of growth as a precondition for the SDS 18. Considers that the emphasis placed on GDP in measuring progress in society should be balanced by an equal concern about the qualitative aspects of growth, as this is a prerequisite for sustainable development; believes, therefore, that agreement needs to be reached on a limited set of key sustainability indicators to be presented and widely discussed at the yearly review of the SDS; considers that these indicators should pertain to fundamental aspects of the quality of life and should allow quantitative and prompt assessments of health (quality and distribution of health care, life expectancy, child mortality, etc.), awareness (education and culture, ICT access, etc.), inclusion (participation in society's decisions and social capital, etc.) and environmental quality (air and water pollution, etc.); 19. Calls for the further development of the European social model and for recommendations, on the basis of that model, that the Member States take action to counteract the "unsustainable" trends of poverty, social exclusion and the consequences of the ageing of society; considers that, to this end, social situation indicators should be developed which would then be included in the sustainability impact assessment; emphasises that Europe needs a macroeconomic framework to support sustainable development, strengthening environmentally friendly internal demand, employment and social cohesion; 20. Considers that sustainable development should be seen more as an economic opportunity than
