Answer given by Mrs de Palacio on behalf of the Commission (18 October 2004) The table below shows the modal split of freight traffic for the year 2002 for each of the Member States: It should be noted that the statistical definitions used for road transport in the ten new Member States have not yet been brought fully into line with those of the EU15 and could lead to an overestimation for road and an underestimation for rail transport within the total traffic of the new Member States. The table only contains data regarding land transport, as the estimates for EU25 maritime traffic are still being calculated and will not be available before the beginning of 2005. Commission estimates of EU15 traffic give a modal split of 44.7% for road, 40.8% for shipping, 7.7% for rail, 4.1% for inland waterways and 2.8% for pipelines. Due to the volume of information requested, more detailed statistical tables for the past 10 years are being sent directly to the Honourable Member and to the Parliament’s Secretariat.
