Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (26 June 2008) The United Kingdom (UK) may pursuant to Article 22 of Directive […] on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (entry into force pending), notify the Commission that it intends to postpone the deadline for complying with the limit values for nitrogen dioxide or benzene in zones or agglomerations where those limit values cannot be complied with by 1 January 2010, or that it fulfils the conditions for an exemption from the obligation to apply the limit values for particulate matter (PM 10 ) in a zone or agglomeration where those limit values are currently exceeded. The UK must show that the conditions for a postponement or exemption are met and it must establish an air quality plan for each zone or agglomeration concerned that demonstrates how conformity will be achieved before the new deadlines for compliance, i.e. 2015 at the latest for nitrogen dioxide and benzene, and in June 2011 for PM 10 . In the zones or agglomerations concerned limit values continue to apply but may be exceeded by no more than the maximum margin of tolerance specified in Annex XI of the directive (i.e. max. 35 days above 75 micrograms/m3 for daily PM 10 limit value, 48 micrograms/m3 for annual PM 10 limit value, and 48 micrograms/m3 for nitrogen dioxide limit value). Outside those zones and agglomerations, air quality limit values continue to apply unchanged. After the new deadline in June 2011 for PM 10 and January 2015 at the latest for nitrogen dioxide, limit values need to be respected throughout the territory. The Commission will assess the notifications thoroughly and raise objections within nine months of receipt if it finds that the conditions are not fulfilled.
