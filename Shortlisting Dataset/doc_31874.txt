Reply (18 January 2010) Concerning the establishment of freight corridors, the Council would point out that the establishment of initial freight corridors according to the list of principal routes of freight corridors set out in Annex I of the Common Position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning a European rail network for competitive freight 11069/09. was a policy choice based on the assessment of the corridors most likely to lead to a successful implementation. It took into account the criteria set out in Annex II. In particular, recital 9 of the Common Position underlines that the international rail corridors for a European rail network for competitive freight should be set up in a manner consistent with the Trans-European Transport Network (‘TEN-T’) and/or the European Railway Traffic Management System (‘ERTMS’) corridors. Concerning the extensions of the principal routes set out in Annex I, it should be noted that the use of a ‘/’ between the locations provides for alternative routes. Accordingly, it would be possible for Member States concerned to establish under the principal route No 6 a freight corridor directly between Almería — Valencia — Barcelona with its continuation to France.
