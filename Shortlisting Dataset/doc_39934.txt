Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (8 March 2007) The United Nations (UN) Secretary General has appointed President Ahtisaari as his Special Envoy with a mandate to make a comprehensive proposal for a status settlement for Kosovo that takes into account the Contact Group’s principles. The Contact Group ministerial statement in January 2006 recalled ‘that the specific character of the Kosovo problem, shaped by the disintegration of Yugoslavia and consequent conflicts, ethnic cleansing and the events of 1999, and the extended period of international administration under the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244, must be fully taken into account in settling Kosovo's status.’ On 2 February 2007, President Ahtisaari submitted to both parties his comprehensive proposal which integrates the above parameters. The Commission expects both parties to engage in the coming weeks with President Ahtisaari in a constructive way and to discuss the proposal, in a spirit of compromise. The Commission is fully committed to supporting the implementation of the status once settled and to foster the European perspective of both Serbia and Kosovo.
