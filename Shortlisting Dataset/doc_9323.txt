Question for written answer E-011051/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (7 January 2011) Subject: Subsidies for exports to the Dominican Republic Arla Foods, created in 2000 by the merger of MD Foods (Denmark) and Arla (Sweden), is Europe’s biggest dairy company, with an annual turnover exceeding EUR 5 billion. The company, whose head office is in Denmark, is a cooperative of Danish and Swedish milk producers that also has subsidiaries outside Europe, namely in the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas. Arla Foods exports its milk powder even to the Dominican Republic, a Caribbean island crippled by poverty. All of the leading milk powder brands — Milex, Alaska, Nido, Nutra, Ultra Milk, and Anchor — can be found on the shelves of the new supermarket in San Francisco de Macoris. The trade names are legion, but what lies behind them in reality is a handful of transnational giants in the Nestlé mould. Competition in the shape of subsidised milk powder imported from the EU is one of the reasons for the financial difficulties that Dominican national dairies are now suffering. This situation is absurd. On the one hand, the EU is helping to finance a major agri-food project, Prolino, aimed at boosting national milk production. At the same time, it is subsidising the exports of Arla Foods and other dairy companies, which are driving Dominican products out of the market. The fall in milk production has affected large and small producers alike. — Given that it is calling for ever greater coherence and consistency in its development aid programmes, can the Commission explain how it can take decisions with such incongruous effects? — Is it seeking to favour large agri-food industries at the expense of small local producers, flying in the face of the goals charted in its recent communication on the future of the CAP after 2013?
