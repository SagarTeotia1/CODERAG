Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (16 August 2010) Timetables can be protected by a under the Database Directive (96/9/EC) OJ L 077, 27.3.1996 p. 0020‑0028. , if the database reflects a substantial investment in the obtaining, verifying or presentation of the information contained in the database. According to the 1996 Database Directive the producer of a protected database may prevent the extraction and or reutilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the content of a protected database. The core issue that arises in the case mentioned by the Honourable Member is whether the NMBS/SNCB expended substantial investment in obtaining, verifying and presenting the information displayed in its train timetable. Whether this is the case, requires a case-by-case determination of the professional and financial investment incurred in obtaining the relevant information, verifying its accuracy and presenting it as part of an online database (the NMBS/SNCB website). Such an analysis can only be provided by a national court after a thorough analysis of the circumstances of each individual case. To complete its answer, the Commission invites the Honourable Member to refer to its reply given to Written Question H‑0350/10 Available at http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB by Mr EL KHADRAOUI.
