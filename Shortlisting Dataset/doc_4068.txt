Question for written answer E-011146/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sir Graham Watson (ALDE) (30 November 2011) Subject: Article 13 claims under Regulation (EC) No 1924/2009 European consumers have the right to know whether some foods which claim to have a beneficial impact on their health actually have such an effect. Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2009 requires the European Food Standard Agency’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) to publish evaluations of over two-and-a-half thousand general function claims on botanical substances. However, in its opinions the NDA has rejected around 95 % of claims for plant-based foods, relating to foods like berries, broccoli and pomegranate, as well as the laxative effect of prunes. Is the Commission satisfied at the assessment criteria and methodology used to draw up the proposed list of nutritional health claims? Is the Commission concerned that any obvious health effects have been omitted from the list by the criteria used?
