WRITTEN QUESTION E-4088/09 by Sajjad Karim (ECR) to the Council (10 August 2009) Subject: Halting of aid ship bound for Gaza I understand that on 29 June 2009 the Spirit of Humanity , an aid ship bound for Gaza, was commandeered and detained by the Israeli authorities. The aid shipment had been organised by the Free Gaza Movement and the ship had departed Cyprus on 27 June 2009. Israeli forces stopped the vessel from entering the coastal waters of Gaza on security grounds and because this would breach an existing naval blockade. On board the ship were activists from various countries and these people were arrested, detained and charged with ‘illegal entry into Israel’ (despite having not intended to enter the country). Does the Council condemn this action by the Israeli forces? Has the Council raised this issue with the Israeli representatives to the European Union?
