Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (23 November 2006) 1. The implementation of the 2004‑06 programming period is well advanced in Hungary. At the end of September 2006, 100 % of the total three-year European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) allocation had been committed on the ground and 95 % contracted. Regarding the level of payments, Hungary is the second best performing Member State in an EU‑10 comparison. The payment target for 2006 to avoid an automatic de-commitment at the end of this year has been met for all operational programmes. The current period also serves as preparation for the management of the substantially increased funding which Hungary will receive from 2007 onwards. Experiences of the current period will be valuable to ensure the efficient use of funding in the next period. Since March 2005, the Hungarian authorities have taken significant steps to simplify project selection, contracting procedures and payment processes. However, further simplification of contracting and payment procedures could be made, amongst other, the reduction of the administrative burden for applicants, the possibility of applying electronically for funding or the electronic submission of invoices. A number of changes have been introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund OJ L 210, 31.7.2006. , with a view to providing further simplification. Simplification at the level of the Regulations should be accompanied by simplification on the ground. Ongoing negotiations on the National Strategic Reference Framework and the Operational Programmes should ensure that funding is made available for addressing the socioeconomic development needs of Hungary. 2. The Commission does not take a position on internal discussions in the Member States.
