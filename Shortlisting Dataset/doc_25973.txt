WRITTEN QUESTION E-1183/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (26 February 2009) Subject: Personal data storage centre in the United Kingdom A leading British daily has reported that, to help combat terrorism and protect internal security, the British Government is electronically ‘mapping’ the credit card purchases of the British population, numbering some 60 million. By 2014 the plan should enable records to be produced on all those entering and leaving the country, approximately 250 million in all. In the digital age, citizens are being increasingly subjected to checks of every kind, the aims of which, though declared to be lawful and legitimate in terms of the public interest, sometimes threaten to negate respect for the fundamental rights accorded to each individual: in this specific case, for the right to freedom and privacy. A data centre that keeps records of landline and mobile telephones, credit cards, accommodation and transport bookings, travel agencies, and the like appears to go beyond the proper limits. In addition, there is a risk that, especially in Italy and other countries where e-commerce is less widespread, citizens might be deterred from paying by credit card and similar means because they would know that their movements were being recorded. The end effect would, in short, run counter to the EU’s efforts to bring about a wider and more even spread of information and communications technologies. Does the Commission not believe, therefore, that what is happening in the United Kingdom poses a serious risk of violation of the right to privacy enjoyed by every citizen? Does it not consider that the development of electronic commerce, which has greatly reduced transaction costs in Europe, could also be adversely affected?
