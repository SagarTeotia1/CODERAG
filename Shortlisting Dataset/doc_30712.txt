Question for written answer E-005935/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (20 June 2011) Subject: Economic assistance In order to revitalise the economy of countries like Egypt and Tunisia, G8 leaders have pledged USD 40 billion in aid, to be drawn from the IMF, the European Investment Bank and other international financial institutions. In this context, the UK has announced an aid package of USD 175 million over four years for Egypt and Tunisia, while Angela Merkel has said that the European Union will contribute USD 1.3 billion. Given that the goal of this aid is to reinforce democracy and assist economic recovery in these countries, will the Commission say: — Has it considered the possibility that other Arab countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, might also be involved in contributing economic assistance? — Will the economic assistance be given with or without conditionality? What is the Commission's position on using such assistance for the benefit of specific sectors of development? — Given the overwhelmingly high unemployment rate in these countries, has consideration been given, in the context of this international economic assistance, to introducing a technical training system, including a daily allowance and insurance cover for trainees, with a view to speeding up economic recovery and ensuring that this aid package is more effectively used?
