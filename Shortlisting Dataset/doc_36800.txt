Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (25 September 2009) The Commission has not been specifically informed of the situation. Breeding of animals destined to be used in research and testing are covered by EU Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of animals used for experimental and scientific purposes OJ L 358, 18.12.1986. since 1986. Article 15 of the directive provides that all breeding and supplying establishments shall be approved by or registered with, the relevant national authority. In relation to breeding, the directive further describes a number of other obligations concerning the personnel, care, treatment and identification of the animals, as well as guidance as to their housing. Directive 86/609/EEC had to be transposed into national legislation in 1989. The National Authorities competent for this directive are responsible for controlling the correct application of the provisions of the directive. It is important to note that Directive 86/609/EEC is currently under a comprehensive revision. The aim of the revision, presently under co-decision, is to strengthen the legislation and to ensure that the animals still used in experiments will receive appropriate care and humane treatment. The Commission proposal to revise Directive 86/609/EEC contains a number of measures designed to minimise as far as possible the use of non-human primates in scientific procedures, focuses on reporting on developments and increased transparency in this area, significantly improves the housing and care of those still needed to be used and finally requires a thorough case-by-case ethical evaluation and justification for their use for scientific purposes.
