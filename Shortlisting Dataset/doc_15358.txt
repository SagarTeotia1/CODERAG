WRITTEN QUESTION P-3354/04 by Catherine Stihler (PSE) to the Commission (10 December 2004) Subject: EU ban on imports of bovine embryos The Commission Decision 2004/786/EC OJ L 346, 23.11.2004, p. 32 . , which concerns model veterinary certificates for imports of bovine embryos, was published on 23 November 2004 and came into force on 26 November 2004. The decision has caused serious problems for the UK cattle-breeding industry, problems made significantly worse by the lack of any transitional period. Embryos which have already been collected and which are in pre-export quarantine may no longer be eligible for importation, valuable existing contracts cannot now be honoured, and the UK cattle industry will be deprived of essential sources of world-class genetics. The main issue for Member States appears to be IBR (Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis), but the International Embryo Transfer Society has placed the disease in category 1, having concluded that it is not transmissible in embryos if they are trypsin-washed. Will the Commission consider suspending the application of Decision 2004/786/EC pending a full review of EU rules for both trade and imports?
