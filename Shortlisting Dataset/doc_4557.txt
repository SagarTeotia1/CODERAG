Answer given by Ms. Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (30 March 2009) The question repeats a number of elements which the Honourable Member had already raised in his Written Question E‑6224/08 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , and the Commission would wish to refer to its response thereto, which still applies. A new relevant development is the decision of the Czech Presidency to organise a conference on destigmatisation and improving quality of psychiatric care. This event will take place in Prague on 29 May 2009, and it will be organised in cooperation with the Commission and the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe. Measures to build up community based services for people with mental health problems will be one of the key topics of this conference. Moreover, combating poverty and social exclusion of vulnerable groups is one of the priorities of the Open Method of Coordination in the fields of social protection and social inclusion (Social OMC). The social OMC aims at supporting efforts at Member State level towards de-institutionalisation and a shift to community-based care and independent living, thereby building a more inclusive Europe and enabling people with mental health problems to live fulfilling and dignified lives. The Commission also encourages the Member States to make full use of the Structural Funds, and in particular the European Social Fund, to promote de-institutionalisation and quality of psychiatric care.
