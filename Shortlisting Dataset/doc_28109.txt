WRITTEN QUESTION P-4258/07 by Kyösti Virrankoski (ALDE) to the Commission (31 August 2007) Subject: The review of active substances used in plant protection products In 1991, when the current directive (91/414/EEC OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1. ) regarding the placing of plant protection products on the market was adopted, it was agreed that all existing active substances should be evaluated in due course. However, it is noted that the EFSA has not finalised evaluations for substances in the third stage of the review programme for active substances used in plant protection products, even though the legislation states that all evaluations should have been completed by 31 May 2007. Can the Commission confirm that, and can it inform Parliament of the progress made by the EFSA so far? With 15 months left for the completion of the active substances review, it looks very obvious that a profound and careful evaluation is not possible. What does the Commission intend to do? Is a limited extension of the end-of-2008 deadline the only judicious way of taking sensible decisions that ensure good science and keep products available on the market for farmers?
