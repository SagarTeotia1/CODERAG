in the previous 2000 - 2006 Financial Perspective (FP). This often makes direct comparisons between the PDB 2007 and the B2006 figures difficult. Further, the new MFF includes many new programmes. These new programmes sometimes become "umbrella" programmes that cover spending under pre-existing programmes. As in previous budgets, the "Activity-based budgeting" (ABB) approach aims to offer a global view of the cost of the policies. The budget titles, chapters and lines are crucial for the annual budget procedure. However, spending on a given budget chapter, or policy area, can also be spread across a number of Headings.

As a result of these overlapping categories, care must be taken when examining the PDB that comparisons across years and between new and old programmes are "like with like". This working document only presents an overview. Further work will be needed to explain fully the linkages between the PDB 2007, B2006, and the new MFF Headings. 4. Table 1a sets out the commitment appropriations budget for 2007 as per the PDB. The total stands at EUR 126 824 million, which is an increase of 4,6% on B2006, based on a Commission estimate of B2006 appropriations expressed in terms of the new MFF Headings. According to Commission data, the commitments total is equivalent to 1,08% of EU GNI. Annex I to the new Inter-Institutional Agreement (IIA), the Böge report on which was adopted in Plenary on 17 May 2006, sets a ceiling on commitment appropriations of 1,10% of EU GNI. 5. The Commission states in the PDB that the margin remaining within the MFF ceilings is EUR 1 577 million. The margin figures for Heading 4 and for Heading 5 are asterisked (*) in the table because there is an apparent disparity in each case between the commitments, the ceiling and the margin. The margin for Heading 4 does not take into account the appropriations related to the Emergency Aid Reserve of 234,5 million, which is outside of the MFF. The margin under the heading 5 ceiling also includes EUR 76 million from staff contributions to the pension fund.
