Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (18 April 2007) The starting point for the calculation of the 20 % objective in the action plan is the year 2005, for which total primary energy consumption was to be 1 750 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe), based on Eurostat estimates. With a forecast gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the EU of 2.3 % per year, and assuming an unchanged energy intensity between 2005 and 2020, energy consumption would grow by 2.3 % per year, reaching 2 461 Mtoe in 2020. The baseline consumption in 2020 is estimated to be 1 890 Mtoe. This is an increase of around 8 % compared to 2005, or around 0.5 % per year, resulting when no additional energy reduction measures are taken. The difference between 2461 Mtoe mentioned above and the baseline of 1 890 Mtoe (571 Mtoe, or 1.8 % per year) is attributable: (a) to an estimated structural change effect of 0.8 % per year (due in part to the continued increase in the share of the less energy-intensive service sector in the EU economy); and (b) to estimated effects of previous EU policies of 0.35 % per year; and (c) to an autonomous or ‘trend’ effect (due in part to natural replacement of older, worn-out technology with newer technology) of 0.85 % per year. Thus the baseline consumption in 2020 already includes an improvement in energy intensity of 1.8 % per year, before the savings target is applied to it. This means that, with no energy reduction measures, energy consumption would increase from 1 750 Mtoe in 2005 to 1890 Mtoe in 2020, or by 8 %. 3. The 20 % savings objective represents a reduction of the predicted energy consumption levels in 2020 (i.e. 1 890 Mtoe) and not current consumption levels (i.e. 1 750 Mtoe). This reduction results in a level of primary consumption in 2020 of 1 500 Mtoe. The 20 % savings objective is thus calculated on the baseline value of 1 890 Mtoe. This is roughly equal to an annual savings of little less than 1.5 % per year (20 % of 1890 Mtoe is 378 Mtoe). This leads to a total primary energy consumption in 2020 of 1 500 Mtoe. This represents a decrease in energy consumption by roughly 14 % compared with current (2005) energy consumption. An absolute savings target has been set in Directive 2006/32/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy services Directive 2006/32/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC, OJ L 114, 27.4.2006. . This is a 9 % savings target to be measured and verified by the ninth year of application (1 January 2008 to 31 December 2016). It is calculated by each Member State individually, on the basis of its annual final (i.e. end-use) energy consumption, using an average of the most recent five-year period previous to the implementation of the directive. In order to achieve a 20 % reduction from current
