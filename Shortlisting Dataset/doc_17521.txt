endemic problem of "outstanding commitments". Parliament still awaits information from the Commission as to what payments can still be made under the Structural Funds and what funding will be lost. The problem of the outstanding commitments is dealt with in a separate report by Gianni PITTELLA (PES, I), which will also be voted on in Strasbourg at the October session. SMEs are the rapporteur's main priority in internal policy (Heading 3). Efforts must be made to improve the financial environment for SMEs in the accession countries. MEPs are also worried about the EU information offices known as "Info Points" - several of which are due to close on 1 January 2004. The Commission is asked to take immediate steps to find a solution that would enable the Info Points to continue operating. External action (Heading 4) remains a source of tension. The resolution says that funding for reconstruction in Iraq must reflect the needs of the Iraqi people and be provided in the context of a political agreement under United Nations auspices. Parliament and the Council failed to reach agreement on this point at their trialogue on 7 October. MEPs also believe that previous priorities (Afghanistan, measures to fight poverty and AIDS) must not suffer as a result of constraints caused by the need to fund new areas of concern. Turning to administrative expenditure (Heading 5), the Budgets Committee wants the funding earmarked for 272 new posts at the Commission to be placed in the reserve. These funds will be released only when guarantees are provided that all the posts will be filled and that they will be used entirely to recruit staff from the accession countries. Another condition is that planned pilot projects and preparatory measures should be carried out. Parliament has pushed strongly for these measures but so far the Commission has neglected them. "Other sections" of the 2004 Budget As regards "Other Sections" of the budget (report by Neena GILL) , in view of the large increase in expenditure on buildings for the EU institutions expected from 2007 onwards, the Budgets Committee insists that the margins under Heading 5 be used to finance this expenditure in advance and thereby relieve pressure in future.
