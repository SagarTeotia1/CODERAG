Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (13 December 2010) The Commission is in the process of assessing the possible impact of the contemplated measures and finalising the modalities of the new proposals. The outcome of the European Quantitative Impact Study carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors throughout 2010 represents an invaluable input in these context. A summary of the outcome of the public consultation mentioned by the Honourable Member can be found in Annex XII p. 96-97. of the Commission's staff working document ‘Possible further changes to the Capital Requirements Directive’ http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/docs/2010/crd4/consultation_paper_en.pdf published on 26 February 2010. It is not the Commission's intention to hamper mortgage markets or access to loans for the purchase of housing. However, it has to be ensured that banks hold appropriate levels of capital against the exposures they incur from these types of lending. Currently, the Commission does not intend to grant any exemptions or waivers from the capital requierements for mortgage lending. Mortgages for residential housing and first-time buyers entail risks and thus have to be backed by an appropriate level of capital. It should however be noted that the general possibility to apply a preferential treatment and thus hold a lower level of capital is likely to be maintained in the directive, provided that all the conditions are met The recent agreement on capital requirements for banks (‘Basel III’), as agreed by Heads of States and Governments at the recent G20-meeting, does not amend the existing Basel framework related to mortgage lending. However, the measures proposed in the context of the Basel III package will significantly contribute to the efforts to strengthen the stability of the banking sector and the financial system as a whole. The Commission expects to adopt a legislative proposal amending the Capital Requirements Directive Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (recast) OJ L 177, 30.6.2006, p. 1–200/ OJ L 239M , 10.9.2010 & Directive 2006/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (recast) OJ L 177, 30.6.2006, p. 201–255/ OJ L 239M , 10.9.2010, p. 201–255. (so called CRDIV), including proposals related to the treatment of mortgage lending, before summer 2011. Within the same timeframe, the Commission plans also to adopt a legislative proposal on responsible lending whose objective is to provide a high level of consumer protection for borrowers, including first-time buyers, and to contribute to the emergence of a better integrated and more competitive mortgage market at EU level. This proposal is not likely to result in any significant changes for the social groups mentioned by the Honourable Member.
