Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (7 April 2011) EU competition law applies to anticompetitive behaviour by undertakings (e.g. in the form of anticompetitive agreements pursuant to Article 101 TFEU or in the form of abuses of dominant positions pursuant to Article 102 TFEU). In addition, the competition rules apply with regard to the granting of aid by a Member State or through state resources (Article 107 TFEU). In itself, the right of self-determination and its consequences for the rights of employees does not constitute anticompetitive behaviour by the undertakings concerned. What is more, nothing in the information provided suggests that any advantage enjoyed by those undertakings as a result of that right of self-determination involves a transfer of state resources for the purposes of EU state aid rules. Consequently, the right of self-determination does not appear to run counter to the competition rules of the EU.
