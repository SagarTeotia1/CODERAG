ORAL QUESTION H-0218/04 for Question Time at the part-session in September 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Bart Staes to the Commission Subject: Liberalisation of port services - current situation Some time ago, concern arose in port circles when it became known that the Commission was planning to submit a new proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services even before the inauguration of the new Commission. As is well-known, the European Parliament rejected the proposed compromise at third reading (conciliation procedure) during the last parliamentary term. Can the Commission indicate what plans it has for submitting a new proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services, and can it already say what the substance of these plans will be?
