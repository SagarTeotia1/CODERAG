WRITTEN QUESTION E-1675/09 by Emmanouil Angelakas (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (17 March 2009) Subject: Support for some European economic sectors The Commission has announced a programme to support the European automobile industry with Community funds in excess of EUR 12 billion which will be launched in March 2009. A support programme for the financial system is already under way in most Member States aimed at channelling money into the market to support SMEs and to limit job losses. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Apart from the above economic sectors, does it intend to make equivalent targeted payments to other sectors of the economy? If so which ones? 2. Particularly as regards the shipping and tourism sectors which have also been affected by the crisis, does a plan exist to support them? If so, through what specific measures?
