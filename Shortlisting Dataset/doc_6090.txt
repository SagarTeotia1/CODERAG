ORAL QUESTION H-0817/06 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Glenys Kinnock to the Commission Subject: Development dimension of EPAs Would the Commission agree that the core of any development dimension to the EPA negotiations should not merely involve enhanced market access for traditional exports from ACP countries, but should also help them implement policies aimed at transforming their economies, diversifying production and ensuring value-added economic activity? If the Commission agrees, how does it respond to ACP criticism of the Commission's failure to be prepared to help them adjust to the loss of revenue resulting from the removal of customs tariffs and to other restructuring costs?
