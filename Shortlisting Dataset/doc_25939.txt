WRITTEN QUESTION E-5265/09 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (26 October 2009) Subject: Labelling products from sustainable fisheries The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) has grown to become the largest sustainable fisheries certification body in the world. Currently it certifies 7 % of the world’s fisheries, a proportion shortly expected to increase to more than 10 %. Its practices are said to be amongst the most rigorous of any organisation that issues an ‘eco-label’. In drafting proposals for its own introduction of a Council Regulation setting minimum criteria for labelling sustainable fishery products, how will the Commission ensure that duplication with the MSC’s work is avoided and certification standards are not undermined?
