Question for written answer E-006308/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (30 June 2011) Subject: Tax secrecy in state aid cases Effective controls on state aid are paramount in order to ensure fair competition within the internal market. Apparently, certain Member States claim that national rules on tax secrecy could limit disclosure of tax measures potentially containing state aid both to the European Commission and to plaintiffs. One recent example is a case where the German undertaking HP Pelzer received state aid inter alia in the form of a very substantial tax reduction. I therefore wish to ask the Commission: 1. Is it legally possible for a Member State to refuse disclosure of information on state aid measures (tax rebates, tax reductions, etc.) based on the protection of tax secrecy? 2. In the affirmative, how does the Commission ensure that the principle of tax secrecy is not abused to hide illegal state aid measures? 3. If Member States may not claim tax secrecy in state aid cases, how does the Commission proceed in cases where Member States refuse to provide information on tax‑related state aid measures based on the principle of tax secrecy?
