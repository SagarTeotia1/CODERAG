WRITTEN QUESTION E-0479/06 by Mary McDonald (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 February 2006) Subject: Workers and trade union rights In November of last year in my constituency in Dublin a worker in a Dunnes Stores’ outlet was sacked for wearing a badge representing her trade union, ‘Mandate’. Furthermore, the management of the company refused to meet her to discuss her dismissal if she chose to be accompanied by her union representative. Does the Commission believe that all workers have the right to work free from threat of dismissal or harassment for identifying themselves as trade union members? Does the Commission accept that all workers in the EU should be entitled to union representation during discussions with management, especially if the worker believes he/she has been treated unfairly by the management? This issue has been raised internationally; will the Commission take this opportunity to join those in Ireland and throughout Europe who believe the management’s behaviour to have been wholly unfair and unacceptable?
