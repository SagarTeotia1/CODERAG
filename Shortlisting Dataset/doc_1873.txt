Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (3 October 2008) The Single Status Agreement, as the Honourable Member points out, is a collective agreement made between local government in the United Kingdom and trade unions in order to streamline all pay scales applicable in local administration into one. Such collective agreements are not notified to the Commission as no provision is made for their compatibility with Community law to be subject to systematic Commission scrutiny. According to Article 23 of Directive 2006/54/EC OJ L 204, 26.7.2006. , Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment in individual or collective contracts or agreements (…) shall be, or may be, declared null and void or be amended. Member States are responsible for ensuring the correct and effective implementation of Community legislation into their national legal order. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission closely monitors the implementation of Community law at national level and takes the necessary measures as provided for by the EC Treaty, should Member States be found in breach of Community law. The Commission has no information indicating the existence of a breach of Community law. At the same time, it is open to any individual to initiate legal proceedings, as provided for in the national law, to contest any possible offences before the national courts.
