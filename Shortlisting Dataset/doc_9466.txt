Question for written answer E-3651/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) (25 May 2010) Subject: Secret prison at a US military base in Afghanistan The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reports that there is sufficient evidence to confirm the existence of an illegal US prison in Afghanistan, known as the ‘black jail’, at the Bagram military base to the north of Kabul. The Red Cross points out that this is a separate prison from the detention centre on the base, since the US authorities have been notifying the names of people held in a different complex that does not correspond to the Bagram facility. Nine former prisoners at this site have made statements describing how they were tortured and held in freezing cold rooms where they were deprived of sleep and where the light was kept on all night. Is the Commission aware of the existence of this secret prison in Afghanistan? What is the Commission's attitude to illegal US prisons in third countries, where detainees are systematically tortured? Given that the European Union attaches particular importance to protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and given that one of the common goals in relations between the EU and the United States is respect for human rights and individual liberty, as stated in the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration, what steps has the Commission taken to urge the United States to respect human rights and international law, with particular regard to the situation of prisoners? Will the Commission request information from the United States on the secret prison at Bagram? Will it raise this issue in the context of relations with the United States?
