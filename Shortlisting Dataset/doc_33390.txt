Answer given by Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (11 May 2011) The Commission has allocated EUR 22 million to fight the cholera epidemic by implementing the following strategy: — save lives through adequate healthcare in cholera treatment centres and units, oral rehydration points, training of health staff, provision of medical items, etc.; — limit the spread of the disease through the improvement of access to safe water and sanitation and the dissemination of key hygiene messages; — enhance the preparation of the population to the disease through the distribution of chlorine and adequate hygiene items while training the population to recognise the symptoms and prepare oral rehydration solutions; — support epidemiological surveillance. It also mobilised the European Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate in-kind donations from Member States and worked with the European Centre for Disease Control to assess the situation and develop strategic orientations. The Commission has done its best to finance projects in all the regions of the country, both in the health and water/sanitation/hygiene sector, sometimes asking partners to go and work in a particular region in order to cover as much as possible the whole territory, in coordination with other actors. The projects implemented by our partners, once the peak of the epidemic has passed, have been reoriented to reduce the response part and enhance the preparation of communities, especially in remote rural areas. Local health workers have been trained to go to communities and deliver key hygiene messages, train the people to identify the symptoms of the disease and react quickly and adequately in order to save lives. Hygiene items and buckets with chlorine are also being distributed. Cholera is now endemic in Haiti and it will be taken in consideration in all the projects financed by the Commission in 2011. The 2011 indicative budget for Haiti is EUR 33 million.
