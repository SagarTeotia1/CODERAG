Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (16 June 2011) There is presently no specific EU legislative framework for funding organisation of animal protection. In addition, issues like the treatment of abandoned animals or shelters for animals are not a matter presently under EU competencies. Despite that the Commission considers the protection of animals a priority and has recently supported initiatives highlighting the concept of responsible animal ownership such the ones mentioned in the written question. Under rural development, support is granted to farmers who voluntarily make animal welfare commitments going beyond the mandatory standards. The Rural Development Programme (RDP) for Galicia contains actions supporting animal welfare. Specifically, EUR 495 752 from EAFRD are currently devoted to animal welfare issues. Actions provided for in the RDP are farmers' engagements in relation to open yard poultry farming and outdoor porcine breeding and fattening. The Commission is presently preparing a future EU strategy for the protection and welfare of animals 2011‑15. In this context the Commission will consider options for improving the welfare of animals within the limit of the competences conferred by the Treaties.
