Question for written answer E-001032/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ioan Enciu (S&D) (10 February 2011) Subject: Protecting the rights of persons with disabilities On 5 January 2011 the EU ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The aim of this convention is to ensure that persons with disabilities can enjoy the same rights as all other citizens, by laying down minimum mandatory standards in the areas of civil, political, social and economic rights. Nonetheless, certain Member States are promoting measures and laws which constitute severe attacks on the interests and dignity of persons with disabilities. A case in point here is the modification by the Romanian government of Law 448/2006, which represents a frontal attack, flying in the face of European and international norms, on the rights of those with disabilities. In the light of the above, can the Commission state what measures it will propose with a view to ensuring that all Member States respect the rights of persons with disabilities pursuant to the European and international provisions? What, in this connection, are the concrete results in implementation terms of the Disability Action Plan for 2003‑10, and how will the Commission implement the European Disability Strategy for 2010‑2020?
