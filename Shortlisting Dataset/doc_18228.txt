Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (18 August 2011) The three European Supervisory Authorites (ESAs), that is the European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority are fully operational. They initiated their work on 1 January 2011 and are performing their tasks as set out in the establishing Regulations (Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12–47; Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 48–83; Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84–119). . The management structures provided for by the establishing Regulations have been constituted and Chairpersons and Executive Directors have been appointed as foreseen in the regulations. Budget and staff arrangements are in place. It should be noted, however, that certain functions foreseen in the establishing Regulations require specifications in the relevant sectoral legislation before they can be performed by the Authorities (for example in relation to consumer protection in accordance with Article 9(5)). The regulations establishing the European Supervisory Authorities provide for a review of their functioning by 1 January 2014. The Commission will carry out a full assessment of their performance as part of that review.
