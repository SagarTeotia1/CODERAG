Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (19 April 2011) The Commission wishes to point out that Directive 2008/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on road infrastructure safety management OJ L 319, 29.11.2008, p. 59. had to be transposed by the Member States by 19 December 2010. Consequently there is currently little experience available to evaluate whether the directive should be amended. Nonetheless, the Commission will examine, in the framework of the implementation of the policy orientations on road safety 2011-20 COM(2010)389 final. , the ways to extend the relevant principles of safe management of infrastructure to the secondary road network of Member States.
