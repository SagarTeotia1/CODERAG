Draws attention to the Court of Auditors’ confirmation that the annual accounts for a budget of EUR 18.3 million fairly present the Centre’s actual financial position as at 31 December 2008 and that the Centre’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 2008 are in accordance with its financial rules; 2. Expresses its satisfaction that the Court of Auditors has declared the Centre’s annual accounts for the financial year 2008 to be legal and regular; 3. Calls on the Centre, in the light of the carry-over of 25% of appropriations for project-related payments, to improve its financial planning and draw up a more accurate budget; 4. Welcomes the improvements in connection with the monitoring of projects and the award of contracts; expects the relevant details to be set out in the activity report; 5. Expresses dissatisfaction at the standstill in the area of staff management, given that the objectives for staff and the performance indicators were neither measureable nor geared to results; expects progress in this area of fundamental importance to the Centre's work and asks to be kept informed; 6. Points out that the Centre employs 128 staff and in 2009 introduced a performance measurement system; expects to be informed of the results of the introduction of that system; 7. Welcomes, given the two agencies' related areas of responsibility, the close cooperation and the synergies established between the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training and the European Training Foundation (ETF); calls on the two agencies to include a detailed follow-up report on the cooperation agreement in their 2009 activity reports.
