progress has been satisfactory so far, the target at (Deputy) Director-General level has not yet been reached for six new Member States (Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania). Therefore, two posts at (Deputy) Director-General level which are about to be published are already targeting only these six nationalities and the Member of the Commission in charge of Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-Fraud will shortly present to the College a proposal for publication of some more vacancies at (Deputy) Director-General level reserved for citizens from those new Member States that will not yet have achieved their targets by then. Due consideration will also be given to this aspect in the context of the annual mobility exercise for Senior Management at the Commission in order to identify possible vacancies to be reserved for nationalities short of their (Deputy) Director-General target. The above figures and the actions undertaken in this respect show clearly that the Commission remains fully committed to reaching the indicative management recruitment targets it has set itself in the context of the EU‑10 and EU‑2 enlargements, in full respect of the decisions taken by the Council.
