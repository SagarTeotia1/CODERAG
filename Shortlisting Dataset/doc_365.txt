Question for written answer E-3833/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Wojciech Michał Olejniczak (S&D) (1 June 2010) Subject: Cohesion checks The goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy include creating more innovative economies in Member States, raising the level of funding for the R&D sector to 3% of GDP, creating jobs in order to achieve an employment rate of 75%, increasing the number of young people completing tertiary education to at least 40%, and reducing the number of early school‑leavers to 10%. They are all praiseworthy. The strategy also assumes the attainment of very ambitious goals connected with a low‑carbon economy. These goals are self-evident for all, and I think that every European would support them, especially in today's economic climate. The process of analysis that the strategy paper has undergone cautions the Commission against repeating the mistakes made during the equally ambitious Lisbon Strategy. The lack of cohesion between the strategy as defined at European Union level and the strategy as implemented by individual Member States was a key cause of the Lisbon Strategy's failure. In this connection, what steps does the Commission intend to take to avoid making the same mistakes, and what policy will it adopt on checking cohesion and Community actions across the whole European Union?
