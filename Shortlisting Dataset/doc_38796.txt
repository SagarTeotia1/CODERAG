Question for written answer E-001566/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Janusz Wojciechowski (ECR) , Zbigniew Ziobro (ECR) and Jacek Włosowicz (ECR) (23 February 2011) Subject: Certification of firms exporting goods to non-EU countries We know of a number of cases in which non-EU countries — namely Russia and China — have required Polish firms exporting goods to their markets to undergo a certification procedure. Is this certification procedure universally applied to all EU firms, or are the Polish firms referred to above merely isolated cases? Does the EU as a whole (or do individual Member States) require Russian and Chinese firms exporting goods to the EU market to undergo a certification procedure? If so, which countries and which goods are affected?
