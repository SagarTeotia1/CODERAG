ORAL QUESTION H-0996/05 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jonas Sjöstedt to the Commission Subject: Gender and trade The sixth ministerial meeting of the WTO is to open in Hong Kong in mid-December. Decisions are to be taken on major issues and the EU is one of the players investing a great deal of energy to make the meeting a success. The hope is that it will be possible to conclude the negotiating round begun in Doha in 2001 during the coming year. If achieved, it will be of great significance for countries throughout the world, both north and south, as well as for relations between men and women, particularly in the developing countries, irrespective of the topic concerned, e.g. agriculture, NAMA or trade in services. Different structures mean that men and women have varying roles and responsibilities in economies. International trade flows, production patterns and rules and regulations therefore affect men and women in different ways. The Doha Round was meant to be about development. However, a trade policy and a possible outcome to negotiations which do not acknowledge the different impact on men of women of various decisions are in danger of reinforcing an unequal distribution of power where men are systematically favoured at the expense of women. Does the Commission share the view that the liberalisation of trade has different repercussions for men and women and how has the Commission taken account of the gender perspective in the current WTO negotiations?
