petrol level of €359/1000 litres by 2015 rather than 2012. Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania should have until 2016 to reach the target. On the other hand, contrary to the Commission proposal, MEPs said Spain, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal and Greece did not need a transitional period. No to further rises Furthermore, the committee opposes the Commission’s plan to increase both minimum rates to €380/1000 litres in 2014. In addition, still with a view to avoiding divergence between tax rates getting worse, MEPs say those countries with current tax rates over €400/1000 litres on diesel and €500/1000 litres on unleaded petrol should not increase their taxes further until 2015. As usual with taxation matters, Parliament’s role is consultative. Once the plenary has voted, the final decision is for the Council, which can act only if it can reach unanimity. Impact on UK and Ireland In the UK, current tax levels are well above the minimum EU levels, and this would still be true after the increases proposed by the Commission, so these changes would have little practical impact. If the Council were to adopt MEPs’ proposal of a moratorium on further rises, this would affect the UK. The increases proposed by MEPs would make little difference in Ireland for the same reason, but an increase would be needed in the tax on diesel to if this was to reach the Commission’s goal of €380/1000 litres (the current rate is €368/1000 litres).

The common position was reached after negotiations with the Parliaments' rapporteur Reino Paasilinna (PES, FI), who was satisfied with the compromise, which took on board most of the points raised by Parliament in first reading. The European Parliament voted by a large majority against an amendment to reject the Council Common Position from the Greens/EFA group. "The agreement with Council represents a success for Parliament", said Mr Paasilinna, adding that "the compromise stresses the role of innovation. Innovation is where we really have to catch up: too often, our brilliant students and researchers do not reap the rewards of their work simply because there is no one to help them turn research results into commercial products." "Knowledge and Innovation Communities" of universities, research organisations and businesses The EIT will have a two-tier structure, in which a Governing Board selects higher education institutions, research organisations, companies and other stakeholders to form autonomous partnerships called "Knowledge and Innovation Communities" (KICs). Every KIC should consist of at least three partner
