Reply (14 February 2011) In March 2004, in the light of the terrorist attacks in Madrid, the European Council adopted a Declaration on combating terrorism 7906/04 JAI 100 Ecofin 107 TRANS 145 RELEX 123 ECO 73 PESC 208 COTER 20 COSDP 142, No 5, p. 7. , inviting the Commission to explore the creation of synergies between existing and future information systems (SIS II, VIS and Eurodac) in order to exploit their added value in the prevention of and fight against terrorism, and to bring forward proposals to enable national law enforcement agencies to have access to EU systems. In June 2007, the Council adopted conclusions on access to Eurodac by Member States' police and law enforcement authorities as well as Europol 11004/07 ENFOPOL 123 EURODAC 7. . In these conclusions the Council considered that, in order to fully achieve the aim of improving security and to enhance the fight against terrorism, access under certain conditions to Eurodac, for the purpose of consultation, should be granted to Member States' police and law enforcement authorities as well as to Europol in the course of their duties in relation to the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. The Council also invited the Commission to present a proposal designed to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 of 11 December 2000 concerning the establishment of ‘Eurodac’ for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (OJ L 316, 15.12.2000, p. 1). on Eurodac in order to enable Member States' police and law enforcement authorities as well as Europol to have access to Eurodac. Concerning the protection of personal data, in the abovementioned conclusions the Council stressed that any access to Eurodac should be subject to strict compliance with the rules governing the protection of personal data. Subsequently, on 10 September 2009, the Commission submitted an amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the establishment of ‘EURODAC’ COM(2009)342 final. , together with a proposal for a Council Decision on requesting comparisons with EURODAC data by Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol for law enforcement purposes. COM(2009)344 final. However, as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, these proposals could not be pursued in the form in which they had been presented. Therefore, the Commission has replaced them with a new proposal COM(2010)555 final. which does not include provisions referring to the access of law enforcement authorities to Eurodac, with a view to accelerating the negotiations on the asylum package and facilitating an early agreement on the Eurodac Regulation. However, in a common statement by the delegations of Belgium, Hungary, Poland, Denmark and Cyprus 17223/10 ASIM 120. submitted to the Council on 2 December 2010, it was noted that ‘most Member States stated their will to allow law enforcement agencies to have access to the Eurodac database under very strict rules to strengthen security’. During the Council meeting on 2 December 2010, the Commission took note of this position and
