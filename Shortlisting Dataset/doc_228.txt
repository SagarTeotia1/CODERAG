Parliament accepted a Declaration on the financial provisions . III. Conclusion The EP delegation decided to negotiate the four legislative files as a package. This approach led to considerable improvements. The overall package reached at the end of the conciliation procedure will improve the Parliament's position on delegated acts in the upcoming instruments. In the spirit of compromise the delegation recommends to maintain the package approach, and that the Parliament approves the joint text at third reading.
