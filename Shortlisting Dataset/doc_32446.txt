Question for written answer E-9262/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (9 November 2010) Subject: Turkish embargo on Cypriot airline flights During the recent strike by air-traffic controllers in Greece, international airlines operating in the region were compelled to alter their routes to avoid Greek airspace. Most airlines used Turkish airspace but Turkey quickly and categorically rejected Cypriot airlines' request to use its airspace, thereby violating international aviation law and causing Cypriot airlines enormous losses, the obvious political objective being a refusal to recognise the Republic of Cyprus. 1. What measures will the Commission take in response to the fact that Cyprus faces particular problems with air links to Europe owing to the Turkish embargo on Cypriot aircraft overflying Turkey? 2. Will the Commission ask Eurocontrol to look into alternative flight plans which will also include Turkish airspace?
