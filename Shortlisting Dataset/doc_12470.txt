WRITTEN QUESTION E-1117/08 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (5 March 2008) Subject: Abolition of the death penalty worldwide On 26 April 2007 the European Parliament adopted resolution ( P6_TA-PROV(2007)0166 ) on the initiative for a universal moratorium on the death penalty, describing a moratorium as ‘a strategic move towards the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances’. On 18 June 2007 the External Affairs Council of the EU decided that the EU would introduce, in the framework of a cross-regional alliance, a resolution against the death penalty at the 62nd UN General Assembly in September 2007. On 19 June the Commission announced it was proposing a draft joint declaration to the EP and to the Council to be adopted together with the Council on the establishment of a European Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October each year. Could the Commission outline what action it is taking in response to paragraph 5 of Parliament's April 2007 resolution which called on it to ‘take every possible opportunity to support the establishment of regional abolitionist coalitions’?
