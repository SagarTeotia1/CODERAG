diseases continue to spread, despite existing efforts, B. whereas the increasing threat to social and economic development of people in developing countries posed by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria requires, in addition to existing efforts, a prompt, effective and comprehensive response at both national and international level, C. whereas international mobilisation and the introduction of a global scheme geared to facilitating access to treatment for these diseases in developing countries must therefore involve a considerable increase in the financial resources earmarked for combating communicable diseases and improving health systems in the countries of the South, D. whereas the inability to obtain treatment through lack of access to medicines and social exclusion, especially of women, disables the workforce and increases poverty, which may lead to instability in some developing countries, E. whereas the cutting the price of drugs is a key issue to be considered in creating a global and transparent scheme for access to treatment, particularly for AIDS; whereas recent developments have shown that prices can be radically reduced, confirming therefore that price is a barrier to access to essential and generic medicines which can be overcome; whereas access to effective drugs and treatment is further hindered by obstacles such as the capacity and budget of health systems, quality of medical follow-up, etc., F. whereas the right to health of thousands of people hit by epidemics in developing countries prevails over the right to the commercial exploitation of patents connected to these scourges, particularly given that research spending can be recouped from the sale of drugs in developed countries; whereas the exploitation of patents on drugs in general has only been permitted for a few decades and limits should now be clearly set, G. whereas treatments are often not available due to a lack of appropriate research and consequent production of drugs on grounds of commercial profitability, H. whereas setting the price of potentially life-saving drugs cannot be left entirely to the judgement of pharmaceutical companies, I. welcoming the fact that, in the case of South Africa, an agreement was reached between the Republic of South Africa and the pharmaceutical industries, J. whereas the 35 million AIDS sufferers in developing countries are condemned to die if they do not have access to treatment, K. whereas although the fight against these three communicable diseases could be brought together in a single Community action programme, it is nevertheless necessary to clearly distinguish the specific problems posed by each of these diseases and, consequently, to differentiate between the measures to be taken in each case, L. whereas the recent resurgence of tuberculosis, which had been partly eradicated, is chiefly the result of poor sanitary conditions and poor living conditions in general, in addition to the comparative ineffectiveness of the BCG vaccination; whereas even if drugs are affordable, in the form of generic drugs, long-term treatment requires lengthy and intensive medical follow-up which health structures in developing countries are incapable of providing; whereas resistance to available drugs increases in such conditions, since they are not used correctly; whereas new impetus should therefore be given to research into
