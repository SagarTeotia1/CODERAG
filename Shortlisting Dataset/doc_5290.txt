WRITTEN QUESTION E-2069/06 by Marie-Noëlle Lienemann (PSE) to the Commission (12 May 2006) Subject: Observance of the rules of free competition Has the Commission looked at potential European measures to prevent food products being included in health insurance reimbursements? Does the Commission consider that the rules of free competition permit an insurer to join forces with an agri-food manufacturer to reimburse certain products of theirs on the grounds that consumption of them is beneficial to health? Partnerships between the large Dutch insurance firm VGZ and Becel (belonging to the Dutch Unilever Group), between the insurance company MAAF and Unilever, and between the French insurer AGF and Danone have just been revealed. The products in question are presented as having anti-cholesterol properties and are to be reimbursed for at least three months. This sort of measure tends to take the place of medical treatment and the promotion of a better diet. Does the Commission consider these practices to be in keeping with the spirit and provisions of Community law?
