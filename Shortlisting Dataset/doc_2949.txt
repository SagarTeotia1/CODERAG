Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (16 July 2010) From the very beginning of the financial and economic crisis the Commission took or proposed a number of measures to provide the Member States a helping hand in order to overcome the negative effects of the economic downturn. In line with the European Economic Recovery Package, the legal framework governing the grant of assistance under the Structural Funds has been modified Council Regulation (EC) No 284/2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, OJ L94 of 8.4.2009; Regulation (EC) No 397/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1080/2009, OJ L 126 of 21.5.2009 ; Commission Regulation (EC) No 846/2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006, OJ L 250 of 23.9.2009 . . Subsequently, in order to increase the impact of EU funding on the national economies and labour markets, the general regulation for cohesion policy (Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006) was further amended and the new regulation entered into force by 25 June 2010 Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, OJ L 210, 31.7.2006 , finally amended by Regulation (EC) N°539/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2010, OJ L 158, 24.6.2010 . following throughout discussions and approval in the European Parliament in the Council. The overriding aim is to speed up implementation of the cohesion programmes and to accelerate provision of financing to beneficiaries. This modification will have a positive impact on the speed of implementation of programmes. It involves substantial measures to simplify the rules and procedures for cohesion policy combined with limited and targeted financial measures. For example, it will be possible for national authorities to adopt more high value environmental projects on national or regional level without a need for a Commission decision and the use of financial engineering instruments will be extended to energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in the buildings’ sector including existing housing. The new measures will allow adapting the programmes faster to new situations and context. The package includes financial elements which aim at releasing the burden on public budgets in the Member States, thereby addressing the problems of absorption of the funds. Concretely, for programmes supported in Greece and in other Member States, more flexibility will be provided for the spending of the amounts allocated in 2007 and the protection of major projects against the automatic de-commitment risk will be extended. All these measures, both as regards the simplification and the financial management, reinforce the role of cohesion policy as an instrument in the situation where public resources are scarce and where private investors are more reluctant to take risks. The amendment concerns all the Funds (European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund and European Social Fund). In addition to the abovementioned legislative amendments, the Commission works closely with the Member States to adapt the operational programmes, where justified, to the new challenges and assists the
