Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2009) From the beginning of the Gaza crisis the Commission has concentrated all its energy, contacts and discussions with Israel on the best way to deal with the emergency, and in particular access and provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza. At the present time, the priority in the relations with Israel remains focused on Gaza and in particular the issue of access and provision of humanitarian aid. For all of these matters, dialogue with Israel is essential. The Commission considers it vital, particularly in a crisis, to keep all channels of diplomatic and political contact open. Suspending relations with one partner is likely to negatively affect the EU’s influence in the region.
