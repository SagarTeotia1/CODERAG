Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (28 January 2005) The EU conducts a regular bilateral dialogue with China on human rights. In this framework, it has always addressed the safeguard of the rights of the minorities, especially in Tibet. It has, more particularly, constantly urged the Chinese authorities to preserve the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. In the context of this dialogue the EU has regularly brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities in every session, and more recently in Beijing on 24 September 2004, the situation of individuals who have been sentenced for having expressed their opinion or their belief. One such case is that of Tenzing Deleg Rinpoche. Earlier in 2004, the EU had already made an official demarche in Beijing at ambassadorial level to request information on his whereabouts and state of health, to express the hope that the death sentence will not be upheld and to ask for judicial review of the case. More recently, on 25 November 2004, the EU Troika carried out in Beijing a new ad hoc demarche during which the case of Tenzin Rinpoche Deleg was again addressed. The EU is fully committed to continue urging China not to carry out the sentence and is prepared to contribute, in this respect, to finding an acceptable solution to the case under examination.
