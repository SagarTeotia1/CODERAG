ORAL QUESTION H-0083/06 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Anne Jensen to the Commission Subject: Introduction of digital tachographs The chaotic run-in to the introduction of digital tachographs, which has been postponed several times, has been described by the industry as a farce. Can the Commission guarantee that digital tachographs and the software required to read and check the data recorded on them will be brought into line with the new rules on driving and rest periods when they enter into force at the beginning of 2007? Can the Commission also give an assurance that it will take action in good time if problems should prove to arise?
