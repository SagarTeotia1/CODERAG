Question for written answer E-003367/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Claude Moraes (S&D) (11 April 2011) Subject: Dolphin captivity across the EU There are currently over 36 dolphinariums within the EU, despite adverse public opinion and extensive scientific research into the harmful effects of captivity on dolphins. Recently, huge publicity in relation to the ‘Cove’ in Japan has aroused international concern for dolphins and spurred on efforts to protect them from cruelty and captivity. Regarding trade, the use of dolphins in zoos and dolphinariums is currently regulated under the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations (EC) No 338/97 and (EC) No 865/2006. Under EU legislation, dolphins from the wild cannot be used for primarily commercial purposes and trade in dolphins within the EU can only take place once the scientific authorities in the Member States have established that this are for the intention for breeding, scientific research or educational purposes only. Given the commercial nature of dolphinariums across the EU, is the Commission satisfied that no breaches of the current EU wildlife trade legislation are taking place? Does the Commission intend to examine the conditions of European dolphinariums and, if necessary, take legal action against any Member States should they not be adhering to current legislation?
