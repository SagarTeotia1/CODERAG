The purpose of the regulation is to bring together the basic concepts underlying the new security-management concept for the EU's external borders, such as a harmonised system for risk assessment. Parliament agreed with the Commission proposal that it was necessary to establish an equivalent level of protection in customs controls on goods brought into the Community. In order to achieve this objective the establishment of an equivalent level of customs control in the Community is necessary, as is the guarantee of a harmonised application of customs controls by the Member States. The House was in agreement with the Commission proposal regarding the fact that all information, which is by nature confidential, should be covered by the obligations of professional secrecy. The Commission proposal included a provision stating that customs, fiscal and other competent authorities may communicate data received in the context of importation or exportation of goods between themselves, Member States and the Commission, where this is required in order to protect the security of citizens and businesses, or to detect or prevent irregularities. MEPs, however, voted to delete this point. Parliament also adopted an amendment, which adds that customs controls for the purpose of the correct application of Community legislation may be carried out in a third country where an international agreement provides for this. Where controls are performed by authorities other than customs authorities, MEPs felt that such controls should be performed in close co-ordination with the customs authorities. Concerning the communication of confidential data to the customs and other administrations of third countries, the House voted in favour of an amendment stating that is would only be allowed in the framework of an international agreement, provided that the date protection provisions in force are respected. Parliament further decided to amend the Commission proposal to add that customs authorities may carry out all of the controls they deem necessary to ensure that customs rules and other legislation governing the international movement of goods are correctly applied.
