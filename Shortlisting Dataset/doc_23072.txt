WRITTEN QUESTION E-2034/05 by Christine De Veyrac (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 June 2005) Subject: Doha — trade negotiations The Doha round of trade negotiations is currently being discussed at the World Trade Organisation. The European Commission will be representing the interests of the Union there. The general public is still wary of talks that they consider — wrongly or rightly — to be lacking in transparency. In light of this, could the Commission clarify what progress has been made in the current negotiations, particularly with regard to agricultural trade, trade in services (including the audiovisual sector) and in the health sector?
