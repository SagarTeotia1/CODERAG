the supply chain is long and highly complex, comprising many intermediaries, Price volatility, farmers' income, aid to developing countries J. whereas fluctuations in commodity prices may become a more pronounced and regular feature of the global market; whereas higher food prices do not automatically translate into higher farm incomes, mainly due to the speed at which farm-input costs increase and the growing divergence between producer and consumer prices; whereas the share of farmers' income from the food supply chain has substantially dropped, while the profits of processors and retailers have constantly increased; whereas consumer prices have increased; and whereas at least 30% of all food produced globally is wasted at different points along the food chain, K. whereas the share of aid to the developing world going to agriculture and rural development has fallen dramatically over the past three decades; whereas investment in sustainable food systems in developing countries has declined due to a shift in priorities for export-oriented production, further weakening local capacities to produce and distribute sufficient food at fair prices; whereas many developing countries are not realising their food production potential; whereas a serious obstacle to increased agricultural output in developing countries is that small farmers often lack access to microcredit for investment, sometimes owing to the fact that they do not own the land, L. whereas large tracts of land, particularly in the developing world, have been purchased by international companies, frequently without the consent of the landholders; whereas this land is not always used for food production, but can be used for the production of export commodities like timber; whereas such developments threaten the food production potential of developing countries, The need to improve food security 1. Affirms that global food security is a question of the utmost urgency for the EU and the developing world and calls for immediate and continual action to ensure food security for EU citizens and at global level; stresses that food should be available to consumers at reasonable prices, while at the same time a fair standard of living for farmers should be ensured; 2. Stresses that the right to food is a basic and fundamental human right and it is achieved when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to suitable, safe (from the point of view of health) and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and preferences for an active and healthy life; 3. Stresses that a strong and sustainable agricultural sector across the EU and a thriving and sustainable rural environment, ensured by a strong CAP, are vital components in meeting the food security challenge; emphasises the importance of the CAP as a means to secure food production in the EU; 4. Affirms that the EU has a duty to ensure food security for its citizens and that continuing farming activity in the EU is key in this regard; draws attention to declining farm incomes in the EU, caused by rising production costs and price volatility, which impact negatively on farmers' ability to maintain production; highlights the costs that European farmers have to bear
