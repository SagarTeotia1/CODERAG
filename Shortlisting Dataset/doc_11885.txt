Question for written answer E-010799/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Catherine Bearder (ALDE) (22 November 2011) Subject: FP7 collaboration delay It has recently come to my attention that an organisation in my constituency called the ‘Science Trust’ has applied through the FP7 to collaborate with other organisations and to form the ‘Engineer Project’. The aim of both projects is to inspire young people to take an interest in the world of science. I believe that such projects are essential to the education of young people not only here in the UK but also throughout the EU. Unfortunately, the CEO of the Science Trust has encountered many problems with the validation process necessary for the organisation to obtain EU recognition. I appreciate that this process can be lengthy and time-consuming. However in this particular instance it took three months to complete. In light of this, does the Commission intend to review the process by which organisations collaborate under FP7 or would it consider doing so, while at the same time ensuring that the system is simplified and user-friendly?
