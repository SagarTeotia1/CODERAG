but to focus on punishing the perpetrators; notes that many women who are victims of human trafficking have no access to legal or social protection; calls on the Member States to grant these women the possibility of long-term residence; 11. Welcomes the simplification of instruments to ensure cross-border cooperation and hopes that they will be sufficiently flexible to guarantee such cooperation; 12. Calls on the Commission to recognise child migration as a distinct aspect of economic migration and to guarantee the rights of, and protection for, migrants who are minors, pursuant to Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; 13. Considers that the regulation of immigration between third countries would help to protect the human and labour rights of immigrants, whilst helping to track down human traffickers and bring them to justice; 14. Recommends that the Commission make it easier for legal migrants who have returned to developing countries to immigrate again to the EU than for migrants immigrating into the European Union for the first time, in recognition of the experience of integrating which they have gained; 15. Considers that it is essential to establish, in the countries of origin, demand-based educational systems with transparent procedures for issuing diplomas and qualifications, in order not only to consolidate trust on the EU's labour markets, but also to cover the needs of the countries of origin themselves; recommends that these countries should devise strategies to integrate the population, especially women, in the primary and secondary educational system, with particular emphasis on scientific training and their subsequent integration in the labour market; 16. Calls on the Commission to propose a regulation to ensure that, following their return to developing countries, economic migrants have access to the money paid by them into European social security schemes; 17. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to annul the transitional period laid down for the new Member States as regards the free movement of workers, in order to speed up the settlement of the issue of economic migration into the European Union.
