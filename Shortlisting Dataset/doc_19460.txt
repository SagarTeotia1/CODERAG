WRITTEN QUESTION E-5486/06 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (14 December 2006) Subject: Stamps with an AIDS theme According to the latest statistics of the United Nations AIDS agency, more than 47 million people have now been infected with the AIDS virus. The largest number of carriers of the AIDS virus are to be found in sub-Saharan Africa, where 24.7 million persons have been infected, most of them women. The population of South-Eastern and South Asia is equally affected by the virus and AIDS victims now number 7.8 million. It is estimated that 11000 persons are infected with this deadly virus every day: in other words 4.3 million persons overall become carriers every year. As part of the EU's efforts to combat the virus, will the Commission say whether Member States will print and sell stamps with an AIDS theme to be issued together with information leaflets on the best methods of prevention, with revenue being used for the purchase of pharmaceuticals?
