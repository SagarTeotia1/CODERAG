WRITTEN QUESTION E-2702/06 by Christoph Konrad (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 June 2006) Subject: Wide variety of problems during the start-up phase of Galileo 1. For some time now details have been emerging of the wide variety of problems affecting the start‑up phase of the European satellite programme Galileo. What explanation does the Commission have for the explosion in costs, from EUR 1.1 to EUR 1.4 billion, during the current start-up phase alone? What impact will this increase in costs have on the further development of the programme and on the original timetable, which provided for the system to be operational in 2008? Does the Commission expect further cost increases? If so, what kind ? 2. In the light of these new developments, what are the practical funding arrangements for the programme? What shares of the funding are provided by which individual countries, and which measures are funded from the Community budget? 3. What is the proportion of private funding and in what areas is this funding used? 4. How does the Commission intend to deal with the current shortcomings in coordination among the partners in the Community initiative and among the countries involved? 5. How does the distribution of ESA staff among the Member States compare with the individual countries' contributions to the ESA budget? How are ESA staff recruited?
