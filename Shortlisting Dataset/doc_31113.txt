Answer given by Mr Figel’ on behalf of the Commission (26 May 2005) The Commission considers that the risk that the Erasmus Mundus programme may cause a brain drain from third countries is very low. The increase in international mobility is tending to reveal a new phenomenon, ‘brain spread’, which may in the long term have a greater impact on international relations. Student grants have been calculated so as to be competitive with those offered by similar programmes worldwide — such as United States (US) Fulbright — to ensure that top-quality students are attracted to study in Europe and participate in the Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses. Excellence is the overarching principle of the Erasmus Mundus programme. Students from all the countries in the world (with neither exceptions nor priorities) are eligible to benefit from Erasmus Mundus scholarships provided they can certify their high quality to the selecting bodies. European students can receive Erasmus scholarships to follow an Erasmus Mundus Masters Course.
