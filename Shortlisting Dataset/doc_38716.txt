Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (2 May 2006) In the October 2005 comprehensive monitoring reports on Bulgaria and Romania, the Commission identified a limited number of areas where there were serious concerns about the countries’ state of preparedness. This included the fight against corruption and the two acceding countries were urged to take immediate and decisive actions to be in a position to implement the acquis by 2007. The precise terms of the accession negotiations were set by the Member States when they formally closed accession negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria in December 2004. Further details can be found in the Accession Treaty approved by the Parliament on 13 April 2005 and signed by the 27 states concerned on 25 April 2005. The Commission is engaged in an enhanced monitoring exercise of the situations in both countries and has conducted a large number of peer reviews involving experts from the Member States. Information is also collected from a range of other sources such as the governments in Sofia and Bucharest, civil society, EU business representatives and citizens to allow a balanced assessment to be made. The Commission will publish its next assessment on both countries on 16 May 2006.
