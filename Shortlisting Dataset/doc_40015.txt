Answer given by Mr Šefčovič on behalf of the Commission (3 March 2011) The reply to Written Question E‑9868/10 , to which the Honourable Member refers, concerned the appraisal of initiatives that ‘achieve the requisite number of statements of support’ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2010-9868&language=EN , that is to say those initiatives submitted to the Commission after obtaining the support of at least 1 million citizens according to the conditions laid down in the regulation on the citizens' initiative http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/10/pe00/pe00065-re02.en10.pdf . The general interests of the Union are not a consideration relating to the admissibility of a proposed initiative from a legal standpoint, nor are they included in the conditions for the registration of a proposed initiative as laid down in Article 4(2) of the regulation on the citizens' initiative. However, they will effectively constitute a factor to be taken into consideration when analysing the merits of citizens' initiatives submitted to the Commission pursuant to Article 9 of that regulation.
