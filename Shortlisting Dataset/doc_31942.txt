WRITTEN QUESTION E-0097/09 by Bastiaan Belder (IND/DEM) to the Commission (19 January 2009) Subject: Conscientious objections by farmers to compulsory vaccination against bluetongue Is it true that Member States are at liberty to make vaccination against bluetongue compulsory when transposing Council Directive 2000/75/EC OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 74. ? Does the Commission agree that differences of opinion clearly exist between Member States as to the need for compulsory vaccination of all livestock susceptible to bluetongue, as such vaccination is voluntary in the Netherlands but compulsory in Germany? Is the Commission aware that there are some farmers who have conscientious objections on religious grounds and do not wish to have their animals vaccinated? Does the Commission agree that, in view of the differences of opinion among Member States, farmers — albeit very small numbers of them — are unnecessarily being placed in the position of having to raise serious conscientious objections? If so, what can the Commission do about this?
