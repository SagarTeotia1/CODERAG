access to justice, a banking network with easy access to opening bank and savings accounts for small account holders, the empowerment of SMEs through the easy formation of limited liability companies, limited partnerships, accounting, auditing and bookkeeping functions, the availability of incubator, micro-credit, venture, and development capital and loans, the establishment of an information technology sector, training centres and schools for basic computer operations and the establishment of technical colleges and business schools; 10. Calls on the Member States and the EU to confirm their commitment to increase the funds for technical assistance and capacity building (TA/CB) enabling the EU's trade-related TA/CB to have a higher profile and be more effective; 11. Insists that a comprehensive trade policy and capacity-building should empower women, removing barriers to access to land, water, credit, markets, education and information technologies and promoting equal rights and the elimination of wage discrimination; 12. Calls for any new emphasis on capacity-building to enhance rather than act as a substitute for maintaining and increasing resources for development; Food security 13. Calls for access to food in sufficient quantities and of a sufficient quality to be recognised as a fundamental human right for the peoples of the developing countries, and, in that connection, issues an appeal for the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights regarding the right to food and well being and takes the view that national governments have a duty to honour that obligation; 14. Takes the view that the fight against poverty and food insecurity must incorporate an attack on the structural causes of poverty in the developing countries, and, accordingly, calls for: measures to foster access to land, water and the resources of biodiversity, measures to foster a policy of local support for sustainable agricultural smallholdings, the discontinuation of export subsidies which disrupt local markets, and the cancellation of the debt which swallows up more than 40% of the GNP of the LDCs; 15. Calls on the United Nations, at the FAO Summit and the Johannesburg Rio+10 Summit, to declare water and biodiversity world public goods; believes that water and genetic resources must be managed in a sustainable fashion; 16. Calls for an end to exports to developing countries of pesticides which are banned in the European Union and which endanger the health of the peoples of the developing countries, pollute the environment, contaminate groundwater and water in general and thereby undermine sustainable development; 17. Calls for the high degree of food security demanded for European consumers to be applied to foodstuffs and feedingstuffs intended for export to the developing countries (BSE-contaminated beef, dioxin-contaminated chicken, etc.) and calls for foodstuffs exported outside the EU to be labelled so as to provide consumers in the developing countries with full information; Doha 18. Notes that WTO Members at Doha committed themselves to a comprehensive strategy for trade-related capacity-building; notes also that this could provide the basis for bilateral and multilateral donors to ensure that market access, trade-related technical assistance, special and differential treatment is well integrated into the all EU's current and future technical assistance/development cooperation programming
