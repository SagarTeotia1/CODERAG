Reply (25 March 2008) In a pending Case C‑345/06 to which the Honourable Member refers the Court of Justice was asked to reply to two questions referred for a preliminary ruling by the Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat im Land Niederösterreich (Austria). The subject of the first question is the interpretation of Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. The subject of the second question is whether regulations or parts thereof have binding force if, contrary to the requirement of Article 254(2) EC, they are not published in the Official Journal of the European Union . The question refers to the annex of Commission Regulation (EC) No 68/2004 amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security. The legality of a Council act in the light of the above provision was not at issue in this case. In strict accordance with Article 254(2) of the EC Treaty the Council has always published its legislative acts in the Official Journal and will naturally continue to do so.
