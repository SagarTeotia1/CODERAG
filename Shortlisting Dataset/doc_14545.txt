Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (21 February 2011) The pharmaceutical legislation of the EU foresees specific instruments as incentives for the development of innovative medicines, in particular data exclusivity for specific studies, or market exclusivity for certain medicinal products for rare diseases. This could also potentially include specific medicinal products for women's diseases. Within this legal framework, pharmaceutical companies are free to choose which medicinal products they want to develop. There are also examples of research projects funded through the EU 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) that address specific questions linked to women's health, such as projects that aim at identifying genetic and environmental pathways that can be targeted to reduce preventable cardiovascular malformation http://www.chearted.eu/ or that focus on the identification of genetic factors in the context of maternal diabetes http://www.dali-project.eu/ . Finally, the Commission is putting special emphasis on the involvement of women in funded clinical trials. For example, in the 2011 call for proposals for the Health Theme http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=UserSite.FP7ActivityCallsPage&id_activity=1 of FP7, several topics for the support of clinical research specifically require that gender aspects must be appropriately considered. More generally, the Health Theme emphasises that when human beings are involved as users, gender differences may exist and that these must be addressed as an integral part of the research by the funded projects.
