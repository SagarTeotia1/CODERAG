ORAL QUESTION H-0218/03 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Josu Ortuondo Larrea to the Commission Subject: War against Iraq: Aerial refuelling of B-52 bombers over European cities The Basque Country and the whole of north-eastern Spain have been taken by surprise at newspaper reports on the route followed by B-52 bombers between their base at Fairford (England) and Iraq. It appears that they are being refuelled by KC-135 ‘stratotankers’ in the skies above Bilbao, Pamplona, Zaragoza and Barcelona, before entering the Mediterranean. Rather than refuelling over the Atlantic, they are cutting corners and flying close to towns and cities with hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, whose safety they are jeopardising. The Spanish airforce is banned from carrying out such operations over population centres. Does the Commission not consider the overflying by these aircraft of densely populated towns and cities to be an infringement of public safety? When coupled with the aerial refuelling operations, is this not showing disregard for the rights of the local populations, which are taking second place to a cruel war that is opposed by public opinion in Europe and world-wide and is being waged without the consent of the UN Security Council? Should the EU not reproach Mr Aznar and his government for allowing these dangerous operations to be conducted and for supporting and participating in the illegal war against Iraq?
