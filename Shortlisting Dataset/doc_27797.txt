9999/C Q999 E/198 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3870/03 by Alexander de Roo (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (05 December 2003) Subject: Ecological volume of the river Júcar and the Júcar-Vinalopó water transfer The gauge readings for the volume of the river Júcar at Cullera (the last gauge before the river reaches its mouth), which have been taken every day from 1 January 1995 until 24 November 2003 by the Júcar Hydrographic Confederation, give an average of 80.4 hm 3 per year (minimum 25.1 hm 3 in 1999 and maximum 175.3 hm 3 in 1997). The Júcar-Vinalopó canal which the Commission is supposed to be funding provides for a water transfer of 80 hm 3 per year, a figure which is totally unviable for a river as exhausted as the Júcar. It should be remembered that its total natural contribution is officially of the order of 1 600 hm 3 per year, barely 5% of which reaches the sea at present. And it is precisely the average of what reaches the sea that is supposed to be going to be transferred. On certain days, the gauge readings are effectively zero, which means that there is either no water passing or the levels are so low that the flow meter does not register them (i.e. a few litres per second). After this gauge, the river has no further tributaries other than a few irrigation drains, of no significance, because most of these irrigation drains run into the sea elsewhere. In the natural year 2002, the Júcar registered no contribution at all at its mouth on 219 days (i.e. 60% of the year), which means that it ceased to flow out at Cullera. It should be noted that both the Júcar Basin Hydrological Plan and the National Hydrological Plan assign the total remaining resources of the Júcar in Tous to various uses or reserves for extraction. This explains the tiny ecological water flow between Tous and Antella, and the absence of any ecological water flow from Antella onwards: the planning administration was aware that it had assigned the river's entire resources to various users, and was therefore unable legally to establish an ecological water flow, since there were no resources to do so. How does the Commission intend to apply the principle of no deterioration , and demand a minimum ecological water flow, in accordance with Framework Water Directive 2000/60/EC OJ L 327, 22.12.2000, p. 1 . under these conditions, considering, furthermore, that the middle and lower reaches of the Júcar are a Site of Community Interest under Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7 . ? And how can the Commission claim that this water transfer is ecologically viable, when it is obvious that for half of most years the river cannot supply the water transfer even if its own flow were completely eliminated, and taking account of the fact that the envisaged savings in traditional agriculture are utterly implausible and would be to the detriment of the Albufera Natural Park?
