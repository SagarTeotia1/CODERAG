for aflatoxins in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios and derived products The EFSA Journal (2007) 446, 1-127. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/cs/BlobServer/Scientific_Opinion/CONTAM%20_op_ej446_aflatoxins_en,3.pdf?ssbinary=true . The CONTAM Panel concluded that changing the maximum levels for total aflatoxins from 4 to 10 µg/kg in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios would have only minor effects on the estimates of dietary exposure and cancer risk. The Panel concluded furthermore that exposure to aflatoxins from all sources should be as low as reasonably achievable and that the reduction of total dietary exposure to aflatoxins should be achieved by reducing the number of highly contaminated foods reaching the market through more effective enforcement and reducing exposure from food sources other than almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios. Therefore, in accordance with the conclusions of the scientific opinion, the Commission has already taken initiatives to reinforce the controls on aflatoxins in hazelnuts and proposed recently to establish maximum levels for aflatoxins in foods, which were previously not covered by EU legislation. Finally, in relation to your third question, i.e. the support schemes available to producer organisations in order to shorten the distribution chain and give the product added value, you will be aware that among the objectives of the operational programmes of producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector, Article 103c (1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 OJ L 299, 16.11.2007, p. 1. mentions the promotion of the products, whether in a fresh or processed form. And Article 21(1)(f)(iii) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 OJ L 350, 31.12.2007 , p. 1. , where explaining the meaning of ‘measure’ reads: actions aimed at improving marketing, including acquisition of fixed assets, as well as promotion and communication activities.
