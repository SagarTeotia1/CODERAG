same time market discipline and the necessary external fiscal discipline of member countries, a middle way that can be effective but has to be designed with great precision. The present failures in the euro area are a valuable experience in order not to repeat the same mistakes. In this sense I propose the creation of a European Ministry of Finances and a European Treasury able to emit Eurobonds. I am conscious that this proposal can only become a reality after a much-needed reform on the Stability and Growth Pact that allows for a better control of the dysfunctional budgetary policies in the eurozone Member States. Eurobonds can simultaneously achieve a remarkable source of financing for countries with low levels of debt and a very expensive financing for those countries that break the rules, following the red and blue bonds model. Finally, Eurobonds can give an impulse to the euro as a global reserve currency, as with them a debt obligations market would be born on a European scale, five times bigger than the German one and closely as big as the North American. The euro’s architects built a monetary union while conscious of the instability that a single currency would generate in countries with a wide range of different economic and production structures. Possibly those architects thought that steps towards a bigger political union would come when the need for them was great. Today, with the full explosion of the debt-crisis in the eurozone, their time has finally come.
