Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (27 May 2005) For figures on the rate of implementation of the 2nd Cohesion Fund in Greece, the Honourable Member is referred to the answer of the Commission to Written Question E‑1515/05 by M. Papadimoulis. Before proposing a Cohesion Fund decision for adoption, the Commission takes due care to verify that the necessary preparatory work, such as environmental assessments and technical preparation, has been done. The responsibility for any delays that may occur thereafter lies with the Member State, in particular with the bodies responsible for the implementation and supervision of the projects.
