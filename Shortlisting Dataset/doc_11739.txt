EXPLANATORY STATEMENT The renewal of the terms of office of the directors of the 18 decentralised agencies and bodies set up under the first pillar raises a legal problem which has been identified by the Commission's legal service. The use of the term 'renewable' in the basic regulations for the various agencies harks back to Article 214(1) of the EC Treaty, on appointing Commission Members, and Articles 223 and 225 on appointing Court of Justice Judges. In neither case, however, may a simplified procedure be applied. If the same practice were applied, the various agencies would have to follow the lengthy -and expensive - appointment procedure laid down in the basic regulations in order to extend the term of office of their respective directors. To solve this problem, the Commission has submitted to us 18 proposals for regulations for the purpose of amending the various basic regulations. Your rapporteur approves the Commission proposals but is taking this opportunity to give Parliament a role in the procedures for the appointment, and renewal of the term of office of, the directors of the agencies in question.
