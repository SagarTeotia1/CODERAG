Answer given by Mr Bolkestein on behalf of the Commission (4 August 2003) The Honourable Member asks whether the Commission will estimate the potential for intra-Union trade in services and its impact on growth of output and employment. In preparation of its legislative response concerning the Internal Market for services, the Commission is currently drafting an impact assessment which will seek to explain the potential increase in cross-border service activities that could result from the elimination of existing Internal Market barriers. However, given the fact that statistics in this area suffer from severe measurement problems and that there do not currently exist recognised macro-economic forecasting models for service activities, the Commission would find it difficult to provide a detailed quantitative forecast of potential intra-Union trade and investment in services and their impact on output and employment. The measurement and modelling complexity is further heightened by the fact that much trade in services is hidden in statistics on trade in goods. It should also be noted that much internationalisation of services is based on foreign direct investment so an exclusive focus on services trade could underestimate the true potential of a properly functioning Internal Market for services. The Commission will make best efforts in its impact assessment, on the basis of existing statistics and information provided by stakeholders, to explain in more qualitative terms and on the basis of a micro-economic approach the potential impacts that could arise in the form of cost savings, growth in intra-Union services activities and growth in Union output and employment. In his second question, the Honourable Member queries whether the Commission will take account of developments in services trade in more integrated areas such as Canada and the United States. The Commission will, subject to the statistical limitations explained above, compare the performance of Union service markets with those in North America in its impact assessment.
