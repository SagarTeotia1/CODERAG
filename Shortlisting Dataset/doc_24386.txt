Question for written answer E-004437/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Simon Busuttil (PPE) (4 May 2011) Subject: Dialogue with Tunisia and Egypt on immigration The Justice and Home Affairs Council of 11 and 12 April welcomed the outcome of the visits of the Presidency and the Commission to Egypt and Tunisia and the intention of the Commission to follow up these visits by setting up dialogues with the authorities of these countries. The Council concluded that these dialogues should in the first instance focus on the identification and promotion of measures which can contribute in a practical and effective way: — to the prevention of illegal migration — to the effective management and control of their external borders, — to the facilitation of the return and readmission of irregular migrants, and — to the development of protection in the region for those in need, including through regional protection programmes. How does the Commission intend to follow up these proposals?
