Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (24 February 2009) The Commission has analysed the information received up to now with a view to establish whether on this basis the payments to Romania could be resumed. The result of this analysis is that with regard to certain issues more information is required. The decision to resume the payments depends on the satisfactory follow-up to the additional requests made to the Romanian authorities.
