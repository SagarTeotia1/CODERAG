ORAL QUESTION H-0514/02 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Cecilia Malmström to the Commission Subject: Schengen and medicines Under Article 75 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, travellers must be able to produce a certificate showing that any medicines they are carrying are for their own use. However, this certification may be valid for no more than 30 days, so it is only possible to carry medicine for 30 days with one while travelling. Nowadays it is frequently the case that travellers are abroad for longer than 30 days. It could be regarded as an obstacle to the freedom of movement of persons that people dependent on medicines are required to produce a certificate. Is it the Commission's intention that this should be so, and if not, what does the Commission propose to do about it?
