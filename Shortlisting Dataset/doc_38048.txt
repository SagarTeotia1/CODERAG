rights by: (a) respecting the religious freedom of all religious communities in PlaceTypePlaceTypeBelarus; (b) making vitally needed changes to the Belarus Penal Code by abolishing Articles 193, 367, 368 and 369-1, some of which, in particular Article 193, have been cited by Amnesty International and are often misused as a means of repression; (c) eliminating all obstacles to the proper registration of NGOs in PlaceTypePlaceTypeBelarus; (d) refraining from threatening criminal prosecution, including for avoiding military service in Belarus, against students who have been expelled from universities for their civic stance and thereby obliged to continue their studies abroad; (e) improving the treatment of and respect for national minorities, including recognition of the legitimately elected body of the Union of Poles in Belarus - led by Angelika Borys - and minorities' cultures, churches, education systems and historical and material heritage, in order to end the country’s self-imposed isolation from the rest of Europe and in order for relations between the EU and PlaceTypePlaceTypeBelarus to improve significantly; 5. Reiterates that the European Union has declared its readiness to renew its relationship with PlaceTypePlaceTypeBelarus and its people within the framework of the ENP as soon as the Belarusian Government demonstrates respect for democratic values and for the basic rights of the Belarusian people; 6. Considers that the repeated deportations of Roman Catholic priests and nuns from Belarus represents a serious breach of Christians’ religious freedom in that country; takes the view, in this context, that the Belarusian Government is breaching a fundamental aspect of human rights and that its actions run counter to the confidence-building process between EU and Belarus; 7. Calls on the Council and Commission to continue the dialogue with and devise a policy vis-à-vis Belarus, subject to strict positive conditionality based on a gradual, step-by-step approach, incorporating benchmarks, timetables and a revision clause and drawing on adequate financial resources; 8. Welcomes the Council decision to suspend the existing restrictive measures for a period of six months, with a view to demonstrating that the EU is ready to start cooperation with PlaceTypePlaceTypeBelarus; 9. Calls on the Council and Commission to take further steps to simplify and liberalise visa procedures for Belarusian citizens, as such action is crucial to fulfilling the main goal of EU policy towards Belarus, namely that of facilitating and intensifying people-to-people contacts and democratising the country; urges the Council and Commission, in this context, to consider the scope for reducing the cost of visas for Belarusian citizens entering the Schengen Area, which is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming increasingly isolated; calls on the Belarusian authorities to end their practice of issuing exit visas to their citizens, in particular children and students; 10. Calls on the Council and Commission to increase financial aid to the independent media, NGOs and Belarusian students studying abroad; welcomes the financial support given by the Commission to the Belarusian 'European Humanities University' in exile in Vilnius (Lithuania); calls on the Council and Commission to grant financial support to the independent Belarusian television channel Belsat and to urge the Belarusian Government
