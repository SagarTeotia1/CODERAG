Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (19 June 2009) It is for the Council to decide on the way ahead on Albania's application for EU membership and on requesting the Commission to prepare an Opinion on its merits. The Commission stands ready to play its institutional role, should the Council invite it to do so. The Commission continues to underline to the Albanian authorities that it is now up to Albania to demonstrate its capacity to move on to the next stage of EU integration, including by ensuring respect for democratic principles and human rights. The holding of the parliamentary elections in June 2009 in a free and fair manner remains a key condition in that respect.
