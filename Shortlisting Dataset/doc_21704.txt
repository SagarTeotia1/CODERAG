Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (4 February 2011) Directive 2006/22/EC Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities and repealing Council Directive 88/599/EEC, OJ L 102, 11.4.2006 . prescribes that the Commission issues a report on penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport by 1 May 2009. The report, drafted within the deadline prescribed and on the basis of the information made available by Member States, shows that for the large sample of Member States covered, rules on penalties vary substantially as regards the types of penalties, the level of fines and the categorisation of infringements. Additional data coming from the missing Member States is not expected to modify the findings of the anlysis. Based on the information already available, the Commission will investigate the extent to which it would be possible or appropriate to envisage further measures at Union level to promote consistent enforcement of the social rules in road transport throughout all Member States.
