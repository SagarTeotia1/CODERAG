Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (25 October 2006) The question relates to a system for interception of communications, provided by a specific company The background to the question can be found in an article in Malta Today of 30 July and 27 August 2006: http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2006/07/30/top_story.html and http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2006/08/27/t9.html . The Commission is aware of different reports regarding both the activities of the company in question and the interception systems used in the United States of America. However, the Commission is for the moment not in a position to comment on these reports, which are mainly concerned with circumstances lying outside the EU. Regarding the procurement procedure for the contract to provide Maltese Security Services with the technology for an interception system, the Commission understands that the procedure is presently being examined by Maltese jurisdictions, which for the time being must be considered the most accurate forum for such examination. Against this background, the Commission does not consider looking into the procurement procedure for the award of the contract in question, unless the Honourable Member is aware of a potential breach of European Community rules on public procurement in the award of the contract in question.
