P6_TA(2007)0603 Mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument A6-0499/2007 European Parliament resolution of 12 December 2007 on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument ( COM(2007)0786 - C6-0450/2007 - 2007/2273(ACI) ) The European Parliament , – having regard to the Commission proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council ( COM(2007)0786 - C6-0450/2007 ), – having regard to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1. , and in particular Point 27 thereof, – having regard to its resolution of 20 June 2007 on the financing of the European programme of satellite radionavigation (Galileo) under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 and the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013 Texts adopted , P6_TA(2007)0272 . , – having regard to its first reading on the 2008 draft general budget, – having regard to the outcome of the conciliation meeting of 23 November 2007, – having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgets ( A6-0499/2007 ), A. whereas the budgetary authority considers it imperative to adequately fund the GNSS Programmes, B. whereas increasing needs in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) area were of great concern during the preparation of the 2008 Budget, particularly in view of the need to mobilise the necessary resources for the EU mission in Kosovo, C. whereas the two arms of the budgetary authority decided at the conciliation meeting on 23 November 2007 to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to complement the financing in the 2008 budget of: – the European GNSS programmes (EGNOS-GALILEO) for an amount of EUR 200 million; – the CFSP for an amount of EUR 70 million; 1. Notes that the respective ceilings of Heading 1A and Heading 4 did not allow for an adequate financing of Galileo and the CFSP in 2008; 2. Recalls that the Flexibility Instrument was called for six times under the previous financial perspective 2000-2006; 3. Welcomes the agreement reached during the conciliation on the use of the Flexibility Instrument in favour of GNSS Programmes and the CFSP for a total amount of EUR 270 million; 4. Underlines the joint efforts that have safeguarded sufficient resources for new and existing CFSP/ESDP missions, in particular the planned EU Police Mission in Kosovo; 5. Reiterates, however, that external actions in general, and CFSP in particular, are not sufficiently catered for in the long term compared to the demands now identified; is convinced that CFSP funding suffers from this structural problem and that it merits a multi-annual solution for future years (as proved by the fact that needs for both 2007 and 2008 largely exceed the annual forecasts made at the time of adopting the financial framework); would therefore welcome proposals from Commission and Council indicating possible ways forward; 6. Approves the decision annexed to this resolution; 7. Instructs its President to arrange for publication of this decision in the Official Journal of the European Union. 8. Instructs its
