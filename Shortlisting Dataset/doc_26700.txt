WRITTEN QUESTION E-2551/08 by Gabriele Stauner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (6 May 2008) Subject: Value-added tax (VAT) fraud — European Court of Auditors' Special Report No 8/2007 Large -scale VAT evasion and fraud are disrupting fair competition on the EU internal market and reducing Member States' tax revenues by around EUR 60 bn to EUR 100 billion a year. In its Special Report No 8/2007 concerning administrative cooperation in the field of value-added tax — see paragraphs III and IV of the report — the European Court of Auditors explains that these tax revenue losses are, to a large extent, the result of fraudsters exploiting the fact that, for intra-Community trade, goods supplied are exempted from VAT and tax needs to be paid in the country of destination only. Under one method of tax evasion described by the Court of Auditors, goods are declared for intra-Community delivery, but are in fact not delivered to another EU country; rather, they remain on the domestic market and are sold there without payment of VAT. What findings does the Commission have as to whether this fraud scheme is one explanation why statistics on intra-Community trade do not ‘add up’? Normally, anything declared by one party as an export ought to be registered by another party as an import. In fact, however, Eurostat-produced statistics on trade between Member States — see Eurostat document ‘External and intra-European Union trade’, No 4/2008, p. 36 — identify an import value shortfall of close to EUR 80 billion for 2007. Is this question being examined in the Commission-contracted study on tax fraud in the EU (see paragraph 92 of the Commission's replies in the Court of Auditors' special report)? When will (interim) results from the study be published?
