K. Rowling have become some of the most widely read works of children's literature in history, with readers of all ages and in many countries.", " In April 2011 worldwide sales of Harry Potter books were estimated to be about 450 million copies.", " Oddly enough, it has been difficult to accurately determine with any degree of certainty exactly how many languages Harry Potter has been translated into.", " As best as can be determined (as of 2017), The Philosopher's Stone has been officially translated from the original English into 73 other languages.", " A 74th language, Scots, was announced on 2017-06-28 and it is expected to be available in October, 2017.", " Both Bloomsbury's and J.K. Rowling's sites have recently stated that the books have been translated into 79 languages (80 with the 2017-06-28 announcement of Scots); however, it has been argued that number actually represents the number of authorized translations (of The Philosopher's Stone) plus the original English.", " The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages because there have been multiple authorized translations into the same language.", " Specifically, there have been two separate translations into each of: Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish (5 languages).", " English is often included in the list of translations even though technically it should not be (indeed, it is why our list here counts up to 74).", " Thus: 79 − English − 5 double-translations = 73.", " It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books are have been translated into these 73 languages." ] ] ] }
