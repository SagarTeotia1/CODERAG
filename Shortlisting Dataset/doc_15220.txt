WRITTEN QUESTION E-3531/06 by Bernat Joan i Marí (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (26 July 2006) Subject: Deterioration of the ecosystem in Puig d'Alaró (Majorca) The Puig d'Alaró constitutes a habitat of Community interest which has been declared an SCI (SE5310090 Puig d'Alaró — Puig de s'Alcadena) on account of the high botanical value of its native flora. The presence of large numbers of goats has caused the vegetation to deteriorate to such an extent that species which form an integral part of the ecosystem are dying out and the very survival of the habitat is at stake. 1. Is the Commission aware of the severe deterioration affecting the habitat on account of the intensive farming of wild goats? 2. Does the Commission know whether or not the Balearic Islands' Government (to which powers and responsibilities in this area have been transferred) has introduced arrangements for monitoring and remedying the severe deterioration affecting the SCI in question?
