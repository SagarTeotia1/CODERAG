WRITTEN QUESTION E-2718/10 by Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (22 April 2010) Subject: Issue of Eurobonds to cover the Public Borrowing Requirements of Member States In the report on the 2009 Annual Statement on the Euro Area and Public Finances http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2010-0072&language=EL adopted by the European Parliament by a large majority at its plenary sitting of 25 March 2010, Parliament ‘Calls on the Commission to propose a set of measures to help Member States restore balance in their public accounts … through … eurobonds or similar measures … considering that interest rate spreads between Member States have not fallen below pre-crisis levels’. On the same day the Heads of State and Government of the Euro Area issued a joint statement http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/113563.pdf recognising ‘that the Greek authorities have taken ambitious and decisive action which should allow Greece to regain the full confidence of the markets’, but failed to take any support measures beyond planning a mechanism of last resort (ultima ratio). During the weeks that followed, Greece saw the spread of borrowing rates reach unsustainable levels, despite the contrary views expressed in the above Joint Statement. As a result, the resources saved through painful austerity measures are being spent on increased debt servicing costs, instead of being used to bring about an immediate reduction in the budgetary deficit, the purpose for which they were intended. In this context, the decisions taken on 25 March 2010 do not appear to have had the expected results so far. In view of the above, will the Commission say: Does it intend to propose that eurobonds be issued, as the European Parliament has demanded, with a view to keeping borrowing costs in countries such as Greece at levels recognised as reasonable in the Joint Statement by the Heads of State and Government of the Euro Area on 26 March 2010?
