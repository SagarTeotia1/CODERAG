ORAL QUESTION H-0912/05 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Dimitrios Papadimoulis to the Council Subject: Agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspective One of the Presidency's main priorities, as presented to Parliament on 23 June 2005, is to make progress on financing the EU and the 2007-2013 financial perspective. Bearing in mind that a last minute agreement will compromise the timely planning and the sound implementation of the Community's multiannual programmes, will the Council say what progress has been made in discussions on this issue? What measures does it intend to take to obtain an agreement before the end of the UK Presidency?
