Question for written answer E-006626/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Elisabetta Gardini (PPE) (11 July 2011) Subject: Environmental impact of advertising mail Every day European citizens receive supermarket special offers, catalogues, estate agency brochures and advertising material of various kinds in their mail. Most of this paper will inevitably be pulped, with the disposal costs falling on citizens via their refuse collection bills. According to published statistics, every year a European citizen receives on average 13 kg of unsolicited advertising material which has to be disposed of. The distribution of advertising flyers results directly in the creation of refuse when the material concerned is discarded. In the light of the environmental impact caused by the huge quantities of refuse being distributed, will the Commission answer the following: What will it do to promote harmonisation among the Member States with regard to the house-to-house delivery of advertising material? Does it think that round tables should be set up to gauge and assess the environmental impact of the advertising distribution industry?
