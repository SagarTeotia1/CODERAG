Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2005) Regarding the top marginal rates of personal income tax in the Member States, the thresholds at which these rates begin to operate as well as comparisons with Japan and the United States, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to his written question E-2716/04 OJ C … . Social security contributions are applied only to income related to labour with different rates regarding the type of labour (employed or self-employed) and the sector of activity. Furthermore different levels of social contributions correspond to different levels of benefits granted to the workers, in this way differing from personal income taxation. For those reasons it would not be possible to provide representative tax rates including social security contributions.
