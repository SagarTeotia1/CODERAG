Answer given by Mr Figel on behalf of the Commission (8 April 2005) While apprenticeship is the predominant form of initial Vocational Education and Training (VET) in some Member States, in others it plays only a marginal role. A separate programme for apprentices would benefit some Member States more than others and would hinder exchanges between countries where initial VET is predominantly enterprise-based and those where it is predominantly institution-based. The Commission therefore intends to continue to promote trans-national mobility of apprentices and other young people undergoing initial VET within Leonardo da Vinci, which from 2007 will constitute a separate strand of the integrated Lifelong Learning Programme. Leonard da Vinci is exclusively designed for people in VET. Young people in initial vocational training (including apprentices) are the greatest beneficiaries of Leonardo da Vinci mobility. They account for some 105,000 or 47% of the total of 223,000 people who received a mobility grant under Leonardo da Vinci II in the 2000-2004 period. The other beneficiary groups are students on work placements abroad About 47,000 or 21% of total beneficiaries , young workers and recent graduates About 42,000 or 19% , and trainers, tutors and human resource managers About 29,000 or 13% . Leonardo da Vinci mobility actions differ in both scale and nature from Socrates-Erasmus student exchanges. This reflects the greater complexity and per-capita cost of organising mobility for people in vocational training owing to the fragmented nature of VET provision in Europe and to the different profile of the participants in terms of age, educational attainment and socio-economic background. The Commission’s proposal for the integrated Lifelong Learning programme COM (2004)474 final , which will replace the current Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes from 2007, envisages a three-fold increase in VET mobility from its current level of about 50,000 a year to a total of 150,000 a year by 2013. At the initiative of the European Parliament, a new line ligne 15.03.01.05. was created in the 2005 budget allocating € 2 million to pilot actions for an Erasmus-type programme for apprentices and young people in initial vocational training. The Commission intends to use this budget line to explore a number of issues, such as credit transfer, or the statute of apprentices, which are obstacles to Erasmus-type mobility for this beneficiary group. The results of this work will feed into the models of mobility proposed under the Leonardo da Vinci strand of the integrated Lifelong Learning Programme.
