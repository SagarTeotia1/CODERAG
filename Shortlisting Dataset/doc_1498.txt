WRITTEN QUESTION E-3393/10 by Alain Cadec (PPE) to the Commission (14 May 2010) Subject: ERDF financing in Brittany In December 2007, the Commission approved an operational programme for the region of Brittany covering the period 2007‑13. The programme comes under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective and has a total budget of around EUR 878 million. The EU is contributing EUR 302 million of this from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The operational programme is centred on four main priorities: 1. to ‘make Brittany an accessible and attractive European region in order to foster balanced, sustainable development’ (around 39.0 % of the total investment); 2. to ‘improve competitiveness and regional economic performance through innovation and knowledge’ (around 40.1 % of the total investment); 3. to ‘optimise the exceptional assets of Brittany in the maritime economy and marine sciences with a view to achieving sustainable coastal development’ (around 8.8 % of the total investment); 4. to ‘preserve the environment and prevent natural risks’ (11.8 % of the total investment). Mid-way through the 2007‑13 programme period, can the Commission provide an update on the progress made towards each of these four aims?
