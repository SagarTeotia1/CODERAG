ORAL QUESTION H-0658/08 for Question Time at the part-session in September II 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Frank Vanhecke to the Commission Subject: Press freedom in Turkey Haci Bogatekin, publisher of the newspaper 'Gerger Firat', has been in custody since 13 April 2008 after writing in an article published in January 2008 that the Turkish Republic faces a greater threat from increasing Islamic fundamentalism than from the PKK. In the article in question, he also sharply criticised the army's campaign against the PKK in the region, at a time when the influence of the Islamist movement founded by Fethullah Gülen, which has close ties with the AKP, is steadily increasing. When the State Prosecutor Sadullah Ovacikli questioned him about this, the journalist published an article stating that Ovacikli himself has close links with Fethullah Gülen. On 25 June 2008 Bogatekin was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. He may face further imprisonment for a breach of Article 301 of the Turkish Criminal Code, following the publication of another article. In the Commission's view, does this sentencing of a journalist to a term of imprisonment represent a breach of freedom of the press and freedom of expression? If so, what steps is the Commission taking and what impact will the case have on the current accession negotiations?
