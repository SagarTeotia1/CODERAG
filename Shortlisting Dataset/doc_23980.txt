Joint answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission Written questions : P-0460/07 , E-0816/07 , E-0817/07 , E-0818/07 , E-0819/07 , E-0815/07 , E-0820/07 , E-0814/07 (27 April 2007) The aim of the Europe Direct Centres is neither to express any views nor opinions, but to give factual, clear and precise information on EU matters and to promote democratic dialogue and debate. The Europe Direct Centres are set up at local level in order to be as close to the citizens as possible. The mission of this network is not only to distribute information about the policies in any of the official EU languages, but also to actively promote local and regional debate about the EU and give the general public the opportunity to send feedback to the European Union institutions. Under the terms of its current four‑year agreements, the Commission enters into a match-funded partnership with host bodies (many of them local authorities or chambers of commerce) to run one or more Europe Direct outlets, but it does not own the outlets. As such, the hosts are free to display literature covering the range of views on the EU in addition to the publications which the Commission provides. The material and information that the Commission publishes and that is available at the Europe Direct Centres explains the rationale behind the different EU policies and all their plausible effects in the Member States. Very often these publications contain statistical data and tables which indicate the direct impact of EU Membership in each Member State. The national networks receive thousands of personal contacts per year, mainly by e-mail or by phone. In addition, they provide a great number of speeches and participate in numerous events on a local and regional level. Overall, Europe Direct Centres have many tens of thousands of contacts with citizens per year.
