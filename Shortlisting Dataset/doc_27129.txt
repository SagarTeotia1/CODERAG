Question for written answer E-5499/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) (14 July 2010) Subject: Murder of the trade unionist José Juan Rosales Pérez in Mexico José Juan Rosales Pérez, a prominent activist in the Mexican electricians’ union (SME), was killed on 24 June. As the union reported in a press release, he was murdered on his way home by gunmen. He had already received threats many times before. A few weeks ago several SME activists began a hunger strike in protest at the loss of their jobs following the demise of the body that used to supply electricity to Mexico City and dozens of municipalities in Mexico State, Morelos, Puebla, and Hidalgo. Bearing in mind that the EU sets particular store by the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that Article 2 of the EU‑Mexico Partnership Agreement, signed on 8 December 1997, contains a human rights clause: 1. Is the Council aware of the above facts? 2. Does it consider these events to be compatible with the terms of the agreement? 3. Will it seek information from the Mexican authorities about the killing of trade unionists?
