Reply (4 March 2004) The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the fact that it is not within the Council's competencies to revise the text of the Treaty establishing the European Community. Such a revision can only take place within the framework of an intergovernmental conference and by subsequent ratification by the Member States. Furthermore, it is recalled that the European Parliament has taken an active part in the work carried out by the European Convention, and has presumably been in a position to present views on the issue raised by the Honourable Member in that framework.
