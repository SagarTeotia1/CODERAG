Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (29 February 2012) 1. The definition of electromagnetic disturbance is laid down in Article 2 of Directive 2004/108/EC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility. The Commission proposal for a revision of this directive (COM(2011) 765 final) includes a minor change to the wording of this definition, resulting in a clearer formulation of the current definition without modifying its substance. 2-3. The proposal for a revision of Directive 2004/108/EC consists of an alignment of the directive to Decision 765/2008/EC (the ‘New Legal Framework Decision’). The proposal maintains the current regulatory policy for products covered by the directive, and in particular does not change provisions for radio equipment used by radio amateurs. The alignment of this and 9 other directives to Decision 765/2008/EC was the subject of an extensive public consultation between 20.5.2010 and 15.10.2010. 4. The Commission considers that the alignment of Directive 2004/108/EC to Decision 765/2008/EC will substantially improve the legal framework of the internal market for all products within its scope. Following implementation of the revised directive, the Commission will consider whether further revision of the directive is necessary.
