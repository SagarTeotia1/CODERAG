Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (28 November 2011) Directive 93/42/EEC OJ L 169, 12.7.1993. concerning medical devices does not itself contain provisions in relation to the authorisation of establishments carrying out animal testing or in relation to the reliability of animal data in case the animal testing was carried out in unauthorised establishments. Clinical investigations in humans are in certain cases preceded by tests carried out on animals in order to protect the health and safety of the humans participating in such investigations. Any animal testing carried out in the European Union and falling within the scope of Directive 86/609/EEC OJ L 358, 18.12.1986. (replaced on 10 November 2010 by Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes OJ L 276, 20.10.2010. ) must be carried out in compliance with this directive. Both the 1986 directive as well as the new one include a strict requirement for the user establishments/users to be authorised by the competent authority. Member States are responsible for the practical implementation, application and enforcement of the respective national legislation within their territory.
