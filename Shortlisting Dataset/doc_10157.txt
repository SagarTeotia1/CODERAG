Such operations are financed from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, under a budget line created by Parliament in 1994. This is the only programme which the agreement of the national authorities in the country where the activity takes place is not required, which makes it highly politically sensitive. The present proposal extends the existing regulation (adopted in 1999) for a further two years and makes a number of changes required by the new Financial Regulation adopted in 2002. New aspects include better information for Parliament on the work of the committee which implements the regulation. Parliament adopted amendments to clarify the list of eligible partners for funding. As well as governmental and non-governmental organisations, individuals will be able to obtain community funding for observing elections or taking part in a trial. Parliament also wants to be informed regularly and in detail of the programmes set up by the Commission and their implementation.
