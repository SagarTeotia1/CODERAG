Commission proposal for 2007 budget must be read independently from the 2006 appropriations. People No major differences exist between the budget requested for this programme in 2007 and the FP6 2006 “Marie Curie” actions. Capacities The budget will be devoted to ensuring optimal use and development of research infrastructures. Under this specific objective appropriations have been requested for the financing of activities already existing under FP6; in addition, finance is requested for new activities devoted to the strengthening the research potential of European regions. TITLE 09: INFORMATION SOCIETY AND MEDIA For 2007, DG INFSO’s objectives derive directly from the i 2010 strategy. The activities of lines 09 02 (Electronic communications policy and network security) and 09 06 (Audiovisual Policy and Media programme) are directly linked to the first pillar of i2010. Two research activities ( 09 04 Cooperation — Information and communication and 09.05 Capacities — Research infrastructures ) contribute to the second pillar of i2010 and fall within the FP7 (new lines). The activities of line 09 03 (Content and services) relates to the third pillar of i2010, where a new line has been created for the ICT policy support programme of CIP. There is no significant variation in the financial and human resources with respect to the 2006 budget. TITLE 10: DIRECT RESEARCH The budget for title 10 has been increased from EUR 329,60 million to EUR 348,47 million (increase of 5,73%). The majority of the activities listed in the two specific programmes for the JRC were already covered by the FP6 and will be continued in the FP7.
