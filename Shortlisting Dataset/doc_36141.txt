Question for written answer E-007657/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (2 August 2011) Subject: Manipulation of the forthcoming elections in Egypt Egypt’s governing authority, the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF), has stated that it will not allow international observers to monitor the forthcoming government elections scheduled for the autumn, and that the transparency of those elections will be verified by government officials. However, according to press commentators, the decision to exclude international observers could be aimed at enabling the elections to be manipulated so as to ensure that they are won by the Freedom and Justice Party, or in other words the Muslim Brotherhood. Since: 1. the manipulation of elections has for decades been a common feature of political life in contemporary Egypt; 2. according to many commentators, the SCAF has already shown itself not to be impartial and to have leanings towards Islamophile and anti‑Christian forms of government, does the Commission not feel it should exert pressure on the SCAF, and on the international community, to allow international observers to monitor the government elections?
