Question for written answer E-003743/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jörg Leichtfried (S&D) , Knut Fleckenstein (S&D) , Jutta Steinruck (S&D) , Evelyn Regner (S&D) , Thomas Händel (GUE/NGL) , Thomas Mann (PPE) and Udo Bullmann (S&D) (15 April 2011) Subject: Review of Directive 96/67/EC on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports In its work programme for 2011, the Commission announced that it would submit an airport package. The review of Directive 96/67/EC is to be an essential part of this package. Directive 96/67/EC has had negative consequences on the quality of service and has led to social distortions. Nevertheless, it would appear that the Commission intends to further deregulate the market. 1. In amending Directive 96/67/EC, how will the Commission satisfy the EU objectives of a competitive social market economy and social progress, as laid down in the EU Treaty? 2. How have efficiency, quality of service, working conditions and worker income at airports changed since the adoption of Directive 96/67/EC? 3. How will the Commission safeguard workers’ social conditions, the quality of the services offered and the efficiency of the entire system? 4. How will it prevent an increase in the number of low-paid jobs when service providers change? 5. What effects would a further step towards liberalisation have on the economic situation of many groundhandling service providers in the Member States? What consequences might this have on the continuity of the offer of services? 6. In the Commission’s view, what measures should be taken to safeguard European training and qualification standards?
