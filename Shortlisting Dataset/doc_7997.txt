Answer given by Mr Lamy on behalf of the Commission (31 March 2003) The Commission does not have any additional information on the matter raised by the Honourable Member concerning the business tax paid by Italian shipping companies working in the People's Republic of China. The Agreement on Sea Transport between Italy and China does not appear to include the relevant provisions on the business tax, whereas such provisions are foundin the aggreements that other Member States have concluded with China. Agreements on double taxation are normally exempted from the Most Favoured Nations (MFN) obligation of the GATS agreement (General Agreement on Trade in Services). Article XIV of the GATS allows for measures that are inconsistent with Article II (the MFN principle), provided that the difference in treatment is the result of an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation or provisions on the avoidance of double taxation in any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Member is bound. The business tax issue is also exempted from the recently signed EU — China Maritime Agreement. In particular Article 2 (Scope), paragraphe 2 states that the agreement shall not affect the application of the bilateral maritime agreements concluded between China and the member States of the Community for issues not falling within the scope of the agreement. The responsible Commission Services are in close contact with the respective National Administrations of Member States and with shipping industry representatives and associations in order to ensure the early ratification as well as the accurate implementation of the EU-China Maritime Agreement to the benefit of the European shipping industry.
