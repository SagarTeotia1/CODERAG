Question for written answer E-012463/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Frank Vanhecke (EFD) (6 January 2012) Subject: Freedom of information and expression in South Africa The South African Parliament recently finally passed the Protection of State Information Bill. The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch believes that this bill constitutes a threat to freedom of expression and information. If this bill (in its present form) is implemented, journalists, whistleblowers and others could be imprisoned for up to 25 years for leaking or sharing information which exposes corruption, mismanagement and negligence by the government and administration. International law does allow for limitations on the freedom of information and expression but these exceptions must be very narrowly and strictly defined in law. This is not the case in this instance (Human Rights Watch, ‘South Africa: Vote on Protection of Information Bill Damaging’, 22 November 2011). The European Union has a strategic partnership and various agreements with South Africa, and also gives massive development aid to the country. Article 2 of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement defines respect for human rights as essential and Article 3 lays down a procedure in the event of non-compliance with the provisions of the Agreement. Does the Commission agree with Human Rights Watch’s criticisms? If not, why is this not an infringement of Article 2? If so, what steps will the Commission take in accordance with Article 3 of the Agreement and development aid?
