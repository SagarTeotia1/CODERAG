ORAL QUESTION H-0340/07 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou to the Commission Subject: Political crisis in Turkey and prospects of accession In the last few days, in connection with the appointment of the President of the Republic, Turkey has fallen into a deep political crisis which gives rise to serious doubts about the functioning of its democratic institutions. The country's Constitutional Court has annulled the first round of the elections, a decision vigorously contested by the government. The Prime Minister has stated that the parliamentary system has been brought to a halt and he is calling for early elections, while the General Army Staff has issued a warning that it will intervene to prevent the election of the Islamist, Abdullah Gül, to the office of President. What are the Commission's views on this situation in a candidate country for accession to the EU? The Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Olli Rehn, has stated that the armed forces should respect the independent role of the democratic process, that the EU is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and the sovereignty of political forces vis-à-vis the military, stressing that any country seeking accession to the EU must respect those principles, which are the key elements of the Copenhagen criteria. Does the Commission believe that such interventions by the military are consistent with the requirements of the Community acquis and what impact could they have on the country's accession procedure? Can any further response from the Commission be expected if developments are not compatible with the democratic principles of the EU?
