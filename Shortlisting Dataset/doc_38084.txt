Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (26 August 2005) In the last five years, i.e., during the fifth and sixth Community research and technological development (RTD) framework programmes, no research project proposal of sufficient quality was received on this specific topic. The Community has, therefore, not been in a position to fund research on the issue. While the Commission is aware of the potential health risks to school children from carrying excessively heavy school bags, the Commission considers that it would be up to the Member States to take action at the appropriate level.
