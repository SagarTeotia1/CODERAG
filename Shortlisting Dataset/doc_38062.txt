Question for written answer E-9249/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Gabriel Mato Adrover (PPE) and Pablo Arias Echeverría (PPE) (9 November 2010) Subject: Agroisleña 3 On 3 October 2010, Hugo Chávez, President of Venezuela, speaking on his ‘Aló Presidente’ (Hello President) talk show, announced the expropriation of the Agroisleña group of undertakings and went on to indicate that a number of legal measures would be taken, including Decree 7700 providing for compulsory purchase, involving the physical and administrative appropriation on a provisional basis of all movables and real estate or the dismissal of former directors. Does the Council consider that the expropriation proceedings may have infringed the right to economic freedom and property ownership?
