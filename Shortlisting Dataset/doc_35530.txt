2008 to 31 December 2016). It is calculated by each Member State individually, on the basis of its annual final (i.e. end-use) energy consumption, using an average of the most recent five-year period previous to the implementation of the directive. In order to achieve a 20 % reduction from current levels of primary energy use (i.e. 1 750 Mtoe), the action plan would need to reduce primary energy consumption in 2020 (estimated to be 1 890 Mtoe) to 1 400 Mtoe, or 100 Mtoe more than in the current objective of 1 500 Mtoe. Compared to the baseline value in 2020, this would equate to a more than 25 % reduction of the 2020 baseline value (1 890 Mtoe) instead of the present objective of 20 %.
