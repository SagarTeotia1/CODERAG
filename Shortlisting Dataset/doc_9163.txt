other fertilisers. The quantities of potassium nitrate involved at these stages are significant. Under the transport regulations potassium nitrate was classified as a division 5.1 oxidising agent in packaging group 3, corresponding to the lowest level of risk. On the basis of tests subsequently carried out by an accredited European institute (TNO Prins Maurits Laboratory, Rijkswijk Netherlands), potassium nitrate in prilled form (that most commonly used for agricultural purposes) cannot even be classified as an oxidising agent. The Council rejected Amendment 40 adopted by Parliament at first reading, without providing any justification. In view of its scientific basis it is therefore proposed to retable it. Amendment 11 ANNEX, POINT 5 A (NEW) Annex I, part I, note 2 a (new) (Directive 96/82/EC) In the Notes to Part 1, the following text is added after Note 2: 1. Potassium nitrate (1250/5000) Composite potassium-nitrate based fertilisers composed of potassium nitrate in crystalline form 2. Potassium nitrate (5000/10000) Composite potassium-nitrate based fertilisers composed of potassium nitrate in prilled/granular form Justification Potassium nitrate is used mainly in the agricultural sector and to a lesser extent in the industrial sector with applications ranging from glass and ceramics to textiles and steel. The conditions for storing, handling and processing this compound for agricultural use are similar to those for other fertilisers. The quantities of potassium nitrate involved at these stages are significant. Under the transport regulations potassium nitrate was classified as a division 5.1 oxidising agent in packaging group 3, corresponding to the lowest level of risk. On the basis of tests subsequently carried out by an accredited European institute (TNO Prins Maurits Laboratory, Rijkswijk, Netherlands), potassium nitrate in prilled form (that most commonly used for agricultural purposes) cannot even be classified as an oxidising agent. The Council rejected Amendment 42 adopted by Parliament at first reading, without providing any justification. In view of its scientific basis it is therefore proposed to retable it. Amendment 12 ANNEX, PARAGRAPH 3, POINT (c) (i) Annex I, part 2, Note 1, paragraph 1, indents 3 a and 3 b (new) (Directive 96/82/EC) – Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy 1 ; – Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste 2 . 1 OJ L 327, 27.12.2000, p. 1. 2 OJ L 377, 32.12.1991, p. 20. Directive as last amended by Directive 94/31/EC (OJ L 168, 2.7.1994, p. 28). Justification Reinstatement of amendment 43 adopted in first reading. References to these two directives are essential. The Water framework directive is relevant for the Seveso II Directive especially concerning emissions of certain substances into the aquatic environment. Adding a reference to the Hazardous Waste Directive, allows tailings and waste from mineral processing already classified as hazardous under the EU ‘waste list’ to unequivocally fall under the scope of the Seveso II Directive. This, in turn, allows Aznacóllar-type tailings pond accidents to be covered by Seveso II Directive. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Introduction Your rapporteur welcomes, as a whole, the common position on
