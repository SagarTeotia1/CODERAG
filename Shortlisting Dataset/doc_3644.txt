Question for written answer E-007554/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (29 July 2011) Subject: Reopening of Gournes quarries in the municipality of Hersonissos in the prefecture of Heraklion The reopening of Gournes quarries has profoundly alarmed residents and associations in and around Gournes in the municipality of Hersonissos (prefecture of Heraklion) in Crete who have strongly protested about it. According to reports, the activities previously carried out there included mining involving powerful explosions. It should be noted that, under the decision of the Prefecture of Heraklion (No 1729/2.8.2010), the quarries have a temporary operating licence running up to 16 July 2012, but only for the crushing, cutting, processing and disposal of inert materials that have already been mined; no new materials may be mined. In the past, operations at the quarries have damaged the ecosystem and affected the nearby gorge of Agia Anastasia which contains remarkable fossiliferous rocks, almost buried two wells in the bed of the canyon under the accumulation of inert materials, damaged the historic stalactite cave of Hoirospilios and posed a direct threat of destruction to a number of archaeological sites (the 23rd section of the Inspectorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities has produced a document to this effect). In view of the above and bearing in mind Council Directive 97/11/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain public or private projects on the environment, will the Commission say: 1. Is it aware of complaints about the reopening of Gournes quarries? 2. Does it believe that the reopening of the quarries is in line with Council Directive 97/11/EC? 3. What steps will it take to protect the ecosystem of the area from illegal reopening of the quarries?
