WRITTEN QUESTION E-0889/05 by Michl Ebner (PPE-DE) to the Commission (9 March 2005) Subject: Solvent inks in screen and digital printing Screen and digital printing mainly use solvent-based dyes and inks. These contain certain acetates which, in the long term, are damaging to the respiratory organs. More stringent rules have already been adopted in Germany where ‘eco-solvent’ inks have been introduced. In this case, it is simply the percentage of solvent that has been reduced. A better alternative to solvent inks, however, would be UV-hardening inks, which contain no volatile solvent components. Can the Commission say whether a regulation is being drafted which would prohibit printing presses or inkjet printers using solvent dyes or inks? Can stricter conditions be expected for such firms in the future (enclosure and aspiration, health checks on employees etc.)? Can the Commission say what conditions it intends to introduce? Is there a possibility that solvent inks will be prohibited in the future?
