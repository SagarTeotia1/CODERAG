Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (18 November 2008) In an official statement released on 23 September 2008, the Member of the Commission responsible for Justice, Freedom and Security made it clear that Decree Law No 92 of 23 May 2008 was incompatible with Community law with regard to the provisions relating to the automatic expulsion of Union citizens and to the application of the mechanism of aggravating circumstances to EU citizens. The Commission has held bilateral discussions in which the Commission indicated to the Italian authorities which provisions it deemed to be incompatible with Community law. Following these discussions, Italy informed on 15 October 2008 the Commission that with regard to Decree Law No 92/2008 and Law No 125 of 24 July 2008, the Italian Government would proceed to insert an interpretation provision which would clearly exclude Union citizens from the personal scope of certain provisions of that legislation, inter alia those establishing aggravating circumstances, in line with the Commission's observations regarding the incompatibility of those provisions with Community law. The Commission will seek clarification from the Italian authorities with regard to the timetable for such amendments. With regard to the application of these provisions to third-country nationals, the Commission informs the Honourable Members that there is no Community competence for action in this matter.
