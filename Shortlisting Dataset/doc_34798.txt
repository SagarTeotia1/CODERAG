Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (20 June 2006) Russia has always been a reliable supplier of natural gas to the European Union, in a position of mutually beneficial inter-dependence. Russia, on the one hand, needs the predictability and certainty that the EU market will, in the medium to long term, take the gas that will result from huge new investments. The EU, on the other hand, needs the transparency and certainty that those gas deliveries will be made in a timely fashion. The Commission made it clear, on several occasions, that the rules applied to Gazprom will be no different to those applied to other companies, notably under the competition rules of the EC Treaty, and that they will be applied in exactly the same manner. However, Gazprom is the exclusive exporter of gas from Russia to the EU and this precludes other Russian companies and foreign joint ventures with gas reserves being able to supply directly the EU market. Any analysis, while remaining neutral and non-discriminatory, must take account of this fact. In the ongoing energy dialogue with Russia, the EU has always defended the principle of third party access to export pipelines in Russia.
