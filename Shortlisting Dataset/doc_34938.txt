WRITTEN QUESTION P-2874/05 by Kartika Liotard (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 July 2005) Subject: Possible measures in response to recent research into the carcinogenic properties of aspartame (artificial sweetener) 1. Is the Commission aware of the press release produced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stating that the Authority does not consider it necessary at present to take measures to protect consumers against possible adverse effects of consuming aspartame, although a recent study by the European Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences (B. Ramazinni research centre) seems to suggest that there is a connection between the consumption of aspartame and cancer? 2. Is the Commission aware that, in that press release, EFSA stated that it would take months to study the new research data? Does the Commission agree with EFSA that while the data are being studied, no steps should be taken on the basis of the research by the B. Ramazinni research centre to limit consumption of aspartame, at least temporarily? 3. Does not the Commission agree with me that the findings of the B. Ramazinni centre are so serious, and the risk faced by the millions of consumers of aspartame is accordingly so great, that preventive measures are needed without delay, and that it would therefore not be right to await the results of EFSA's study? If so, what kind of measures can we expect from the Commission?
