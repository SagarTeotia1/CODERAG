Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (9 October 2007) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for his query concerning the Commission's mobility policy. A 50 % contribution to the cost of public transport season tickets for Commission staff was indeed part of the Commission's Mobility Plan for 2006‑09, adopted in March 2006. However, the implementation of this contribution scheme was conditional and dependent on the Commission receiving the necessary funding from the Budgetary Authority. The Council's Budgetary Committee rejected the Commission's request for funding for this initiative in the preliminary draft budget (PDB) 2007 (EUR 2.8 million) and again for 2008 (despite the Commission reducing the amount requested to EUR 2.0 million which would correspond to a 30 % contribution to the cost of season tickets). The Commission has already made efforts to reintroduce a request for funding for 2008 in a proposed amendment to the European Parliament. Although this contribution scheme is only part of the Commission's mobility policy, without it the Commission is unlikely to meet its ambitious goal of reducing the use of private cars by staff in travelling to work from 44 % in 2004 to 35 % in 2009, and at the same time increasing the use of public transport from 38 % to 45 %.
