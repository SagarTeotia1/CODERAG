enable this to be applied gradually and asymmetrically, as necessary, while protecting comparable production sectors on both shores of the Mediterranean, which are more likely to face competition as a result of greater liberalisation; calls on the UfM to select projects mainly according to social and economic and environmental mitigation needs; 13. Underlines the need to establish a regional agricultural policy in line with the Euro-Mediterranean Road Map for Agriculture, to preserve local food production and food security, and to promote production, distribution and diversification of typical Mediterranean products and the development of small and middle farming adapted to sustainable development; in the light of growing food insecurity in many Mediterranean partner countries, calls on the Commission to accept partner requests regarding extended safeguards and quick procedures to implement them in times of food crises; 14. Recognises the importance of strengthening cooperation in the field of energy between the Euro-Mediterranean partners and the need to develop a regional energy market, with a view to the implementation of renewable energy and energy infrastructure projects in the Mediterranean region; urges that sustainable energy and development policies such as the Desertec project should be geared first and foremost to the region and thus contribute to its development; welcomes the UfM’s regional project ‘Mediterranean Solar Plan’, since as well as contributing to the development of infrastructure it will boost the development of the components industry and corresponding engineering and technology in all the countries covered by the plan; 15. Hopes that the association agreements will be reviewed in the light of the new requirements deriving from the financial, economic and social crisis and the food and energy crises; points out that one of the main objectives of creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area must remain that of boosting trade in the service of development and poverty reduction, and hopes that the Road Map adopted at the ministerial summit of 9 December 2009 will help to achieve this objective; 16. Urges the Commission in its trade negotiations to keep up its demands for further development of democracy and human rights from both Libya, which participates in the UfM as an observer State, and from all the member countries of the Union for the Mediterranean; 17.
