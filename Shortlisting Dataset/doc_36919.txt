b) an international agreement pursuant to which the Commission would be obliged to authorise the transfer of such data; one can only regret the ambiguous wording of some of the clauses contained in the Decision and of the appended undertakings (such as those concerning duration, monitoring arrangements, cases in which the Decision may be suspended or withdrawn, the terms and conditions under which the Member States may intervene, etc.), which might give the false impression that obligations could be derived from that text as they are explicitly excluded by clause 47, which stipulates that 'these Undertakings do not create any right or benefit on any person or party, private or public'; As regards substance 1.2. The draft decision is based on 'Undertakings', the binding nature of which is far from proven as regards both: a) the source, which is purely administrative (and therefore subject to possible re-organisations within the Department of Home Security which would make the separations between internal structures obsolete); and b) the substance (since, on the one hand, guarantees are mentioned for which there is as yet no legal basis in the USA and, on the other, the option is kept open of amending the rules at any time, with particular reference to the arrangements for using and re-using the data); 1.3. The 'pull' system for accessing PNR data undermines any limitations that may be agreed and must be replaced by a 'push' system with appropriate filters, 2. Considers the importance of the issue to be such that the European Union should come to an arrangement with the USA on the basis of a proper international agreement which, with due respect for fundamental rights, stipulates: a) the data which could be transferred in an automated way (APIS) and the data which could possibly be transferred on a case-by-case basis, b) the list of the serious crimes in respect of which an additional request could be made, c) the list of authorities and agencies which could share the data and the data-protection conditions to be respected, d) the data-retention period for the two kinds of data, it being clear that data dealing with the prevention of serious crimes have to be exchanged in accordance with the EU-US agreement on judicial cooperation and extradition, e) the role to be played by airlines in transferring passengers' data and the means envisaged (APIS, PNR, etc.) for public-security purposes, f) the guarantees to be offered to passengers in order to enable them to correct the data relating to them or provide an explanation in the event of a discrepancy between the data relating to a travel contract and the data shown in identity documents, visas, passports and so on, g) the airlines' responsibilities vis-à-vis passengers and the public authorities in the event of transcription or encoding errors and as regards protection of the data processed, h) the right to appeal to an independent authority and redress mechanisms in the event of infringements of passengers" rights; 3. Declares itself ready to deal under urgent procedure with an international agreement which complies with the above-mentioned principles;
