Joint answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-4475/06 , E-4606/06 , E-4806/06 , E-4813/06 , E-4802/06 (11 December 2006) Following the statements by Vice-President Verheugen about the need for a change in attitudes within the Commission towards better lawmaking, which is a matter of priority for the Commission, the Honorable Members have put questions to the Commission concerning the proper operation of its decision-making procedures. The President of the Commission has on several occasions stressed the confidence that the Commission has in its staff and the great esteem in which it holds the often highly complex and increasingly demanding work they perform. The Commission therefore regards the unfounded naming of two of its civil servants in Written Question E‑4802/06 by Mr Kilroy-Silk as highly regrettable. The Commission's decisions are taken collectively on a proposal from the Commissioner responsible as the culmination of a process whereby the departments concerned are consulted precisely in order to guarantee this collective principle. This consultation process helps to ensure the consistency and quality of the proposals adopted by the Commission under the procedures in force. The relationship between the Members of the Commission and their respective departments can only be based on integrity, trust and transparency. Where it sees fit, the Commission may apply any of the whole range of measures provided for in the Staff Regulation, even to the point of dismissing a senior official. It therefore considers that its Members have at their disposal all the means they need to exercise their prerogatives and political responsibilities effectively. Lastly, the Commission would point out that it has embarked on a large‑scale exercise of simplifying the acquis communautaire and reducing the administrative burdens placed on businesses and that it will continue working to improve the regulatory environment within the Union, in particular by making impact assessments more rigorous and rendering proposals more consistent with its priorities in the matter of growth and employment.
