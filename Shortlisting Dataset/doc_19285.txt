Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (18 March 2010) Only non euro area Member States have received a financial support from the EU (Hungary, Romania, Latvia). The Heads of State and Government have indicated on 11th February 2010 that euro area Member States will take action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole. They have also noted that the Greek authorities have not requested any financial support.
