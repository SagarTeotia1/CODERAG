Question for written answer E-7859/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (30 September 2010) Subject: Reducing the murder rate in Europe According to a WHO report released yesterday at the ‘Safety 2010’ conference in London, forty young people are murdered every day in Europe in acts of violence. Violence is the third most important cause of deaths in the age group between 10 and 29, accounting for the loss of 15 000 lives every year. Some 40 % of such murders are perpetrated using a knife or other sharp object. Firearms and strangling are also used for purposes of homicide. It is further estimated that for every eight young people killed, another twenty are hospitalised. Given the enormous losses to society arising from juvenile violence in European countries, can the Commission state what programmes it intends to promote in order to improve public health and safety in the Union?
