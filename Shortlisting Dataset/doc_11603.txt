Question for written answer E-000496/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (28 January 2011) Subject: The case of Hector Aleem in Pakistan The Commission may be aware of the case of Hector Aleem, a human rights activist in Pakistan, who founded an NGO named ‘Peace Worldwide’ which seeks to reconcile through peaceful dialogue the Christian/Muslim religious and cultural divide in the country. In the course of his work, Aleem was arrested by Pakistan’s security authorities in Islamabad in 2009 on charges of blasphemy, and was sentenced to a term of seven years’ incarceration. It is widely thought that, by providing a voice for unrepresented Christians locked in a local community property dispute following the demolition of a church in the town of Rawl, Aleem was singled out for false accusation and denunciation by hard-line jihadi group Tehrik-e-sunat. The Commission may in addition be aware that Pakistan’s discriminatory and archaic religious laws on blasphemy (under which Aleem was sentenced) and the Hudood Ordinances have regularly been condemned in European Parliament resolutions. Does the Commission feel that in light of this case (sadly one among many and becoming more frequent) the generous stance of suspending tariffs proposed by the Council after the recent tragedy of the floods is still justified? What more can be done by the EU to improve the poor treatment of religious minority communities in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan?
