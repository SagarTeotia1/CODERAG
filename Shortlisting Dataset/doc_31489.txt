Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (26 October 2011) As mentioned in the reply to Question E‑011183/2010 and E‑005059/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E‑2010-011183&language=EN and http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E‑2011-005059&language=EN respectively , the European Commission is aware that metal theft in general and copper theft in particular is on the rise in a number of Member States. It does not presently have a comprehensive overview of the situation in all Member States. The figures at our disposal indicate that the number of incidents is closely related to the price of copper on the international market and that a major proportion of such crimes is committed by so called ‘mobile (itinerant) criminal groups’. The Commission cooperated closely with the Belgian Presidency of the Council in preparations for the Council Conclusions on itinerant criminal gangs adopted in December 2010 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/118169.pdf . These included the setting up of an informal network of contact points specialised in administrative approaches to preventing certain types of crime, including via public private partnerships and cooperation between administrative and law enforcement bodies. The network was established on 28 September 2011 and will help the exchange of best practices between Member States in preventing metal theft, for example by awareness raising campaigns with scrap dealers and their professional associations, by introducing the principle of ‘know your customer’ when copper is sold or bought by scrap dealers or by introducing a system of certificates. Crime committed by mobile itinerant criminal gangs is also identified as one of the 8 priorities under the multi-annual ‘Harmony policy cycle http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/117583.pdf ’ on serious international and organised crime, which aims to tackle the most important criminal threats in a coherent and methodological manner through optimum cooperation between the relevant services of the Member States, EU institutions and EU Agencies, as well as relevant third countries and organisations.
