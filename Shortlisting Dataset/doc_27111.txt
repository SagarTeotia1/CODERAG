Question for written answer E-008927/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jörg Leichtfried (S&D) (7 October 2011) Subject: Legal requirement to label textiles trimmed with fur In May 2011 the European Parliament adopted a regulation on the labelling of textiles which will in future make it compulsory by law in the EU to indicate on the labelling of textiles that they contain components of animal origin, such as fur. 1. What is the Commission's timeframe for the implementation of the proposed legislative act? 2. Does the Commission intend, as called for by animal welfare organisations (such as ‘Four Paws’), to require furs to be labelled in as complete a way as possible, including the details: (a) country of origin, (b) conditions in which animals are kept, and (c) species of animal?
