Question for written answer E-010693/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Christel Schaldemose (S&D) (21 November 2011) Subject: EU flower label I am aware that the Commission is considering extending the use of the EU’s eco-label, the ‘EU flower’, to cover foodstuffs. I am also aware that the Commission has had a study carried out on the advantages and drawbacks of doing this. I am glad to support the Commission in its wish to increase the number of products using the EU’s health and safety labels. But as the study of the drawbacks highlights, we risk confusing European consumers if we place on our foods labels that are familiar from other areas. In the light of the above, I should like to ask the Commission if it has considered taking a different route, namely seeking to extend the use of the EU’s organic label on foods, instead of introducing the EU flower in this area?
