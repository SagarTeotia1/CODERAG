Question for written answer E-003884/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Cristiana Muscardini (PPE) (19 April 2011) Subject: Committee of inquiry into refugee massacre in the Mediterranean The vessel left Tripoli on the night of 22/23 March with 335 Sub-Saharan refugees on board, including women and children, most of them Ethiopian and Eritrean. A few hours later it disappeared without trace. One of the passengers had sounded the alarm by contacting the agency Habeshia and the international humanitarian organisation EveryOne, which called on the international authorities to search the waters concerned and asked the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to intervene. On 6 April EveryOne received news that the bodies of the migrants were being ‘washed ashore, riddled with bullets’. It seems that the vessel was attacked in the Mediterranean. What happened remains unclear but light needs to be shed on the matter as soon as possible to determine how the tragedy occurred and who was responsible. 1. Will the Commission set up a European committee of inquiry, in cooperation with the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission in Geneva, with a view to shedding light on this incident? 2. Does it not think that Europe's failure to take part in the patrolling of the international waters between Italy and Libya is deplorable, bearing in mind also the latest tragedy to occur on 5 April involving a boat carrying 200 refugees, of whom only 47 survived? 3. Given the continuous flow of migrants from North Africa, including in the wake of the conflict in Libya, does it not think that rescue services and advanced surveillance systems should be put in place to make it possible to respond to SOS calls and help vessels in distress? 4. What role did the Frontex agency play during the tragic events in recent weeks? 5. When will Europe as a whole take responsibility for these massive and tragic migratory flows?
