9999/C Q999 E/095 WRITTEN QUESTION E-4083/03 by Bob van den Bos (ELDR) and Johanna Boogerd-Quaak (ELDR) to the Commission (22 December 2003) Subject: Burma The human rights situation in Burma is still appalling. 1. The US Administration has now passed a law prohibiting new investment in Burma. The EU has taken no economic measures to date. While European firms are discouraged from investing in Burma, European firms continue to operate there (for example the French multinational TotalFinaElf). Their activities provide a source of income for the junta. Is the Commission prepared to impose a ban on joint ventures with Burmese state concerns and to deny access to the EU market for products resulting from such cooperation between European firms and Burmese state concerns? If so, when and how does it intend to do so? If not, why not? 2. Arms are being supplied to Burma on a large scale. It would appear that these arms come from ten or so countries, including Russia, India, China, Israel and Ukraine. Given that the EU has in the recent past been able to prevent the supply of arms to Bosnia, is the Commission prepared to attempt to do the same regarding arms supplies from the above countries? If so, how does it intend to do so? If not, why not?
