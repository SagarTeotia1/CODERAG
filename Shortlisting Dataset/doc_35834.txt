Supplementary answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (30 January 2008) The Commission has received information on this case from the Spanish authorities at the end of July 2007 and in September 2007. The information shows that the new combined-cycle power plant Cristóbal Colon IV in Huelva has been in operation since 13 November 2006, replacing three old power plants. The Commission is currently assessing the information provided by Spain in order to determine if the combustion plant is a new installation, as defined in the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control. , and to determine the compliance with the requirements for an environmental permit in this Directive. Depending on the results of the assessment, the Commission will take all necessary measures, including if needed infringement proceedings as the case may be pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty, in order to ensure full compliance with the relevant provisions of Community Law.
