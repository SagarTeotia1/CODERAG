Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (15 January 2010) The Commission is aware of the material which can be used for the construction of noise barriers and for filtering harmful nitrogen dioxide and particles from the air. In fact a pilot demonstration has been made through EUR 1.2 million co-financed by the European Union in the 2006 LIFE project SPAS http://www.life-spas.at/ ending 2009. Some initial results were presented at the second international congress ‘FINE!DustFree’ in Klagenfurt am Worthersee in October 2009 where the Commission also participated. Regarding the possible support from the European Union the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that there are funds available (LIFE+, FP7 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/index.htm ; http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html ) for projects to further develop and demonstrate innovative technological solutions such as the filtrating noise barrier. The proposals are assessed on their technical merits according to the prevailing financial rules. In addition, the Member States can use other EU funding such as the structural and cohesion funds to facilitate the wider introduction of these solutions in their territory.
