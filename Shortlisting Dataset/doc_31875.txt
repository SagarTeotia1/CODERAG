WRITTEN QUESTION E-3768/07 by Bert Doorn (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (20 July 2007) Subject: Expert panel on monitoring reduction of the administrative burden in the EU The European Commission is currently establishing, at the request of the European Parliament under Item 26 01 08 of the EU budget, an independent panel of experts to monitor the quality of opinions delivered by the IAB by means of spot checks, notably as regards the charting of unnecessary administrative burdens, and to supervise the implementation of the European action programme to reduce administrative burdens. This independent panel would bring much-needed expertise and objectivity to the impact assessment process in general and to the administrative burden reduction programme in particular. Much of the added-value of the expert panel will depend on the expertise of its members. Considering that the European Commission has been rather silent on the timetable and composition of the expert panel, could it please answer the following questions: — Could the European Commission indicate the timetable within which the independent expert panel is supposed to be up and running? — Does the European Commission agree that the expert panel would bring the most added-value in terms of objectivity and expertise to the administrative burden reduction process if it were composed of members of national administrative burden units from the Member States, such as the Nationaler Normenkontrollrat (Germany), the Better Regulation Commission (United Kingdom) and the Dutch Advisory Board on Administrative Burden (the Netherlands)?
