ORAL QUESTION H-0270/07 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Diamanto Manolakou to the Council Subject: Attack on basic democratic rights in Bulgaria The Bulgarian parliament recently decided to set up a special nine-member committee to examine the archives of the State Security Bureau during the period of socialist rule. According to its chairman, the committee's main priority will be to examine and publish the records of all candidates in future European elections, together with those of public figures, politicians, public officials, judges and journalists. The prospect that this information will be used for anti-democratic proceedings, discrimination and intimidation is arousing great indignation. What is the Council's position on this anti-democratic behaviour by a Member State? Does it agree with these measures, which are clear violations of the freedom of thought and expression and introduce the principle that citizens may be punished for the political and ideological opinions they hold?
