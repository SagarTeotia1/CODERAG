Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (17 March 2011) 3 December has been proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly as the International Day of Persons with disabilities. This annual day is intended to increase awareness and understanding of disability issues and trends and to mobilise support for practical action at all levels by, with and for people with disabilities. Since 2003 the Commission together with the European Disability Forum marks the International Day of Disabled People by organising a policy conference as part of the EU's wider efforts to promote the mainstreaming of disability issues in all relevant EU policies, and more recently enshrined in the EU Disability Strategy 2010‑20 COM(2010)636 ‘A renewed commitment to a barrier-free Europe’, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010DC0636:EN:NOT . The Commission pays due attention to the specific needs of people with different types of disabilities — being physical, sensory, mental and intellectual — throughout its legislative and policy initiatives. However, it believes that it is important to keep a combined major annual awareness-raising event with a strong focus on the rights of all persons with disabilities in Europe and on the various barriers that they face in their everyday lives. Rights of persons who have lost limbs and the barriers that they face for instance in their personal mobility or in their access to employment and healthcare have been dealt with in previous European day of people with disabilities conferences, and the Commission will continue to do so.
