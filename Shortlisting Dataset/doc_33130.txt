European Union, a fine should be imposed on the Member State responsible for such misrepresentation. (6) In order to supplement the rules on calculation of the fines against manipulation of statistics as well as on the procedure to be followed by the Commission for the investigation of such actions, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of detailed criteria for establishing the amount of the fine and for conducting the investigations to be carried out by the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and Council. (7) In the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact, the adjustment and adherence to the medium-term budgetary objective should be ensured through an obligation to lodge an interest-bearing deposit temporarily imposed on a Member State whose currency is the euro that is making insufficient progress with budgetary consolidation. This should be the case when ▌a Member State , even with a deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value, deviates significantly from the medium-term budgetary objective or the appropriate adjustment path towards it and fails to correct the deviation . (8) The interest-bearing deposit imposed should be released to the Member State concerned together with the interest accrued on it once the Council has been satisfied that the situation giving rise to the obligation to lodge that deposit has come to an end. (9) In the corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact, sanctions for Member States whose currency is the euro should take the form of an obligation to lodge a non-interest-bearing deposit linked to a Council decision establishing the existence of an excessive deficit when an interest bearing deposit has already been imposed on the Member State concerned in the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact or in cases of particularly serious non-compliance with the legal budgetary policy obligations laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact, and the obligation to pay a fine in the event of non-compliance with a Council recommendation to correct an excessive government deficit. ▌ (9a) In order to avoid the sanctions under the preventive part of the Stability and Growth Pact foreseen under this Regulation, to be applied retroactively, said sanctions should in any case only apply in respect of the relevant recommendations adopted by the Council under the fourth subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 adopted after the entry into force of this Regulation. Likewise, in order to avoid the sanctions under the corrective part of the Stability and Growth pact laid down in this Regulation to be applied retroactively, said measures should in any case only apply in respect of the relevant recommendations and decisions to correct an excessive government deficit adopted by the Council after the entry into
