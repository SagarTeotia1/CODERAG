creation of trade capacities that fall within the ambit of AfT must be accompanied by more effective efforts to ensure decent producer remuneration; in this connection recalls the importance of producer participation in the setting of prices, as envisaged in the Compendium of the Cotonou Agreement; The principles of the EU's Aid for Trade 47. Stresses that the 2007 Joint European Strategy on AfT, in line with the OECD Paris Declaration, should establish the following general principles: As regards rationale and geographical scope (a) AfT is no panacea for development but is indeed a necessary complement to trade liberalisation and domestic policy reforms carried out by developing countries themselves, and to appropriate WTO flexibilities, b) a successful AfT requires the effective integration of trade and development strategies, (c) AfT should prioritise the LDCs and the most vulnerable developing countries, As regards the Doha Development Agenda (d) AfT is not a substitute for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations and the development benefits that will result from improved market access; AfT is a valuable and necessary complement, which should contribute to the development dimension of the DDA by helping developing countries, particularly the LDCs, to implement and benefit from WTO agreements and more broadly by helping them to expand their trade; AfT is not part of the DDA single undertaking and is necessary in its own right, independently of progress in the Doha Round, e) increased and more effective AfT should be expeditiously implemented regardless of the conclusion of the Doha Round, (f) AfT cannot be linked to any outcome of the negotiations or used to compensate for a lack of market access, As regards the commitments for more Aid for Trade and its implementation g) increased AfT must be proportional to the magnitude of the identified challenges, predictable, stable and complementary to − but not replace − existing development aid, h) greater coherence with the different areas of external action, particularly trade and development policies, as well as greater complementarity and better harmonisation, alignment and coordination of procedures, both between the EU and its Member States and in relations with and between other donors are essential to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of AfT, i) country ownership is crucial: AfT must be recipient-driven and be designed and implemented as an integral part of developing countries' own economic and developmental strategies and must be responsive to the demands of the private sector and civil society, including the Fair Trade movement, (j) AfT should be pursued following a differentiated approach depending on specific development contexts and needs, so that beneficiary countries or regions, and particularly their private sectors and civil society, are provided with specific, tailor-made assistance, based on their own needs, strategies, priorities and assets, k) in view of the recurring problem of the lack of ownership of needs assessments by developing countries, due to a lack of capacity in some cases, AfT should support developing countries in the management, design and implementation of trade policies as an integral part of their own economic and developmental strategies; AfT should also be designed to
