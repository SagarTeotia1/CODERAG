Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (21 September 2007) As indicated in the question, in December 2006 the Commission launched a wide-ranging public consultation with stakeholders on the Green Paper: Global Europe — Europe's Trade Defence Instruments in a changing global economy COM(2006)763. which ended in early April 2007. This was the largest public consultation to date on the functioning of the European Union's TDIs (Trade Defence Instruments) and was conducted in a fully transparent and open manner. Of the more than 540 replies received, all (except those few requesting confidentiality) have been posted on the external website of Directorate-General responsible for Trade (DG TRADE). Furthermore, in order to support the active contribution of stakeholders in the ongoing public consultation, in mid‑March 2007 the Commission also organised a public hearing with the participation of several hundred interested parties. The verbatim transcript of the hearing was published on the external website of DG TRADE. As has been stated on numerous occasions by the Commission, most recently on 16 July 2007 by the Deputy Director-General of DG TRADE at the public hearing organised by the INTA Committee on International Trade. Committee of the Parliament, the follow-up to the Green Paper consultation aims at strengthening consensus among Member States concerning the application of TDI. The Commission is in the process of examining all the contributions it has received and will produce a communication with the assessment of the public consultation, including the follow-up proposals. According to current planning this communication will be made public in the last quarter of 2007. The changes that the Commission is examining will form a realistic, pragmatic and balanced proposal, reflecting the diverse interests and legitimate sensitivities of stakeholders and Member States, as expressed during the public consultation process.
