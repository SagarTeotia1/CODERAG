WRITTEN QUESTION E-4046/05 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 November 2005) Subject: Quarrying in national parks Is there any European money available for the purchasing of quarrying rights, and how is it obtained? Furthermore, I understand that several European countries have a policy of not allowing quarrying within national parks. Has it ever been the case that these quarries have received old permissions that needed to be revoked? Do any of the national parks allow quarrying even for restoration of old buildings, and do they allow any of their stone to be exported?
