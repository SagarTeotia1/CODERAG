but emphasises in the strongest possible terms that only 2-3% of EU agricultural land is currently being used for this kind of production and media reports blaming biofuels for the current food crisis are exaggerated as far as the EU is concerned; agrees, however, that the policy in countries such as the United States of assigning more land for maize growing to produce bioethanol has had a knock-on effect on the price and availability of maize and other cereals on the global food market; 20. Calls on the Commission and the Member States, nevertheless, to do more to promote the use and production of second-generation bioenergy which processes manure and agricultural waste materials, rather than primary agricultural products; 21. Stresses in particular that high priority should be given to collecting municipal waste and agricultural and forest residues and converting them into gas; points out that this would allow appropriate technologies to be developed and give time to study the compatibility of food and energy production; 22. Notes with serious concern that the cost of compound feed has risen by EUR 75 per tonne and is continuing to rise, owing to an acute shortage of feed grains, and that this represents an additional cost of EUR 15 billion to the EU livestock industry; 23. Considers that the current crisis demands an immediate and thorough discussion among the EU institutions and the Member States on the role that modern biotechnology can play in ensuring the continued production of food at reasonable prices; Better development policies 24. Considers that a genuine fight against hunger requires a global sustainable development policy in order to enable developing countries to produce and supply their population with sufficient water and food; 25. Supports developing countries in their endeavours to secure access to food for their local populations; believes that viable policy space must be further strengthened to allow for national rules and measures for the development of this sector; considers Malawi to be a positive example of a developing country where food production has been doubled in the last three years, and underlines that the EU is playing a role in supporting this development; calls on the Commission to provide assistance with making this phenomenon known, so that it can be taken as an example in other developing countries; 26. Calls on the EU Member States and the international community to meet the extraordinary emergency appeal of the WFP as a matter of urgency and to assist it in facing up to the new challenges in the fight against hunger; considers, nevertheless, that dependence on food aid operations needs to be reduced, and stresses, therefore, the need for mid- and long-term action to prevent more damaging consequences and to tackle the root causes of this crisis; 27. Calls for an urgent and substantial increase in investment in agriculture, aquaculture, rural development and agribusinesses in developing countries, focused on poor farmers and small-scale farming based on agro-ecological food production systems; recalls that 75% of the world's poor population lives in rural areas, but that only 4% of official development assistance
