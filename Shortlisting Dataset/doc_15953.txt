WRITTEN QUESTION P-4236/07 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (29 August 2007) Subject: Request for the immediate activation of the Community civil protection mechanism and the Solidarity Fund for Greece The fires that have broken out throughout the summer in Greece and other EU Member States, particularly in southern Europe, have caused an unprecedented ecological disaster. In Greece alone, it is estimated that thousands of fires have destroyed around 120 000 hectares of forest since the start of June, as well as crops, livestock and homes, and have claimed a number of lives. As of 27 August 2007, the country has been mourning dozens of people killed in 170 criminal fires. Given the large scale of the disaster and the emergency situation in several Greek regions, can the Commission answer the following questions: Have the Greek authorities requested the immediate activation of the Community civil protection mechanism and the Solidarity Fund? What is the Commission's estimate of the damage caused by this year's fires in Greece and of the amount of Community compensation? Is it possible that farmers affected by the fires could receive compensation from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)? According to what timescale will the Community authorities be paying compensation?
