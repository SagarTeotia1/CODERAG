Niels Busk (ALDE, DK), believes this is unrealistic and intends to table an amendment calling for a figure of €360 million. Preference for fresh produce, grown in Europe The draft report also calls for the practical arrangements for the programme to be clarified. MEPs say it should cover only fruit and vegetables produced within the EU and only fresh produce, since processed products have less nutritional value. The fruit and vegetables should meet the highest quality standards and should preferably be seasonal varieties, grown locally. Priority should be given to sustainable production. The report also suggests that the programme not be restricted to children at school in the 6-10 age group but should also be available to pre-school children. In addition, MEPs want the fruit to be accompanied by health and dietary advice in an appropriate style for children.

The committee proposes clarifications, and more flexibility for Member States, whilst urging them not to "steal" brains from third countries and reaffirming the "Community preference" principle. The Blue Card, proposed by the European Commission, is designed to attract highly-qualified workers from third countries by giving them access to the 27 Member States. This card would not replace existing national systems, but would provide an additional channel of attraction, with a common grant procedure. Most highly-skilled migrants prefer destinations such as the USA, Australia or Canada to the EU, due to the fragmentation of EU labour markets. The "Blue Card" would enable holders who have spent three years in a first EU country of residence to access other Member States thereafter. The card would therefore normally be valid for three years, renewable for a further two years. If a worker's contract is for a shorter duration, then the card should be granted for the duration of the contract plus three months, say MEPs in the committee. Who should be eligible for a Blue Card? In a consultation report drafted by Ewa Klamt (EPP-ED, DE) in co-operation with the Employment Committee the Civil Liberties Committee MEPs seek to clarify Blue Card eligibility requirements: an applicant must have found a job in the EU, and have at least five years' experience in the sector concerned or a university qualification recognised by the Member State. The applicant's contract must guarantee an income of at least 1.7 times the average gross salary in the Member State of residence, add
