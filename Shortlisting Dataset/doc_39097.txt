Question for written answer E-6047/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Anna Rosbach (EFD) (27 July 2010) Subject: True condition of oil rigs in the North Sea On 12 July 2010, the Berlingske Tidende newspaper http://www.berlingske.dk/verden/bp-anklages-svigt-i-nordsoeen reported that a number of oil rigs in the North Sea are in a deplorable technical condition, and that there is a real risk of an oil leak such as that which has already occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. Can the European Commission make a statement on the condition of the different oil rigs in the North Sea or, if not, does it intend to draft such a statement? How many platforms are suffering from serious damage caused, inter alia, by rust, and how many platforms have had their life-span extended beyond the anticipated date? Is it also correct that the poor state of the pipes is caused, inter alia , by bacteria attacking them from the inside?
