WRITTEN QUESTION E-2498/04 by Joseph Muscat (PSE) to the Commission (18 October 2004) Subject: European City Guide SL A number of Maltese businesses and citizens are complaining that, after subscribing for ‘free’ space with a company called European City Guide, they are receiving requests for payments from the same company. This company was reported to have been fined and closed for one year. However, it seems that their practices persist. Will the Commission consider asking the Spanish Government to take the measures required to ensure that such practices adopted by companies like the European City Guide SL will not persist? Will the Commission take any further steps itself?
