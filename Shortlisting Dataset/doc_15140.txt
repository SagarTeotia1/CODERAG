Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (16 July 2010) The Commission acknowledges the importance of the impact of the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland on the air transport industry. It promoted urgent and coordinated action at European level notably through its information note dated 27 April 2010 http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010- 2014/kallas/headlines/news/2010/04/doc/information_note_volcano_crisis.pdf . A number of actions have been undertaken in line with the conclusions of the extraordinary Transport Ministers Council which was organised by the Spanish Presidency on 4 May 2010. They include an update and an improvement of the risk assessment and risk management in such crises as well as the planned definition of binding limit values, defining the safety envelope of engines and aircraft as regards the risk of volcanic ashes as well as more structural measures, notably additional research on the effects of volcanic ashes on aircraft, the acceleration of the Single European Sky, the application of the Air Passenger Rights legislation and the development of a pan-European mobility plan applicable in case of crises. In the framework of these actions, the Commission considers favourably initiatives such as the proposed development of on-board systems which could possibly help to better localise ash clouds.
