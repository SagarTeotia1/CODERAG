appropriately. It must be able to secure its supply lines and conduct long-range patrols with armoured vehicles, helicopters (including transport and attack helicopters) and reconnaissance planes; (f) EUFOR must be considered as a ‘bridging force’ with a temporary mandate. A clear exit strategy must therefore be defined before the deployment begins, which should foresee the replacement of EUFOR by a successor operation (AU, UN or a hybrid force) in order to provide for the successful conclusion of its mandate and the timely return of the troops committed; 3. Underlines that its final approval of the operation will be subject to its being kept fully informed of the different phases in the preparation of the operation (Crisis Management Concept, Joint Action, Concept of Operations, Operation Plan and Force Generation Process); 4. Regrets that this ESDP operation cannot be conducted, for many reasons, from the newly established operations centre of the European Union in Brussels; hopes that this situation will change with the new Reform Treaty, which should make ESDP more efficient; 5. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Presidents, Governments and Parliaments of Chad, CAR and Sudan.
