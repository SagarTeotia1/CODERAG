Question for written answer E-8400/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Proinsias De Rossa (S&D) (14 October 2010) Subject: Roaming charges at sea Passengers on ferries operating between Ireland and Britain or France that are close to shore can access mobile phone networks based in those countries and thus are covered by EU‑wide legislation regulating roaming charges. Ferry passengers further from shore can make mobile calls and send or receive texts using a satellite service provided by a Norwegian company. This service is not covered by EU roaming legislation and therefore mobile phone companies’ roaming charges for using this service are considerably more than on land. Has the Commission considered issuing a proposal to extend EU roaming legislation to such services?
