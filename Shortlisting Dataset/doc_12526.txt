Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (27 November 2009) The Commission would like to highlight that it welcomes measures adopted by Member States in order to promote access of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to public procurement. In fact, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to its publication on 25 June 2008 of the European Code of Best practices facilitating access for SMEs to public procurement contracts http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/key-docs_en.htm#code in the context of the implementation of the ‘Small Business Act’ for Europe (SBA) adopted in June 2008 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/small-business-act/index_en.htm . This Code refers to measures that Member States can adopt in order to facilitate access of SMEs to public contracts. Such measure may include for instance, tendering of contracts into lots, making use of the possiblity to conclude framework agreements with several economic operators and not with a single supplier, taking advantage from the possiblity of economic operators to group together in order to bid for a contract, guaranteeing that selection critera are kept proportionate as requested by the procurement Directives. The Commission encourages the dissemination of these best practices among Member States and will undertake specific actions in 2010 in this regards through the Enterprise Europe Network. However, it should be stated that any measures adopted by Hungarian authorities in order to promote participation of Hungarian SMEs in public procurement tenders, which would discriminate against large or non-Hungarian companies, would not be compatible with EC public procurement rules. Member States efforts to promote access of SMEs to procurement cannot entail a violation of the principle of non discrimination; notably, there can be no discrimination between tenderers by reason of their size or nationality. The principle of non discrimination between tenderers arises from the EC Treaty itself as interpreted by the European Court of Justice, and it underpins the Community Directives on public procurement (both Directive 2004/18/EC on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, and Directive 2004/17/EC coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors).
