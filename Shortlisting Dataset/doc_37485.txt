WRITTEN QUESTION P-0373/06 by Sebastiano Musumeci (UEN) to the Commission (1 February 2006) Subject: New immigration emergency in the Mediterranean During a recent meeting, Libyan leader Gadaffi and Italian Minister of the Interior Pisanu expressed concern at the emergency situation caused by immigration, in particular since a new front emerged in Morocco, from which large numbers of migrants are converging on Libya in addition to the traditional flows. This would seem to be due to the strengthening of the barriers protecting the Spanish towns of Ceuta and Melilla. Last year more than 15000 illegal immigrants arrived on the coasts of Sicily and hundreds more died during the sea journey, causing the local authorities huge difficulties. The estimates for this year are alarming, according to reports from the governments in Tripoli and Rome. Given the above, will the Commission provide answers to the following: Does it consider the problem of illegal immigration to be a purely Italian issue? Or is it not an emergency which the European Union should be responsible for tackling? What measures does it intend to take immediately, outside its medium- and long-term objectives, to put a stop to this human tragedy which is taking place on Europe's seas and coasts and which has now taken on intolerable proportions?
