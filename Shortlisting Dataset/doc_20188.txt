ORAL QUESTION H-0253/10 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Justas Vincas Paleckis to the Commission Subject: Electronic cigarettes Parents in a number of EU Member States are concerned that electronic cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine inhalers, are apparently becoming increasingly available among schoolchildren. These cigarettes are particularly dangerous for children, who become addicted more quickly than adults do. Large doses of nicotine can be highly poisonous. Children can easily get hold of these electronic cigarettes, which are sold online. On ordinary cigarette packets there are warnings about the health dangers of smoking and it is clearly stated that cigarettes can only be purchased by those over the age of 18. Other restrictions also apply, and this is not the case for electronic cigarettes. Does the Commission think it is about time steps were taken to put an end to the distribution of these electronic cigarettes on the internet, and does it think other action should be taken to protect the health of minors?
