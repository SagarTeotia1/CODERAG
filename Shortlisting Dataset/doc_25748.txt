WRITTEN QUESTION E-2566/10 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Anti-dumping duties on Greek peach compote In 1998 New Zealand imposed anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties on peach compote exports originating from Greece and other EU Member States. It removed the anti-subsidy duties in October 2009, but decided to extend anti-dumping duties to peach compote imports of Greek origin. What measures has the Commission taken vis-à-vis the New Zealand authorities to ensure that the anti-dumping duties they have imposed on the products of an EU Member State are lifted?
