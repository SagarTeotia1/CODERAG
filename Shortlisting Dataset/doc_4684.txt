Question for written answer E-003813/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (20 April 2011) Subject: Use of cloning technology to produce human breast milk According to the ‘Vima’ web page of 4 April 2011, Chinese scientists have been producing human breast milk from genetically modified cows using cloning technology to fold human genes into the DNA of Holstein cattle embryos. The genetically modified embryos were then grafted into surrogate dams. The scientists claim that this method has enabled them to breed cows producing milk containing the same proteins as human breast milk! However, this new area of research, which is being carried out with the help of a large biotechnology company, has already encountered opposition on the part of organisations opposed to genetically modified foods. Representatives of these organisations and animal rights bodies have expressed doubts regarding the safety of milk from genetically modified cows as well as raising human and animal health issues. However, the research leader, Professor Ning Li, has insisted that the milk from genetically modified cows is as safe as the ‘conventional’ kind, aside from having a more pronounced flavour. He went on to indicate that, while certain aspects of the study were to be exploited commercially in the next three years, the large scale production of ‘human milk’ would take 10 years or more. In view of this: 1. Has the Commission been following these developments and is it therefore able to assess the reliability of the results obtained from the bioethical point of view and with regard to any adverse consequences of such interference with nature? 2. Does it consider that this method could help provide an answer to the inability of many mothers to breastfeed, given the nutritional value of breast milk, for which the ‘sweetened’ alternatives currently available are not an adequate substitute?
