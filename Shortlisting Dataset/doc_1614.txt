Question for written answer E-5226/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Fiorello Provera (EFD) (8 July 2010) Subject: Human rights standards of the Palestinian Authority's civil police force In June 2008 Human Rights Watch urged international donors to make concrete efforts to end serious abuses by Palestinian security forces. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, warned that donors such as the EU ‘should condition their aid on concrete steps to end politically motivated arrests, torture, and other serious violations that have increased over the past year’. In July of the same year Human Rights Watch released a report criticising both Hamas and Fatah for ‘arrest and detention practices that routinely violate Palestinian and international human rights law’. The EU is the Palestinian Authority’s largest donor. It funds the multi-million euro project entitled EU Police Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support, or EUPOL COPPS. The project advises and assists the civil police, coordinates international assistance to the police and gives advice on criminal justice. What measures is the Commission taking to ensure that the money designated for the Palestinian Authority’s civil police force is used in full compliance with international human rights standards?
