Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (25 November 2005) The overall objective of the project is to prevent and fight marginalisation and foster a mechanism for improving access to and quality of education for disadvantaged groups, with a special focus on the Roma minority. The project’s purpose is to create a mechanism to increase school participation of children from disadvantaged groups in mainstream education and improve their school performance by: — improving the conditions for their pre-school education; — stimulating children from disadvantaged groups to succeed in compulsory education (prevention of drop out) and improve school success rate; and — stimulating the enrolment in the second chance programmes at the primary and secondary level (correction of drop out). There is no specific deadline of 1 September 2005 for the project to be attained. It is due to be finalised in May 2007. At this moment, the project has the following outcomes: — training was carried out for school inspectorates and local partners to develop strategies for improved access and quality of education for children belonging to disadvantaged groups; — the evaluation of applications was finalised in June 2005 and 11 country contracts are already signed. Three other contracts are being prepared; — about 300 persons participated in training activities during the summer holiday: school inspectors, school directors and community representatives on one side and teacher trainers on the other; — the curricula for second chance programme at the primary school level were developed and for the lower secondary education revised. The implementation of the project is timely. However, it is currently too early to make any evaluation of the results but the Commission does believe that the programme is on the right track.
