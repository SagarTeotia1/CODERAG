Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (24 April 2008) To answer the question put by the Honourable Member, it is important to know whether the members of the board of directors of the Spanish golf club have a work contract and receive remuneration or not. If they do indeed have a work contract and receive remuneration, they can be regarded as exercising a professional activity falling within the provisions of Community law on the free movement of workers. In that case, a decision by a Spanish golf club to limit the membership of its board of directors either to Spanish nationals or to Spanish residents appears to be contrary to Community law. In accordance with Article 39 of the EC Treaty and Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community, OJ L 257, 19.10.1968. , which provides for the free movement of workers, EU citizens have a right to take up an activity as employed persons and to pursue such an activity in all Member States without being discriminated against on grounds of nationality in respect of employment, remuneration and other working conditions. This right to non-discrimination on grounds of nationality also applies to rules which, unless they are objectively justified and proportionate to their aim, are intrinsically liable to affect migrant workers more than national workers and consequently risk placing migrant workers at a particular disadvantage Case C‑63/86 Commission v Italy [ECR 1988] I‑29, Case C‑237/94 O'Flynn [ECR 1996] I‑2617. . Rules requiring residence in the host Member State are therefore likely to affect migrant workers more than national workers. It should be recalled that it is for the national authorities and courts to apply the EU rules, including the judgments of the European Court of Justice, on the free movement of workers.
