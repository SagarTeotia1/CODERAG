The first was the death of former Spanish MEP Antoni Gutiérrez Díaz, a one-time vice-president of Parliament and chair of the Regional Committee. "Politics has lost one of its best representatives", said Mr Borrell. The House observed a minute's silence in memory of Mr Gutiérrez Díaz. The second tragic story was the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya . The EP should pay its respects to this journalist for her great bravery, said Mr Borrell, and send its condolences to her family. The President asked the House to observe a minute's silence in memory of Anna Politkovskaya and other journalists imprisoned unjustly or murdered around the world. Mr Borrell reported that Cecilia Malmström (ALDE, SE) had been appointed European Affairs Minister in the Swedish government and would therefore vacate her seat in the European Parliament. -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 PBR-ITEM DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061010BRI11531 FULL-TEXT DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061010BRI11531 ITEM-COVER-EN DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061010BRI11531 ITEM-002-EN DOC XML V0//EN Fundamental rights Postponement of final vote on new Fundamental Rights Agency 2006-10-13 - 10:35 The European Parliament decided to postpone the final vote on the reports by Kinga GÁL (EPP-ED, HU) and Magda KOSANE KOVACS (PES, HU) on the establishment of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency to signal that it insists the scope of the new body to be extended to intergovernmental cooperation in policing, justice, immigration and counter-terrorism issues. MEPs adopted, by a large majority, amendments to the initial proposals of the European Commission but postponed the final vote on the legislative resolutions of the reports, deciding to refer both reports back to the Civil Liberties Committee for reconsideration. The rapporteurs proposed that the final vote be postponed in order to give more time to the European Commission in consultations with the Council to reach an eventual compromise. The European Commission proposed that the agency should deal not only with first pillar issues but also third pillar ones
