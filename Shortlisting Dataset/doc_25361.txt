WRITTEN QUESTION E-3322/09 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Council (7 May 2009) Subject: ‘Parliamentary elections’ in Turkish-occupied Cyprus The National Unity Party under the leadership of Derviş Eroğlu won the parliamentary elections of 19 April 2009 in the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus, taking 44.16 % of the vote and 26 seats, giving him an absolute majority. Despite the statements by Commissioner Rehn’s spokesperson that the Commission did not consider that the outcome of the elections that had taken place the previous day in Turkish-occupied Cyprus would have a direct impact on the progress of negotiations for a solution to the Cyprus problem, it clearly impedes efforts to reach a mutually acceptable and viable solution as part of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. It should also be noted that, after his victory, Derviş Eroğlu declared that he supported any solution which recognised ‘two peoples, two States and two republics’. In view of the above, will the Council say: what measures does it intend to take to put pressure on Mr Eroğlu's party to join efforts to find a solution as part of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation? Which measures does it intend to take in respect of Turkey which is continuing to refuse to open its ports and airports to the Republic of Cyprus, a stance which is encouraging extensive right-wing circles in the occupied part of the island?
