Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (4 December 2009) The Honourable Member refers to the corporate tax provision which allows Spanish companies to amortize goodwill arising from acquiring shares in non-Spanish companies. The Commission informs the Honourable Member that it adopted a negative decision on 28 October 2009, requesting Spain to abolish the contested measure as regards the acquisitions in Member States See press release IP/09/1601. . Indeed, the Commission concluded that the scheme constitutes state aid as it provides selective advantages to Spanish companies engaged in acquiring non-Spanish European companies, as compared to Spanish companies acquiring shares in other Spanish companies. As regards the recovery issue, due to the existence of legitimate expectations, the Commission ordered Spain to recover any incompatible aid granted as from the date the Commission decision to initiate the formal investigation was published on the Official Journal OJ C 311, 21.12.2007. . As regards the acquisitions in third countries, the Commission will continue its investigation. For the information of the Honourable Member, the decision adopted on 28 October 2009 (case C 45/2007) will be published on the Commission website State aid case register can be found in: http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/register/ and the case C 45/2007 in: http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/register/ii/by_case_nr_c2007_0030.html#45 once all confidential information has been removed and will subsequently be published on the Official Journal.
