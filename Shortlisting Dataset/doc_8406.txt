Question for written answer E-003209/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Josefa Andrés Barea (S&D) (5 April 2011) Subject: Bluefin tuna Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is currently managed as two separate stocks — Western Atlantic and Atlantic-Eastern Mediterranean — with recognised genetic differences between the two. So far, surveys involving electronic tagging appear to indicate that there are two populations of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, showing that: 1. Tuna which are tagged in the Atlantic and later enter the Mediterranean go no further than the central Mediterranean area. 2. All the tuna which are tagged in the Mediterranean and subsequently migrate to the Atlantic come only from the western Mediterranean. Bearing in mind the variations in reproductive periods from one region to another and the fact that the application of a single closed season gives rise to regional imbalances affecting both the stock and the fleet, is the Commission looking at the possibility of managing each of these areas independently, thereby avoiding negative consequences such as the possible loss of regional subpopulations?
