it clear that the aim is to ‘punish’ the Member. The applicant has made no attempt whatsoever to claim damages in respect of a material loss. For the reasons set out above, and in the light of the courts’ increasing willingness, as seen in recent years, to award punitive damages, the wording of Article 9 of the PPI must be interpreted in such a way as to provide Members of the European Parliament with effective protection against state prosecution in respect of views expressed in connection with the performance of their duties. The reference to ‘legal proceedings’ in the 1965 text of the PPI must thus today be interpreted as covering an attempt to secure punitive damages by means of civil proceedings. III. Conclusion Your rapporteur therefore recommends that Parliament should defend Mr Giuseppe Gargani’s immunity and privileges.
