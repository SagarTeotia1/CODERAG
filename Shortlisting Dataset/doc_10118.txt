In the light of this, the European Parliament adopted, by 84 votes in favour and none against, a resolution condemning all forms of religious intolerance and violence and the most recent killings in Nigeria. It calls on the Nigerian Government to take immediate and effective measures to protect its citizens, put an end to the violence, implement actively the promotion of and respect for human rights and in particular freedom of religion, and promote a dialogue leading to lasting peace and security in all states. MEPs also call on the European Union to start immediately a political dialogue with the Nigerian Government to promote tolerance and peace between the communities, including the religious authorities, and security of the person, accompanied by respect for human rights, including respect for religious beliefs.
