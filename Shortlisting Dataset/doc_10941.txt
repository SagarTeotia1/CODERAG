Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (25 August 2004) The request for reclassification by two Member States, based on a substantiated request containing available data and scientific elements, was the subject of an extensive consultation by the Medical Device Expert Group (MDEG), which included national authorities and is open to participation to all interest groups organised at European level. Industry participated in this process through the European trade federations, of which the United States of America (US) companies are also members. A special working group, with Industry representation, was created to discuss the subject. The Directive is still a draft and has not yet been adopted. The Commission will notify the draft under article 5.6.2 of the Technical Barrier to Trade Agreement (TBT). After careful consideration of any issues arising, the Commission will submit the draft Directive to the Regulatory Committee, set up under article 7 of Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices OJ L 169 of 12.7.1993 , for Member States’ opinion. There is no reason to believe that Member States will not give due consideration to the interests and protection of their patients and citizens. The Parliament will be involved under the existing comitology procedures.
