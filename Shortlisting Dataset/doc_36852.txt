Economic Forum's Global Governance Initiative; 3. Believes that the World Social Forum should also set out action priorities which can be implemented, instead of merely issuing 352 proposals accepted by panels as has been the case this year; 4. Notes the increasing presence of Chinese and Indian business leaders at the World Economic Forum, which brings home the necessity of improving Europe's competitiveness through implementation of the Lisbon modernising agenda, and of developing closer relationships with the EU's trading partners in Asia and South America as well as with the US in order to complete the transatlantic market by 2015 and to replace the New Transatlantic Agenda with a Transatlantic Partnership Agreement to be implemented from 2007; 5. Welcomes the commitment of several European leaders at Davos to the revival of the European economy; welcomes in this context the Lisbon midterm review report by the Commission and urges individual Member States to shoulder their responsibility for making the revised Lisbon Agenda a success; 6. Considers that in order to support long-term sustainable global growth the US must commit itself to fiscal consolidation while Europe and Japan must accelerate the process of structural reform; 7. Welcomes the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and the signing by 62 companies of the support statement on the Partnering Against Corruption Principles for Countering Bribery (PACI Principles), thereby underlining the importance attached by the corporate sector to the fight against corruption and bribery; 8. Welcomes the selection of 29 companies as 2005's Technology Pioneers by the World Economic Forum as part of its Technology Pioneers programme, which enables companies involved in the development of potential life-changing technological innovation to be fully integrated into Forum activities; 9. Reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals; welcomes the emphasis placed by both Fora on making world trade fairer and freer; urges the negotiators at the WTO to take this advice seriously; also points out the beneficial effect that the dismantling of trade barriers would have on the recovery of regions hit by the tsunami; underlines the positive impact which the liberalisation of agricultural trade would have on developing countries; 10. Considers globalisation a key element in promoting competitiveness and growth within the EU and in developing countries; underlines the importance of the multilateral approach to trade policy, especially for the developing and least-developed countries, whose interests are best served in a multilateral framework, and the multilateral governance needed to ensure a free and fair trade system worldwide; therefore supports the WTO as the principal forum for the management of globalisation, through trade opening and the strengthening of multilateral rules, and the pursuit of sustainable development; 11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.
