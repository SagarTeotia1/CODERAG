Joint answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission Written questions : P-2776/08 , E-2790/08 (9 July 2008) The Commission has been informed of the refusal of the application of MAT — Macedonian Airlines, an air carrier licensed by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to provide charter services to/from Greek airports. While the issue is not regulated by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the Commission considers that a refusal of this kind, if motivated only on the basis of the place of establishment of the company concerned, would become incompatible with the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) Agreement, once it enters into force. The ECAA Agreement OJ L 285, 16.10.2006. was signed in June 2006, but has not yet been ratified by all parties. Greece has made a statement for the Council's minutes that it can provisionally apply this Agreement pursuant to its Article 29(3) only from the date on which it has notified the Secretariat-General of the Council, as the depository of this Agreement, the completion of its internal procedure necessary for its entry into force. However, at the ECAA Joint Committee meeting in December 2006, the Chairman informed the ECAA partners that the European Community and the Member States, pending ratification by the parties, considered the ECAA agreement as applicable at administrative level. This was reaffirmed at the second ECAA Joint Committee meeting on 14 December 2007 in Zagreb, where the parties also undertook to complete ratification by the first half of 2008. The Commission is in contact with the authorities of both Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on this matter.
