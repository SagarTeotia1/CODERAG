The European Parliament, meeting in its plenary session in Strasbourg, is expected to vote on this text for the first time in May. European Social Affairs ministers will then discuss the proposal. The text is unlikely to be approved at this first reading. To be adopted, it must receive the support of MEPs and all 25 Member States. The proposal is a directive, which means that, once adopted by the EU institutions, it must also be transposed into national legislation in the 25 Member States, who will have two years in which to do this. It will not apply to European workers until this two-year period has elapsed. 20050819STO00760 EN 1 PHOTO 20050818PHT00276.jpg -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN
