Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (13 October 2008) The Commission receives considerable amount of courier from citizens complaining about alleged violations of fundamental rights, including violation of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities (for instance, concerning discrimination). While the Commission does not keep lists of such letters, it replies to all of them in accordance with the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for staff of the Commission in their relations with the public OJ L 267, 20.10.2000. . If the complaint falls outside the scope of Community competence, the Commission informs the author thereof, as well as of the fact that it cannot intervene in the matter. In cases where the complaint concerns the implementation of a Community instrument, the Commission takes the necessary measures to ensure that Community law is respected. Moreover, according to Directive 2000/43/EC Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, OJ L 180, 19.7.2000. , Member States have to designate a body or bodies for the promotion of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin. These bodies must be competent, inter alia , to provide independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints about discrimination. When the complaints received by the Commission concern issues that have to be dealt with at national level, the Commission informs the citizens about the possibility to request help from these bodies and provides their contact details.
