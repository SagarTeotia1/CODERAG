Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (13 March 2012) The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) requires the States Parties to take appropriate measures to ensure access to persons with disabilities, on an equal basis with others, to information and communications, including emergency services UNCRPD, Article 9. . The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 COM(2010) 636 final, 15.11.2010. aims at ensuring effective implementation of the UN Convention in the EU and highlights ‘accessibility’ as one of its priorities. In line with the UNCRPD, Article 26 of the Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC This directive is included under the declaration of EU competences annexed to the Council Decision for the Conclusion of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC, which had to be transposed in national law by 25 May 2011, requires Member States to ensure that access to emergency services for disabled users is equivalent to that enjoyed by other users. The same article provides that 112 calls shall be answered and handled at least as expeditiously and effectively as calls to the national emergency number or numbers. Recital 41 of Directive 2009/136/EC gives further indications as to the Member States’ obligations relating to disabled end-users. However, a number of Member States have not yet fully transposed Directive 2009/136/EC and, as a consequence, the Commission has launched infringement procedures against them, including against Greece. These are currently ongoing. The Commission's services are assessing the current state of implementation of the EU legislative framework. The ICT-funded, REACH 112 project ‘Responding to all citizens needing help’ is currently validating implementation and interoperability of accessible alternatives to traditional voice telephony suitable for all using the concept of ‘total conversation’, including Real Time Text.
