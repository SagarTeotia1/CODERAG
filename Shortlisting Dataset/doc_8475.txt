WRITTEN QUESTION E-0584/06 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 February 2006) Subject: Household and corporate borrowing in Greece According to experts' estimates, total household and corporate debt in Greece is expected to exceed 100 % of the country's GDP by 2010, with households accounting for 52 % and companies 49 %. In nominal terms, Greece appears to be below the EU average, which is expected to amount to 132 % by 2010. 1. Could the Commission provide detailed information on the expected levels of household and corporate borrowing (separately for both categories) in all the Member States by 2010? 2. What are the assessments regarding the correlation between corporate borrowing and the prospects for growth in the Greek economy? Are there any estimates concerning the profitability of corporate lending in Greece and the other Member States (in terms of rate of growth of GDP, job creation, etc.)? 3. What is the Commission's assessment of the macroeconomic impact of the upward trend in Greek household and corporate borrowing, given the high rates of interest in Greece and the already high deficit in the country's balance of payments on current account?
