WRITTEN QUESTION E-5817/07 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (26 November 2007) Subject: ‘Black List’ of terrorist suspects The Committee on Legal Affairs of the Council of Europe has recently accepted a draft report which states that the holding of a ‘Black List’ of terrorist suspects by the UN Security Council and the EU is completely arbitrary. Does the Commission indeed hold such a list? How many suspects are on it? Does the Commission agree with the aforementioned report? Will the Commission react to this report and how?
