  "query": "Is the Commission aware of the possibility that, when the time comes, the Betuwe line — the as yet uncompleted freight line between the port of Rotterdam and the German hinterland via the existing border crossing between Zevenaar (NL) and Emmerich (D) — will not be used, or will hardly be used, because the businesses which might have been interested in it consider the scale of charges exorbitant (it will be eight times as expensive to send ore or coal by rail), while lower charges would result in excessive losses on the necessary maintenance of the line?",
