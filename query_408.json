  "query": "Does it agree that the provision that a Member State of the EU must unilaterally provide data on European passengers in order to be included in the programme not only violates the principle of reciprocity applying to all Member States of the EU but is also flagrantly contrary to the declared wish of both the EU and the USA to negotiate a new joint agreement on the legal transfer and use of data concerning European passengers? If so, what representations has it made to the US Government and the US Congress on this matter and what further measures does it intend to take?",
